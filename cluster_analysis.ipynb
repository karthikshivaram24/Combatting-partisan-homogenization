      "Judge dismisses suit claiming Trump collusion with Russian hackers, WikiLeaks in DNC breach\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A federal judge in D.C. has dismissed a lawsuit alleging President Trump’s election campaign conspired with Russian hackers and WikiLeaks to publish stolen Democratic National Committee documents during the 2016 race.          U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle ruled Tuesday in favor of tossing out the invasion of privacy lawsuit over lack of jurisdiction, writing in a 45-page opinion that the plaintiffs — two DNC donors and a former staffer affected by the leak — failed to adequately connect the alleged crimes to the nation’s capital.          “Campaign meetings, canvassing voters, and other regular business activities of a political campaign do not constitute activities related to the conspiracies alleged in the complaint,” wrote Judge Huvelle, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton. “The same is true of the fact that the Trump Campaign’s foreign policy team was based in the District. Its mere presence here, without it undertaking overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracies, does not represent a suit-related contact.          “It bears emphasizing that this Court’s ruling is not based on a finding that there was no collusion between defendants and Russia during the 2016 presidential election,” she added. “This is the wrong forum for plaintiffs’ lawsuit. The Court takes no position on the merits of plaintiffs’ claims.”          Watchdog group Protect Democracy filed the lawsuit in July 2017 on behalf of DNC donors Eric Schoenberg and Roy Cockrum and former DNC staffer Scott Comer. Their personal information became publicly accessible after WikiLeaks released internal DNC data in 2016 allegedly sourced by Russian state-sponsored hackers.          Their attorneys subsequently claimed that the Trump campaign and Roger Stone, a former Trump campaign adviser, had colluded with both Moscow and the anti-secrecy website as “part of a deliberate campaign to interfere in the U.S. election and tilt its outcome in favor of Donald Trump” — an allegation currently being investigated by federal authorities including special counsel Robert Mueller.          “While we are disappointed in and respectfully disagree with today’s decision from the District Court to dismiss this case on the grounds that it does not belong in Washington, D.C., this case is far from over,” Protect Democracy said in a statement in response to the judge’s ruling.          Ian Bassin, Protect Democracy’s executive director, said the group “will consider our options and will continue to fight to ensure that our clients get the justice they deserve and that the Trump campaign and its associates will be held accountable for their actions.”          The U.S. intelligence community concluded in early 2017 that Russian state-sponsored hackers had breached the DNC and other targets as part of a Kremlin-authorized campaign that involved relaying the documents to outlets including WikiLeaks for publication.          Mr. Mueller was appointed by the Justice Department in May 2017 to investigate the race and any potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.          Earlier Tuesday, meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee announced that its own bipartisan investigation affirmed the results of the government’s previous conclusions with respect to Russia’s election meddling.          Russia has previously denied interfering in the 2016 election, and the Trump campaign and Mr. Stone has denied colluding with Russia or WikiLeaks to release stolen documents during the race.          Mr. Stone said in a statement that he is “gratified and delighted” by the judge’s ruling.          “Even though the case was not decided on this basis, plaintiffs provided no evidence or proof whatsoever of their central left-wing conspiracy theory: that I somehow worked with the Russian state to hack the DNC email servers and shared the fruits of this alleged hacking with Wikileaks or the Trump campaign. This is false and can therefore never be proven in any jurisdiction,” Mr. Stone said.          WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange has previously claimed that the source of the DNC leak was unaffiliated with the Russian government.\n",

      "Conservatives Are Gunning for Eric Holder\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tea party activists, gun-rights fanatics, and others on the right have recently stepped up their calls for President Obama to fire Attorney General Eric Holder over his handling of the Operation Fast and Furious gun scandal. They’ve persuaded 52 members of Congress, a couple of senators, and many GOP presidential candidates to call for his ouster. Mitt Romney joined the chorus over the weekend, telling reporters in New Hampshire, “Either Mr. Holder himself should resign or the president should ask for his resignation or remove him…It’s unacceptable for him to continue in that position, given the fact that he has misled Congress and entirely botched the investigation of the Fast and Furious program.”          Romney’s comments came just a few days before Holder is expected to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday, where Republicans are promising a full grilling over his handling of the botched anti-gun smuggling program.          The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) cooked up Operation Fast and Furious in an effort to capture high-level Mexican gun runners who were buying guns in the United States with the help of straw buyers. ATF officials watched as individuals connected to drug cartels illegally bought copious amounts of high-powered weapons in Arizona gun shops that were cooperating with the government. Then, using a technique dubbed “gun walking,” they planned to track the guns up the food chain to ensnare the big-time crime bosses.          From the outset, the program was controversial within the ATF, where agents were unaccustomed to letting criminals walk away with lethal weapons. Then, hundreds of those guns went missing, and some later turned up at grisly crime scenes in Mexico, where they’d been used by members of the Sinaloa drug cartel. The guns have been linked to about 300 deaths in Mexico. When a border agent named Brian Terry was killed in Arizona last December, guns traced to Fast and Furious were discovered at the scene.          In late January 2011, the US Attorney’s office in Arizona unsealed a host of indictments against alleged gun runners caught in the operation, including Jaime Avila, who allegedly bought the weapons found at the scene of Brian Terry’s murder. That’s when mentions of the Fast and Furious operation first surfaced, and it wasn’t long before Terry became the poster child for all that Republicans and tea partiers see wrong with the Obama administration.          In March, the GOP’s designated Obama watchdog, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, launched an investigation into the scandal. With the help of ATF whistleblowers, he has relentlessly attacked the administration and Holder over the bungled gun op.          In May, Holder told the House Judiciary Committee that he didn’t know about the ATF plan to let the guns “walk” into Mexico until shortly after Terry was killed. But Republicans claim that documents unearthed by Issa’s committee indicate that Holder knew about the operation much earlier and allege he lied to Congress in his May testimony. Holder has said that the documents, which are essentially weekly briefings that include short summaries of matters of interest from various agencies, don’t show that he was fully briefed about what the ATF field agents in Phoenix were up to. His answers have failed to satisfy Republican investigators.          Almost since taking the helm of the Justice Department, Holder has been a target of conservatives. Activists have hammered him regularly over the past three years, over everything from the Department of Justice’s refusal to investigate the community activist group ACORN to his handling of the New Black Panther voting rights noncontroversy to his attempts to try terrorism suspects in US civilian courts.          But the drumbeat for his ouster has increased substantially of late. With the help of the National Rifle Association, Fast and Furious has become one of the right’s latest conspiracy theories. It goes something like this: Fast and Furious was actually a scheme by Holder to promote gun control. The NRA claims that Holder allowed American gun dealers to sell AK-47s and other powerful assault rifles so that they would be used to kill people in the Mexican drug war, thereby creating the political will for more restrictions on gun ownership in the United States.          The NRA did not respond to a request for comment, but Wayne LaPierre, the organization’s CEO, told Newsmax in October that Fast and Furious was designed “so they could stick more gun legislation on honest American gun owners of the United States.”          The NRA has set up a website called FireHolder.com and has run TV ads accusing Holder of committing perjury. Even without the NRA fanning the flames, the rhetoric over Fast and Furious has been heated. In Phoenix, Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, who’s considering a run for Congress, went on CNN to suggest that Holder and other federal officials involved in Fast and Furious were accessories to murder. That accusation was echoed by Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), who told the Daily Caller in October, “When you facilitate that, and a murder or a felony occurs, you’re called an accessory.”          Gosar is one of 52 members of Congress who have asked for Holder’s resignation. Last Thursday, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), who has also been investigating the scandal, dressed down Holder and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, saying that their claims of ignorance about the operation are implausible. From the Senate floor, Grassley said, “Two of these guns showed up at the murder scene of Agent Terry. And, if that’s not serious enough to brief up to the top of the department, then I don’t know what is.”          Tea party activists are happy to see the issue gathering official attention. “You don’t have to be a right-wing conspiracy nut to say, what’s going on?” says Trent Humphries, the founder of the Tucson Tea Party.          Glen Davis, a member of Arizona’s Williams Tea Party said in an email: “Although you would probably get a variety of answers from various TEA party members, I feel confident in stating that the attitude of most TEA party members is that he should be removed from office with the additional statement, ‘You have the right to remain silent.'”          Holder hasn’t said much about Fast and Furious, largely because he asked the Justice Department’s inspector general to review program and the inquiry is ongoing. In addition, Brian Terry’s murder is still an active criminal investigation, and all of the files related to the prosecution have been sealed so that not even his family, apparently, knows what’s going on with it.          But after Gosar accused Holder of being an accessory to murder, the attorney general fired off a letter to Issa’s committee (PDF) complaining about his treatment. He wrote in October: “I simply cannot sit idly by as a Majority Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform suggests, as happened this week, that law enforcement and government employees who devote their lives to protecting our citizens be considered ‘accessories to murder.’ Such irresponsible and inflammatory rhetoric must be repudiated in the strongest possible terms…I call on you to denounce these statements.”          Holder dinged the GOP House members for making such a big deal out of Fast and Furious even as they continue to block efforts that would aid federal officials in cracking down on gun smuggling to Mexico, including a rule that would require the reporting of “multiple long gun purchases in a short period of time.” Noting that it was unacceptable for ATF agents to lose track of a single gun during the bureau’s interdiction efforts, he said, “Equally unacceptable, however, is the fact that too many in Congress are opposed to any discussion of fixing loopholes in our laws that facilitate the staggering flow of guns each year across our border to the south…[i]t seems clear that some in Congress are more interested in using this regrettable incident to score political points than in addressing the underlying problem.” Expect the real duel to come on Thursday, when Holder faces off with the GOPers who are gunning for him.\n",

      "Basement Biden, traveling Trump test campaign extremes in coronavirus era\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden is taking baby steps to expand his campaign during the coronavirus crisis, moving his online broadcasts from his basement to his front porch.          Meanwhile, President Trump, already enjoying the more grandiose stage of the White House Rose Garden for his coronavirus updates, has even grander aspirations of a quick return to arena rallies, complete with throngs of his adoring fans.          As the nation ponders the new normal as states reopen their economies, political campaigns are trying to figure out what’s possible in the coronavirus era.          Mr. Trump doesn’t have any of his signature campaign rallies on his schedule, but he has been getting out of the White House, with trips to Arizona, Pennsylvania and, on Thursday, Michigan — states that are expected to play a big role in deciding the victor in November.          Mr. Biden, the presumed Democratic nominee, has yet to leave his Delaware home and instead is conducting interviews and campaign events via an internet connection.          The Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment on his plans, but the Trump campaign is reveling in the dichotomy.          “The president has been clear that he wants to return to holding rallies and connecting with the American people,” said Tim Murtaugh, spokesman for the Trump campaign. “We suspect that Joe Biden will stay in close proximity to his teleprompter as long as possible.”          Darrell West, an analyst at the Brookings Institution, said Mr. Trump should be excited about his opportunities to break free of Washington, where his clashes with reporters, and at times his own science advisers, at coronavirus updates proved to be must-see TV, and not to the president’s benefit.          “It would be better for Trump to speak at rallies than have arguments with news reporters at his daily briefings,” Mr. West said. “The latter exchanges have provided a lot of material for Democratic ad-makers.”          Mr. Biden, meanwhile, could benefit from any interactions, so he can “reassure voters he is up to the job.”          “He is relatively invisible right now and letting Trump dominate the news cycles,” Mr. West said.          At least for now, it has worked. Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump in virtually every national poll and in most surveys of the head-to-head match-up in key states.          Steve Mitchell, a Michigan-based GOP strategist, said the Biden campaign is benefiting from keeping its candidate under wraps by using a controlled virtual environment. But at some point, that’s going to end.          “Once Biden is out there, Trump will no longer be running against a straw man,” Mr. Mitchell said. “He will be running against a man who has a history of making gaffes on stage.”          Still, the Trump campaign is projecting confidence in its ability to beat Mr. Biden in all facets of campaigning. Brad Pascarle says they have built a juggernaut of a campaign, comparing it to the “Death Star” from Star Wars.          Of course, the Death Star fell victim to a band of rebel warriors — twice.          In Mr. Biden’s case, that band of warriors now includes former President Barack Obama, who is increasingly active in politicking, with sharp jabs at Mr. Trump.          Mr. Biden is also deploying the likes of Sen. Kamala Harris, a fierce one-time rival for the Democratic nomination, and even Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a backer of Sen. Bernard Sanders, who is now co-chair of Mr. Biden’s policy task force on climate change.          The goal is to show a unified party front, with Mr. Biden hoping to heal some of the divisions that were exposed during the primary.          Rick Gorka, of the Trump Victory PAC, said Mr. Biden needs the help of those surrogates because his campaign is so “anemic.”          “The president energizes voters unlike any other candidate,” Mr. Gorka said. “When Air Force One lands, the seal goes on the podium and that is when the show begins.”          As soon as Mr. Trump returns to the campaign trail, Mr. Biden will be pressured to follow.          “He has to, but I think regardless of what he does I think he is going to look small, just because of the lack of energy and the lack of crowds,” Mr. Gorka said.          The irony is that swing-state Democratic governors will hold a lot of sway over when and where Mr. Trump can hold rallies.          That includes Govs. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, who have been among the more cautious executives in their responses to the coronavirus, drawing mounting criticism from Mr. Trump and his backers.          “The president has been clear that he believes that some Democrats have dragged their feet in reopening their states because they believe they can gain some political advantage,” Mr. Murtaugh said. “The economy has to get going again because a prolonged lockdown comes with its own health problems, on top of what the coronavirus has caused.”          Mr. Trump has taken direct aim at Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, suggesting he could be trying to use the coronavirus as an excuse to put the brakes on the Republican National Convention.          The GOP believes the event will happen as scheduled in late August in Charlotte, drawing upwards of 50,000 to the city.          “They’re playing politics, as you know, by delaying the openings.,” Mr. Trump told The Washington Examiner in a recent interview. “To me that’s politics. They think it’s a bad thing for me if they delay the opening. I think it’s bad for them. And you have people protesting outside, and those people like Trump.”          Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cooper, said that’s not the case.          “As the governor said, pandemics cannot be political,” Ms. Weiner said. “North Carolina is using the data and the science based on White House guidance to inform our three-phased approach to lifting restrictions. The health and safety of North Carolinians is the top priority as we battle COVID-19.”          Mr. Cooper began easing restrictions in his state on May 8, and he is allowing restaurants and salons to open at 50% capacity on Friday as part of his “modest” phase 2 reopening plan. He also is removing the state’s stay-at-home order Friday at 5 p.m.          Michael Bitzer, chairman of the Department of Politics at Catawba College, said Mr. Trump’s comments have put Mr. Cooper in “an awkward position.” The governor is likely eager for the potential economic lift that the convention could produce, but the risks of a mass gathering probably contradict what he’s hearing from his health advisers.          “With all that said, I think we are truly flying blind into the summer and what the fall may hold,” Mr. Bitzer said. “The virus will likely have the last word, whether partisans like it or not.”\n",

      "Behind the Secret Conservative Campaign to Crush Karl Rove\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Groundswell, the recently created coalition of prominent right-wing activists and journalists, gathers weekly to coordinate messaging and plot strategy for “a 30 front war seeking to fundamentally transform the nation.” These sessions usually fixate on how best to battle the president, congressional Democrats, and progressive groups. But their 30-front war also includes something of a civil war: a fierce crusade against the Republican establishment and Karl Rove, the GOP strategist and Fox News pundit.          Rove is a regular topic of discussion—and frustration—at Groundswell’s Wednesday morning meetings, according to the documents obtained by medianame. At these sessions, and in messages shared by participants on Groundswell’s Google group page, Groundswellers often gripe that the GOP’s inside-the-Beltway crowd wants to marginalize the party’s ideological die-hards and recruit, promote, and support political candidates deemed less strident and more electable. Rove especially ticked off tea-party-minded conservatives in February when the super-PAC he advises, American Crossroads, announced it was launching the Conservative Victory Project, which would try to block far-right candidates from blowing key races, as Missouri’s Todd Akin and Indiana’s Richard Mourdock did in Senate contests last year.          Yet as Rove kicked off this project, Groundswellers, in closed-doors meetings, initiated an effort to crush Rove, who they believed had helped shape a post-election post-mortem by the Republican National Committee that called on the party to temper its message to appeal to a broader swath of voters.          At the group’s March 20 meeting, Groundswell participants reviewed the details of this vigorous anti-Rove endeavor, according to notes prepared after the session. This memo referred to a “two front war” to tear down the prominent GOP strategist who engineered the political triumphs of George W. Bush. Under the subject head “ROVE PROJECT,” the memo reported:          Rove is still actively networking and building his financial capabilities, an indication that we are not yet being effective. His associates have quietly contributed to the drafting of the RNC document, Autopsy. The Autopsy Report…has drawn fire from the Tea Party, social conservatives and conservatives in general. It undermines the RNC platform… The Two Front War: The two front war covers finances and reputation. Rove has relationships built over the last two decades. He must become toxic among the grass roots and among his base. His effectiveness has been called into question on Sunday talk shows and at CPAC. Regarding financing, the donors to his Crossroads [super-PAC] are public. They must be educated to the fact, Rove is not a conservative and his efforts are not effective. Rove’s position as party spokesperson was established as a result of the Bush election. Rove gained the title and the credit for being the “great architect.” Fox has given Rove a platform and just renewed his contract. In truth, Rove no more represents conservatives then Jessie Jackson or Al Sharpton represent all Blacks.          The memo cautioned that smashing Rove would take time: “Rove has been building his power base for decades. Change requires time and patience.” It suggested “powerful messaging points” to use against him: “Rove does not speak for GOP like Sharpton does not speak for black community” and “Who put you in charge?”          “Rove has relationships built over the last two decades. He must become toxic among the grass roots and among his base.”          The Rove Project was a key agenda item at other Groundswell get-togethers. At a February 20 meeting, Groundswell participants talked about how best to “continue efforts to educate conservatives to this real and present danger to our future success”—meaning Rove—and attendees were informed that Ken Blackwell, a former Ohio secretary of state now affiliated with the Family Research Council, was identifying donors to conservative causes who “need specific attention.” That is, Blackwell was compiling a list of conservative funders to pressure to boycott Rove.          During a March 6 meeting, it was announced that the Rove Project would be one of Groundswell’s 10 working groups. (Others included national security, messaging, ground game, immigration, and Benghazi.) Sandy Rios, a fellow Fox News contributor, was put in charge of the campaign to discredit Rove. Weeks later, though, a Groundswell memo noted that the Conservative Action Project—a coalition of more than 100 right-wing organizations that is chaired by former Attorney General Edwin Meese—would be “taking the lead” on the Rove Project.          Rove did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, one of the leading members of Groundswell and the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.          Through Groundswell’s Google group, members were asked in February to sign a letter organized by Diana Banister, a Groundsweller and a partner at the Shirley & Banister PR firm, demanding the firing of Jonathan Collegio, American Crossroads’ communications director. Collegio’s sin: He had called Brent Bozell, a conservative media critic, a “hater” in an interview. (Collegio had been reacting to Bozell’s attack on Rove’s plan to oppose unelectable conservative Republican candidates.) The letter, addressed to American Crossroads president Steven Law, proclaimed, “You obviously mean to have a war with conservatives and the Tea Party.”          The Groundswellers certainly seem to believe they are engaged in all-out combat with Rove and GOP insiders. In February, Blackwell posted an article on Groundswell’s Google group page and stated, “War has been declared on the conservative movement.” The article was about Rove’s effort to back credible GOP candidates.\n",

      "Dems may pursue perjury charges against Sondland: Welch\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A Democratic congressman involved in the House impeachment investigation said Tuesday that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, may be at risk of perjury charges as a result of his closed-door deposition last week before three House committees investigating impeachment. Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, who serves on the House intelligence committee, told MSNBC’s “The Last Word” Tuesday that new evidence shows that Sondland worked more closely with President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on foreign policy directives than he has previously let on during his 10-hour testimony before Congress last week. GORDON SONDLAND, AMBASSADOR INVOLVED IN UKRAINE CONTROVERSY, TO TESTIFY TRUMP TOLD HIM 'NO QUID PRO QUO'          MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell asked Welch: \"Is Gordon Sondland in danger of perjury charges for his testimony to your committee?\" “I think he is,\" Welch responded. \"When he presented himself, he was a rich guy that bought an ambassadorship and he pretended it was a good day for him. He got a job he wanted but he was pretty naïve he didn’t know the real meeting was going on in the room next door.”          “But the evidence is now coming out that he was a very active instrument to try to assist Giuliani in the effort to have this rogue foreign policy,” Welch continued. Sondland testified last week that Trump told him there was no quid pro quo when it came to Trump’s controversial July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy. He also said he was concerned that the president delegated to Giuliani foreign policy responsibilities that he thought belonged to the State Department but followed Trump's instructions anyway. \"We were also disappointed by the president's direction that we involve Mr. Giuliani,\" Sondland said in the remarks. \"Our view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the President's personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine.\" Congress on Tuesday heard from William Taylor, who exchanged text messages with Sondland this summer and fall. Taylor testified that he was told via text messages that Trump wanted military aid to Ukraine connected to the country’s willingness to investigate the 2016 U.S. presidential election and Joe Biden’s family’s business dealings in the country, The Washington Post reported. He was the last official expected to give a deposition from behind closed doors. Last week, Democrats asked Sondland, whose name surfaced in a whistleblower complaint in August that helped spur the impeachment inquiry, about text messages that were provided to the committees earlier this month by former Ukrainian envoy Kurt Volker. The messages show Sondland, Volker and Taylor discussing an arrangement in which Zelenskiy would be offered a White House visit in exchange for a public statement by Ukraine committing to undertake investigations into the 2016 U.S. presidential election and into Burisma, the gas company linked to Hunter Biden. One text exchange that has attracted attention involves Taylor telling Sondland he thought it was \"crazy\" to withhold military aid from Ukraine \"for help with a political campaign.\" Sondland replied that Trump had been clear about his intentions and that there was no quid pro quo. \"I asked the president: 'What do you want from Ukraine?'\" Sondland said. \"The president responded, 'Nothing. There is no quid pro quo.' The president repeated: 'no quid pro quo' multiple times. This was a very short call. And I recall the President was in a bad mood.\"\n",

      "Castro Argues Iowa And New Hampshire Aren't Diverse Enough To Be Early Primary States\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Former Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julian Castro stated on Sunday that both Iowa and New Hampshire should give up their famed status as the first states in the nation to hold a caucus and a primary due to their lack of diverse constituents.          “I actually do believe that we need to change the order of the states because I don’t believe that we’re the same country we were in 1972 — that is when Iowa first held its caucus first,” Castro said while speaking to NBC News. “And by the time we have the next presidential election in 2024, it will have been more than 50 years since 1972. Our country has changed a lot in those 50 years. The Democratic Party has changed a lot.”          “What I really appreciate about Iowans and the folks in New Hampshire is that they take this process very seriously. They vet the candidates, they show up at town halls, they give people a good hearing,” he continued. “At the same time, demographically, it’s not reflective of the United States as a whole, certainly not reflective of the Democratic Party, and I believe that other states should have their chance.”          “So, yes, of course we need to find other states,” Castro added. “That doesn’t mean that Iowa and New Hampshire still can’t play an important role, but I don’t believe that forever we should be married to Iowa and New Hampshire going first, and that’s just the truth of the way that I see it.          Castro’s remarks come after his Democratic presidential challenger Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was asked the same question only days earlier while attending an Environmental Justice forum in Orangeburg, South Carolina. Warren notably dodged the question, rather contending that she is just “a player in the game.”          While the former Obama official has been polling below 1% on average among Democratic primary voters in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Warren is leading the crowded primary field in both states. As of publication, the Massachusetts lawmaker sits at more than 21% support and 19% support on average in Iowa and New Hampshire, respectively.          Last week Castro’s campaign revealed that it had fired its entire staff in both New Hampshire and South Carolina as it seeks to focus on opportunities in Iowa and Nevada. The news came after the campaign gave supporters an ultimatum to raise $0.8 million in donations by the end of October or else risk the end of his White House bid.          Castro ultimately surpassed the goal and generated nearly $1 million by the deadline. The campaign said the fundraising haul will provide the presidential hopeful with the necessary resources to “sustain the campaign and make a push for the November and December Democratic debates.”          Thus far, only ten candidates in the presidential primary field have qualified for the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) next debate — Castro has not yet met the required threshold.          “I can imagine he’s frustrated,” said New Hampshire Democratic Chair Ray Buckley. “But blaming his campaign’s challenges on the voters of Iowa and New Hampshire is a bit much.”\n",

      "Two anti-pipeline activists indicted over efforts to sabotage Dakota Access pipeline\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Two anti-pipeline activists have been indicted on federal charges stemming from multiple 2016-17 attacks on the Dakota Access Pipeline in Iowa, including burning pipes and valves with torches.          Jessica Rae Reznicek and Ruby Katherine Montoya each face up to 40 years in prison if convicted on the nine criminal counts, including conspiracy to damage an energy facility, use of fire in commission of a felony, and malicious use of fire.          Ms. Montoya was recently arrested in Arizona, while Ms. Reznicek was released Monday pending trial Dec. 2 after appearing in federal court in Des Moines, according to U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa Marc Krickbaum.          The defendants were accused of conspiring to “knowingly and willfully damage and attempt to damage the property of an energy facility” at a cost that exceeded or would have exceeded $100,000, said the U.S. Attorney’s Office in a Tuesday press release.          Both women have made no secret of their efforts to sabotage the pipeline, appearing in a July 2017 video posted by Unicorn Riot in which they claimed responsibility for destroying construction equipment with gasoline, rags and tires; burning exposed valve sites, and attempting to piece portions of empty pipeline with torches.          Their goal was “to push this corporation beyond their means to eventually abandon the project,” said their statement posted on Unicorn Riot.          “Some may view these actions as violent, but be not mistaken,” said Ms. Montoya, wearing a “Stop the Pipeline” t-shirt. “We acted from our hearts and never threatened human life nor personal property. What we did do was fight a private corporation that has run rampantly across our country seizing land and polluting our nation’s water supply.”          After speaking to onlookers, they were shown being arrested by the Iowa State Patrol as they used hammers to tear down letters on the Iowa Utilities Board sign in Des Moines.          They expressed frustration over the lack of media coverage of the destruction, blaming Energy Transfer Partners, which built the pipeline, and the federal government for keeping the details from the public.          “These actions of great public interest were hardly reported, and the federal government and Energy Transfer Partners colluded together to lie and withhold vital information to the public,” said Ms. Reznicek.          Before launching their sabotage campaign in November 2016 on the night of the presidential election, they said they tried to stop the project by gathering signatures, testifying at hearings, and participating in civil disobedience, marches, rallies, hunger strikes, boycotts and encampments.          “Our conclusion is that the system is broken and it is up to us as individuals to take peaceful action to remedy it, and this is what we did out of necessity,” said Ms. Montoya.          Thousands of activists descended on South Dakota for the massive 2016 anti-DAPL protest near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, which failed to stop the pipeline but left behind 48 million pounds of trash and debris that was ultimately cleaned up by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at a cost of more than $1 million.          The U.S. Attorney’s Office emphasized that an indictment is only an accusation, and that the defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty.          U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger is slated to preside over the trial in Des Moines.\n",

      "Elizabeth Warren's Plan to Pay for Medicare for All Shows How She's Different Than Bernie Sanders\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth Warren has built her top-polling presidential campaign on her reputation as a liberal fighter and iconoclast willing to take on the biggest inequities besetting the middle class. That rhetoric has, at times, made her virtually indistinguishable from her friend and rival in the Democratic field, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.          But as a policy wonk and politician, Warren has often been much more of a pragmatist than Sanders. As the architect of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and, later, as a Senator from Massachusetts, she regularly sought compromise, worked within institutional strictures, and embraced incremental improvements to pass small-bore legislation, rather than holding out for wholesale reform.          Warren’s detailed proposal, which was published on Medium on Friday and describes how she would pay for Medicare For All, is a reflection of that divide.          While Warren’s plan embraces the relatively radical idea of Medicare for All—universal, government-funded health care for all Americans—it is hardly a breathless document. Throughout the roughly 9,000-word post, Warren repeatedly reminds supporters of the complexity of actually accomplishing the goal legislatively. She describes Medicare for All as a “long-term goal” four times and reminds readers that it likely won’t happen in a single term: “it is possible to eventually move to a Medicare for All system,” the document says.          “Of course, moving to this kind of system will not be easy and will not happen overnight,” Warren’s plan reads. “This is why every serious proposal for Medicare for All contemplates a significant transition period.”          The plan says it would cost $20.5 trillion in new government spending over a decade, a price tag that Warren says she would pay for with new taxes on corporations and the wealthy, but not the middle class. It describes in relatively minute detail, complete with links, how the federal government would curb the cost of health care by reducing administrative costs and reforming payment, and increasing competition among hospitals.          Sanders, in contrast, recently told CNBC he does not plan to release a definitive plan of how he’d pay for Medicare for All. His Medicare for All bill does not include details on financing. In April, his campaign released a short list of options for funding the health care program, although none would cover the full cost. At Sanders’s rally in Queens last month, several of the speakers sidestepped details, describing him instead as the “only one” who could champion the progressive policies he represents.          Warren said Friday that she will disclose more information about her Medicare for All transition plan in the coming weeks. It will, she said, address concerns raised by unions, hospitals, and medical professionals, as well as those who currently have private insurance or work for private insurance companies. Those groups have all raised concerns about all Medicare For All plans, including Warren’s, that call for eventually eliminating private insurance.          Moderate Democratic candidates, including Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, have seized on those groups’ concerns. Some have embraced more incremental plans that would offer voters the option of buying into a Medicare-like program, while keeping the private insurance industry intact.          Much of the reaction to Warren’s proposal on Friday centered around the fact it was, at last, an answer to the oft-asked question of whether her Medicare for All plan would raise taxes on the middle class. The question has come up repeatedly at Democratic debates, but she has avoided answering it. As Warren has risen in the polls, her Democratic rivals have increasingly needled her for failing to do so. “Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything—except this,” Buttigieg said at the last debate. Supporters applauded Warren’s proposal as a “win for the Medicare for All movement.”          Voters, meanwhile, are now armed with another detail to help them differentiate a crowded Democratic field. Whether Warren’s commitment to pragmatism and policies can win over those who love the big ideas will still be an important test for her campaign.\n",

      "800 soldiers, rushed to Middle East, return home to Fort Bragg\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fort Bragg welcomed home 800 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division Thursday. They had been rushed to the Middle East in late December to assist with regional security after protesters attacked the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.          It was unclear when the remaining 2,700 soldiers who were deployed to Kuwait in the days that followed, will return to the United States as well. The bulk of the 82nd Airborne's 1st Brigade rushed from North Carolina to the region as tensions with Iran were heightened following the U.S. drone strike in January that killed a top Iranian general.          \"Nearly 800 Paratroopers from the 2nd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, along with members of the 3rd Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, the 3rd Battalion, 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment and several enabler teams from the Immediate Response Force Brigade (IRF) began their redeployment from the Middle East back to Fort Bragg, N.C.,\" according to a statement from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division.          \"The remainder of the 1st Brigade Combat Team remains deployed providing support to the CENTCOM Commander for any missions deemed necessary,\" the statement continued.          A complement of about 500 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division's 1st Brigade was ordered to rush to Kuwait on Dec. 31, following the storming of the outside perimeter of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad by Iranian-backed militiamen. Hundreds of these forces were surged into Baghdad as reinforcements, while hundreds of U.S. military forces serving in administrative roles were taken out of Iraq.          The entire 3,500-soldier unit was ordered to Kuwait following the heightened tensions with Iran after the Jan. 2 U.S. drone strike in Baghdad that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the top commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force.          The drone strike led to concerns that the United States and Iran might be drawn into a regional conflict, but tensions eased following Iran's retaliatory missile strike on two bases in Iraq that housed American troops.          A U.S. defense official said that the 800 troops that returned to Fort Bragg were among the first to have deployed to Iraq shortly after Iranian-backed protesters stormed the outside perimeter of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.          \"The situation is more stable,\" said the defense official when asked why the troops were returning to the United States.          But the official noted that while U.S. military commanders continue to assess the Iranian threat situation in the region, it was determined that enabler units that might not be fully needed for the ongoing mission could be redeployed back to the United States.          \"The deployment of the Immediate Response Force (IRF) to the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) was a conditions-based process intended to provide additional defensive capabilities in support of U.S. forces and interests,\" said Maj. Rob Lodewick, a Pentagon spokesperson.          \"Re-deployment assessments and decisions regarding the IRF remain a similar conditions-based process,\" he added. \"As conditions in the theater continue to change, commanders constantly reassess force levels. As such, some elements of the IRF have re-deployed to their home stations in order to reset, train and re-assume their vital role in providing ready response options to contingency missions worldwide.\"          \"We could not be more proud of these Paratroopers and it is an honor to welcome them home,\" said Maj. Gen. James Mingus, the 82nd Airborne Division commanding general. \"These great men and women honored the tradition of Paratroopers that came before them by answering their Nation’s call on a moment’s notice.\"          While deployed to Kuwait the 2nd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment served as U.S. Central Command's Immediate Response Battalion and carried out realistic training in case they were needed elsewhere.          Designed to deploy anywhere in the world within 18 hours of receiving the orders, the Immediate Response Force Brigade's deployment in January was described as the most significant no-notice deployment of combat forces in 30 years.          Now, back at Fort Bragg, the unit will prepare for an upcoming exercise in Europe this spring known as Swift Response 20, the airborne portion of the larger annual Defender Europe 20 exercise that will involve other elements of the 82nd Airborne Division. This year's version of Defender Europe 20 will involve the largest deployment of U.S.-based troops to Europe for a military exercise in more than 25 years, a part of the strategic re-focus on Russia in the wake of Russia's military actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.\n",

      "Impeachment Fever Fuels Donald Trump Campaign Thunder\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As impeachment fever swept over D.C. last week, President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign shifted into battle mode, showing the president and his supporters what they could accomplish in the runup to the 2020 election.          Congressional Republicans in Washington found themselves calculating or critical of the president’s comments about China and Ukraine investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Critics of the president expressed surprise the White House did not employ a top-level messaging “war room” to fight back against the charges against the president and failed to deploy a round of surrogates to defend the president on cable news and on the Sunday shows.          But by the end of the week, it was clear the team leading the fight to defend the president was his re-election campaign, taking cues from Trump’s own combative messaging on Twitter and in person.          “The campaign gets bigger and stronger, and so does the President,” a campaign spokesperson told medianame News. “Every time Democrats and the media go into a feeding frenzy, the President’s re-election machine kicks into high gear.”          For years, the campaign invested heavily in campaign infrastructure, building up a team housed in an office building in Rosslyn, Virginia, but last week, they were able to surprise the establishment with a fundraising surge to demonstrate support for Trump.          Trump’s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised $15 million dollars in the 72 hours since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry — the same amount that former Vice President Joe Biden raised in the entire third quarter.          “Keep it up, Nancy. You’re helping us #KeepAmericaGreat,” Deputy Communications Director Erin Perrine wrote on Twitter.          The campaign immediately invested the money to defend the president, launching an $8.5 million ad campaign with multiple new ads targeting former Vice President Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and their allies in the establishment media in the early campaign states.          By the following Monday, the campaign trumpeted that their supporters were energized like never before as a result of Pelosi’s impeachment inquiry.          “This has the president’s supporters and also independents engaged and in the campaign and supporting President Trump in ways that they were not doing before to this level of intensity, and we have Nancy Pelosi and the impeachment inquiry to thank for that,” Trump’s campaign communications director, Tim Murtaugh, said during a call with reporters on Monday afternoon.          The contrast between Trump’s reelection campaign and former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign was stark.          Team Biden responded to the news with carefully constructed tweets, sent their candidate out with prepared remarks (leaked to the press early) and submitted a Washington Post op-ed to combat Trump’s accusation that Biden and his son Hunter Biden were corrupt. Biden and his campaign also inexplicably kept repeating they planned to “beat Trump like a drum.”          Trump’s campaign messaging imitated the president — nimble, red hot, and fighting mad.          The Trump social media war room spent the week engaging supporters on Twitter and Facebook, with a steady stream of content for Trump supporters to share, including a video of a “BullSchiff-o-meter” mocking “pencil neck” Adam Schiff, and targeted Pelosi, and Biden.          “Democrats know impeachment hurts the country…” the campaign wrote. “They just don’t care.”          “Since the day Donald Trump was elected, Democrats wanted to impeach him,” another video read. “President Trump’s only crime was beating Hillary Clinton in 2016!”          Another video mocked Pelosi stumbling over her words during a press conference where it was obvious that she was not pleased with how the impeachment inquiry was dominating the headlines.          The campaign also ramped up spending on digital ads — $2.1 million on Facebook and $500,000 on Google and YouTube last week, according to ACRONYM, a leftist nonprofit.          The campaign finished the week with positive messaging, touting the record low unemployment numbers released on Friday, pointing to the president’s success despite unprecedented opposition from Democrats.          Veterans of the 2016 campaign marveled at the well-funded, nimble operation that had been created for the president’s defense.          A former 2016 campaign aid told medianame News that the unique blend of the president’s messaging, Democrat attacks, and media criticism sparked moments where the campaign lit up on social media and fundraising. The impeachment efforts by Democrats, he said, was like rocket fuel for the president’s re-election campaign.          “I don’t think anything that the left did in 2016 has infuriated his supporters as much as this impeachment process has infuriated them,” he said.          Past moments energizing Trump supporters included the president’s campaign speech on immigration in Arizona and when he was criticized for saying that Obama had created ISIS, the former campaign staffer recalled.          Back then, Trump went to war on the campaign trail and on Twitter and the campaign did their best to amplify his message.          “People forget we were underfunded and understaffed in 2016,” he said. “Now they have a record amount of funding.”\n",
