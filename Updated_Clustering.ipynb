       "      <td>Would you rather have kids who are respectful of their elders, obedient, and well-behaved or children who are independent, curious, and self-reliant? Knowing what type of attitudes Americans would like their children to possess tells us more than you can imagine about their politics. Not only does it reveal their preferences about almost all the hot-button issues facing the country (race, immigration, gender equality, God, guns, terrorism, and more), it even structures their partisanship.          This development is new and it is important. Our research demonstrates that child-rearing priorities had little correlation with Americans’ partisan identities as recently as the 1990s. But in today’s world, where culture-war issues dominate the political landscape, child-rearing priorities and party are now tightly intertwined, making the partisan divide so deep and intense that it has become all but intractable. Moreover, these specific values are critically important to understanding voters beyond the US.          Over the past several years, candidates espousing right-wing populist views such as the virtues of nationalism, the perils of globalism, and distaste for immigrants have been flourishing in countries as diverse as Denmark, Germany, France, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Guatemala, and Peru.          This October, Jair Bolsonaro won a landslide victory in Brazil’s presidential election on a brazenly racist, sexist, and anti-LGBTQ platform with an affinity for law-and-order and nationalism. Meanwhile, Britain continues to march toward Brexit following the shocking referendum vote to leave the European Union two years ago.          The group of us are scholars from two separate research teams who have been studying the same thing: the rise of right-wing populism across the US, Europe, and Latin America. Although our two teams were not working in tandem, the two of us studying the US and Europe and the four of us working on Latin America uncovered the same pattern across three continents and myriad political circumstances: The qualities that citizens think are most important in children explain whether or not they voted for these right-wing populists.          Those who favor traditional characteristics like respect for elders, obedience, and good manners flock to them. Those who favor independence, self-reliance, and curiosity are repelled by them.          Why? Because these preferences help to reveal people’s worldviews — whether they think the world is a safe place to explore, or a dangerous place to protect oneself against.          How we think about raising kids is indicative of our politics          Across the US, Europe, and South America, we’ve surveyed tens of thousands of people of voting age over the past several years in dozens of countries, asking them about a wide range of topics concerning politics.          Among these questions was a set that, on the surface, appears to have nothing to do with politics at all: child-rearing values. We introduce the questions the same way in each country: “Although there are a number of qualities that people feel that children should have, every person thinks that some are more important than others.” We then asked them to choose what they valued most: respect for elders or independence; obedience or self-reliance; being well-behaved or being curious.          The Latin America research team revealed that only about 10 percent of those who favored independent, self-reliant, and curious kids voted for Bolsonaro during the first round election. Among Brazilians who favored respectful, obedient, and good-mannered kids, four times as many chose Bolsonaro.          Across Latin America in recent years, people who prefer obedient, disciplined children have voted consistently for right-wing populists such as Porfirio Lobo in Honduras and Otto Perez Molina in Guatemala.          In Germany, France, and Britain, the Europe/North America research team found the same pattern. Those who favored traditional qualities in children (respect, obedience, and good behavior) were about 30 percentage points more likely to vote for right-wing populist parties such as Germany’s Alternative for Germany, or AfD, and France’s National Front than those who favored more modern qualities (independence, self-reliance, and curiosity).          The gap was similar between “remain” and “leave” voters during Brexit. In the US, the difference was even larger — about 50 points when the choice was between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.          Those who prioritize order are more likely to value obedience in children          This relationship might seem at first like a random correlation, but it’s far from it. We believe that these child-rearing ideas capture people’s unreported worldviews — their deep-seated understanding of how the world works and what a good society ought to be. Throughout all human history, people have had worldviews. But they haven’t always been connected to politics like they are now in the US, and, increasingly, the rest of the world.          When the central focus of political conflict was economic — how much government ought to spend and how tightly it ought to regulate business, as it was in the US for most of the 20th century — this worldview did little to structure that conflict. There is no reason to think that how wary a person is about the dangers lurking in the world ought to have anything to do with how much they think the government ought to spend on highways or the merits they see in the free enterprise system.          As American party conflict shifted in the late 20th and early 21st century toward racial and gender equality, sexual orientation, immigration, various religious matters, and how best to remain safe from terrorism, the dividing lines changed. People’s deeply ingrained worldviews about the relative safety of these dramatic social changes and the world around us, in general, evolved into the key pivot between Republicans and Democrats.          The worldview of those who value traditional qualities in children is that the world is dangerous. It is best to keep children, and by extension society, on the straight and narrow. To them, the rapid political and cultural changes occurring around them — including increasing demographic diversity and sexual expression — pose a threat. They yearn for a simpler time, perhaps an imagined past, when life seemed more secure.          Their response is to try to impose order on their political system, much like parents might want to impose order on a chaotic household by emphasizing the qualities of respect, obedience, and good manners in children. Although a preference for traditional qualities in children is fine when managing a household — families, after all, are not democracies and children are not political citizens — imposing them on the political sphere is not entirely benign.          Those who prefer obedient, respectful children tend to be less concerned about bedrock democratic principles like free speech and a free press, which can, of course, produce disagreement. They are more open to a strongman leader who might not heed the legislature or judiciary, but who promises a more orderly society.          No matter where they pop up, right-wing populists use a core set of strategies that appeal to a worldview that desires order and predictability. They disparage challengers of traditional hierarchy, including women, racial and ethnic minorities, and LGBTQ people. They advocate granting police wide latitude to weaken social movements that could upset the status quo. And they highlight the potential perils of immigrants — outsiders — in the country.          What this means if we want to stop the rise of right-wing populism          We are, frankly, alarmed. Most citizens don’t want to live under authoritarian governments that rig or cancel elections. Few citizens clamor for military dictatorships. To use the most extreme example, Germans didn’t vote for Adolph Hitler because he promised to end democracy.          But when people feel like chaos is descending on their society and threats from the outside are ubiquitous, they are willing to turn a blind eye to growing authoritarianism in the interest of the instituting a more “orderly” society.          Democracy is inherently fragile. When right wing-populists find their way into office, the door is open to backsliding on the freedoms and protections of modern democracy as long as it’s done in the name of providing order or harkening back to a time that the country was great.          Charting a way forward in this tumultuous time will not be easy. This moment in history teaches us that democracy has always implicitly depended on political leaders hewing to democratic norms rather than sowing antagonism against society’s vulnerable for political gain and labeling press criticism as fake news.          The human condition is to value order — we see that in people’s parenting preferences, where most tend toward “traditional” parenting values. (Though a minority scored very high on traditional values — this was the group most likely to vote for right-wing populist candidates.) And, importantly, very few scored high on valuing “modern” qualities.          Because they like tidiness in their kids, they are going to like tidiness in the political sphere. Since this worldview is deeply ingrained in people, the public is unlikely to be the actor that protects the messiness inherent in democracy.          Hence leaders across the political spectrum need to recognize that they’re no longer dealing with politics as usual. The temptation to ignore democratic principles for electoral gain must be fought at all costs. A resolute commitment to addressing security needs while also respecting democratic principles, transparent government, and a real voice for ordinary people, Pollyanna though it might seem, remains the foundation for a politics capable of thwarting the temptations of authoritarianism and demonization.

       "      <td>On Tuesday, December 27, legendary actress Carrie Fisher, 60, was found dead, drowned in silver moonlight and strangled by her own brassiere.          That’s what Carrie Fisher wanted her obituary to say.          Fisher will always be known for playing Star Wars’ Princess Leia — now known as General Leia, as of the film franchise’s latest crop of movies. But that role paled in comparison to the person Fisher was offscreen: a fearless advocate for mental health, someone with a supernatural ability to make us smile, a gifted writer brimming with honesty and wit, and someone who wanted to be known for dying via underwear strangulation.          Star Wars was lucky to have Leia, and the world was lucky to have Fisher.          In her 2009 memoir Wishful Drinking, Fisher wrote about her difficult relationship with the Star Wars franchise. More specifically, she detailed Star Wars director George Lucas’s strange and perhaps sexist world building. Apparently in galaxies far, far, away, there was no such thing as female underwear:          George comes up to me the first day of filming and he takes one look at the dress and says, \"You can't wear a bra under that dress.\" So, I say, \"Okay, I'll bite. Why?\" And he says, \"Because ... there's no underwear in space.\" I promise you this is true, and he says it with such conviction too! Like he had been to space and looked around and didn’t see any bras or panties or briefs.          Lucas, she continues, eventually expanded on the idea (though it remains unclear why, if there’s no underwear in space, Leia only wears underwear when she’s on Tatooine, where she’s seen in the infamous “Slave Leia” gold bikini).          Lucas’s justification gave Fisher her own gleeful glorious idea, and the rest was history.          So fuck this heart attack. Here lies legendary actress, writer, and feminist Carrie Fisher, drowned in moonlight, strangled by her own bra.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Robert Trump, younger brother of President Trump, dies at 71</td>\n",
       "      <td>The endorsement of his brother and the prolonged period of silence seemed emblematic of Mr. Trump, who died Aug. 15 at 71 in New York City. The death was announced by the White House. He had been hospitalized for several days after becoming seriously ill. No cause of death was immediately given.          Robert Trump was the quiet one in comparison with his boisterous brother. He often did what his famous sibling asked him to do, absorbing the criticism that his brother reportedly lobbed at him and remaining loyal until the end of his life.          “It is with heavy heart I share that my wonderful brother, Robert, peacefully passed away tonight,” President Trump said in a statement. “He was not just my brother, he was my best friend. He will be greatly missed, but we will meet again. His memory will live on in my heart forever. Robert, I love you. Rest in peace.”          “Donald had discovered early on how easy it was to get under Robert’s pale skin and push him past his limits; it was a game he never tired of playing,” Mary Trump wrote. “Nobody else would have bothered — Robert was so skinny and quiet that there was no sport in tormenting him.”          That year, Steven Hyde, who oversaw Donald Trump’s Taj Mahal casino, was traveling on a helicopter with two other executives when the aircraft crashed in New Jersey, killing all onboard. Donald Trump had overextended himself in building the Taj Mahal casino and had relied heavily on Hyde. With Hyde’s death, Donald Trump asked Robert to oversee operations.          Because of mistakes for which Donald Trump bore at least some responsibility, including overestimating the demand for gambling, Robert Trump had difficulty stabilizing the finances of the Taj Mahal. In a meeting famously described by another former Trump casino executive, John O’Donnell, Donald Trump complained: “We’re going to lose a fortune.”          Donald Trump blew up at his brother, saying: “I’m sure as hell not going to listen to you in this situation. I listened to you and you got me into this,” according to O’Donnell. Robert Trump said, “I’m getting out of here. I don’t need this,” O’Donnell wrote.          In 1999, when Fred Trump Sr. died, his children faced a decision about how to handle the inheritance. Mary Trump and her brother, Fred Trump III, sought an amount similar to what would have gone to their father, Fred Trump Jr., had he lived. Because one of Fred Trump III’s children had cerebral palsy, he cited the need to pay for his son’s care in seeking his share of the inheritance.          Instead, Robert Trump worked on behalf of Donald Trump and his other siblings to give a much smaller amount to Mary and Fred Trump III. Robert Trump said in an affidavit that the health care for Fred III’s son had been provided “out of the goodness of our hearts,” and he said that Fred Trump III had received $200,000 annually from the Trump family “without lifting a finger.”          Years later, Mary Trump said she learned that the family had given her and her brother a much smaller inheritance in part by concealing how much the estate was worth. That revelation was part of the motivation for her to write her best-selling book about Donald Trump, “Too Much and Never Enough.”          Robert Trump, just as he had in the inheritance lawsuit, acted on behalf of Donald and other siblings in filing an action seeking to prevent publication of his niece’s book earlier this summer. Robert, who had been out of the public eye since his brother’s election to the White House, issued a statement in which he said he was “deeply disappointed” by Mary’s decision to write the book.          “I and the rest of my entire family are so proud of my wonderful brother, the president, and feel that Mary’s actions are truly a disgrace,” Robert Trump said in the statement. He did not speak publicly about the matter, continuing the near silence he had maintained throughout the presidency. A court allowed the book to be published and let Mary give interviews about it.          Robert Trump’s marriage to the former Blaine Beard, a socialite and philanthropist, ended in divorce. He had adopted her son Christopher from an earlier marriage. At the time of his divorce in 2008, the New York Post estimated Robert Trump’s fortune at $200 million.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Starting about 2000, and more frequently since 2017, researchers have documented large population declines among moths, beetles, bees, butterflies and many other insect types. If verified, this trend would be of serious concern, especially considering that insects are important animals in almost all terrestrial environments.          But in a newly published study that I co-wrote with 11 colleagues, we reviewed more than 5,000 sets of data on arthropods across North America, covering thousands of species and dozens of habitats over decades of time. We found, in essence, no change in population sizes.          These results don’t mean that insects are fine. Indeed, I believe there is good evidence that some species of insects are in decline and in danger of extinction. But our findings indicate that, overall, the idea of large-scale insect declines remains an open question.          Ecologist Bill Snyder and I thought that the studies suggesting widespread insect die-offs produced an intriguing pattern with important ramifications, but that the evidence wasn’t strong enough yet to draw conclusions. We wanted to examine what was happening in North America, which has an immensely diverse landscape and, surprisingly to us, had not been broadly analyzed for insect declines.          For our study, we decided to use data from sites in the Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER), which is supported by the National Science Foundation. The network includes 28 sites across the United States that have been studied in depth since the 1980s, and it covers deserts, mountains, prairies and forests. With almost 40 years of data collected, we hoped trends at these sites would be a good complement to European insect studies.          We put together a 12-person team that included six undergraduate students, postdoctoral scholars Michael Scott Crossley and Amanda Meier, and colleagues from the U.S. Agriculture Department. When we finished compiling our data sets, at least some of us expected to see broad insect declines.          Instead, the results left us perplexed. Some species we considered declined, while others increased. But by far the most common result for a species at a particular site was no significant change. The vast majority of our species had stable numbers.          At first, we thought we were missing something. We tried comparing different taxonomic groups, such as beetles and butterflies, and different types of feeding, such as herbivores and carnivores. We tried comparing urban, agricultural and relatively undisturbed areas. We tried comparing different habitats and different periods of time.          But the answer remained the same: no change. We had to conclude that at the sites we examined, there were no signs of an insect apocalypse and, in reality, no broad declines at all.          We are confident in our analysis and our conclusion, but a more important question is why our results are so different from those of other recent studies. I see two potential explanations: location and publication bias.          As I have noted, most insect decline papers have come from European data. Indeed, Europe has better and more extensive long-term data than other parts of the world. It is also one of the most densely populated parts of the world — three times higher than North America.          Moreover, almost all of Europe’s land has been modified for human use. Agriculture is widespread and intense, and cities and suburban areas cover large swaths of the landscape. So perhaps it is unsurprising that Europe has also lost a larger proportion of its wild creatures compared to North America.          Publication bias is not about dishonesty or false results. It refers to the idea that more dramatic results are more publishable. Reviewers and journals are more likely to be interested in species that are disappearing than in species that show no change over time.          We selected LTER sites for our analysis in part because they had “raw” data available that had not been peer reviewed for publication and were not collected in anticipation of finding declines. Rather, scientists amassed these data to monitor ecosystems and observe trends over time. In other words, it was unbiased data. And because the data sets were so varied, they covered a broad range of species and habitats.          Our study will not be the final answer. As the human population continues to grow and appropriates an ever larger share of the world’s land, water, space and biomass, other species can only retreat and survive with fewer resources. I have no doubt that every time a forest is cut, a prairie is plowed or a field is paved, the world loses some of its animal and plant life.          Quantifying this process will require more monitoring, more conservation biologists working in the field and more awareness of how human actions affect Earth’s biodiversity. But it may be possible that insects, which have survived for millions of years through a great many biological catastrophes, are finding a way to survive our presence, too.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cracks in the typically close relations between Belarus and Russia started late last year, after Lukashenko resisted the Kremlin’s push for the two countries to form a unified state — something they agreed to in 1999. Moscow attempted to use its longtime deal to sell Minsk discounted oil as leverage, so when the two countries failed in December to agree on a new price, Russia temporarily cut the supply.          Lukashenko’s negative rhetoric toward Russia increased after that — for example, he lashed out at a Russian state television journalist’s criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Then in the weeks leading up to the elections, Lukashenko hinted at a Russian plot to oust him, even arresting more than 30 Russian men who the Belarusan government said were mercenaries from the shadowy Russian paramilitary Wagner outfit.          Lukashenko alleged that the men had been sent to Belarus to destabilize the country, but security analysts have said it’s likely they were using Minsk as a transit hub to Africa — a common practice that would have been cleared with authorities in Belarus. In what appeared to be a gesture to Moscow, the alleged mercenaries were released on Friday.          Valery Tsepkalo, a prominent opposition figure who left Belarus after he was barred from running in the election, said Lukashenko was “bluffing” about the mercenaries and is doing the same now with suggestions of Russia potentially intervening militarily on his behalf.          With Lukashenko denouncing the recent protests as being driven by foreign actors and adding in comments Sunday that “NATO troops are crawling near our gates,” there’s been speculation that he could attempt to spin that as the external threat that would justify support from Russia.          “There is no military intervention from the side of anyone,” Tsepkalo said. “There is no reason [for Russia] to intervene. I don’t think it will happen.”          Artyom Shraibman of Sense Analytics, a Minsk-based political consultancy, said fear of Russian action has been one thing uniting both the regime and the opposition over the past week. Russia’s annexation of Crimea, after all, came in the aftermath of Ukraine’s Maidan revolution, which ousted the country’s pro-Russian then-president.          “It’s unclear how Russia would behave, but I would say true military-style occupation would be overwhelmingly costly in these circumstances because Belarus isn’t Crimea,” he added. “Belarusans do not want to be part of Russia or occupied by Russia, so there would be a lot of blood. And trying to reinforce authorities that are domestically weak is also a tough sell.”          Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of Russian propaganda outlet RT, wrote on Twitter on Friday that, “You know, it’s about time for polite people to restore order as only they know how,” with “polite people” a reference to the Russian soldiers dispatched to Crimea six years ago.          But Moscow doesn’t automatically act in response to all revolutions along its border; it stayed out of Armenia’s in 2018 and Kyrgyzstan’s in 2010 in part because, like this movement in Belarus, there were no signs of anti-Kremlin sentiment among the protesters or the opposition’s leaders.          Lukashenko, who at 65 is two years younger than Putin, described his Russian counterpart as like “an older brother” just three days before the elections, perhaps anticipating that the greatest challenge to his 26-year reign was ahead.</td>\n",

       "0  Would you rather have kids who are respectful of their elders, obedient, and well-behaved or children who are independent, curious, and self-reliant? Knowing what type of attitudes Americans would like their children to possess tells us more than you can imagine about their politics. Not only does it reveal their preferences about almost all the hot-button issues facing the country (race, immigration, gender equality, God, guns, terrorism, and more), it even structures their partisanship.          This development is new and it is important. Our research demonstrates that child-rearing priorities had little correlation with Americans’ partisan identities as recently as the 1990s. But in today’s world, where culture-war issues dominate the political landscape, child-rearing priorities and party are now tightly intertwined, making the partisan divide so deep and intense that it has become all but intractable. Moreover, these specific values are critically important to understanding voters beyond the US.          Over the past several years, candidates espousing right-wing populist views such as the virtues of nationalism, the perils of globalism, and distaste for immigrants have been flourishing in countries as diverse as Denmark, Germany, France, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Guatemala, and Peru.          This October, Jair Bolsonaro won a landslide victory in Brazil’s presidential election on a brazenly racist, sexist, and anti-LGBTQ platform with an affinity for law-and-order and nationalism. Meanwhile, Britain continues to march toward Brexit following the shocking referendum vote to leave the European Union two years ago.          The group of us are scholars from two separate research teams who have been studying the same thing: the rise of right-wing populism across the US, Europe, and Latin America. Although our two teams were not working in tandem, the two of us studying the US and Europe and the four of us working on Latin America uncovered the same pattern across three continents and myriad political circumstances: The qualities that citizens think are most important in children explain whether or not they voted for these right-wing populists.          Those who favor traditional characteristics like respect for elders, obedience, and good manners flock to them. Those who favor independence, self-reliance, and curiosity are repelled by them.          Why? Because these preferences help to reveal people’s worldviews — whether they think the world is a safe place to explore, or a dangerous place to protect oneself against.          How we think about raising kids is indicative of our politics          Across the US, Europe, and South America, we’ve surveyed tens of thousands of people of voting age over the past several years in dozens of countries, asking them about a wide range of topics concerning politics.          Among these questions was a set that, on the surface, appears to have nothing to do with politics at all: child-rearing values. We introduce the questions the same way in each country: “Although there are a number of qualities that people feel that children should have, every person thinks that some are more important than others.” We then asked them to choose what they valued most: respect for elders or independence; obedience or self-reliance; being well-behaved or being curious.          The Latin America research team revealed that only about 10 percent of those who favored independent, self-reliant, and curious kids voted for Bolsonaro during the first round election. Among Brazilians who favored respectful, obedient, and good-mannered kids, four times as many chose Bolsonaro.          Across Latin America in recent years, people who prefer obedient, disciplined children have voted consistently for right-wing populists such as Porfirio Lobo in Honduras and Otto Perez Molina in Guatemala.          In Germany, France, and Britain, the Europe/North America research team found the same pattern. Those who favored traditional qualities in children (respect, obedience, and good behavior) were about 30 percentage points more likely to vote for right-wing populist parties such as Germany’s Alternative for Germany, or AfD, and France’s National Front than those who favored more modern qualities (independence, self-reliance, and curiosity).          The gap was similar between “remain” and “leave” voters during Brexit. In the US, the difference was even larger — about 50 points when the choice was between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.          Those who prioritize order are more likely to value obedience in children          This relationship might seem at first like a random correlation, but it’s far from it. We believe that these child-rearing ideas capture people’s unreported worldviews — their deep-seated understanding of how the world works and what a good society ought to be. Throughout all human history, people have had worldviews. But they haven’t always been connected to politics like they are now in the US, and, increasingly, the rest of the world.          When the central focus of political conflict was economic — how much government ought to spend and how tightly it ought to regulate business, as it was in the US for most of the 20th century — this worldview did little to structure that conflict. There is no reason to think that how wary a person is about the dangers lurking in the world ought to have anything to do with how much they think the government ought to spend on highways or the merits they see in the free enterprise system.          As American party conflict shifted in the late 20th and early 21st century toward racial and gender equality, sexual orientation, immigration, various religious matters, and how best to remain safe from terrorism, the dividing lines changed. People’s deeply ingrained worldviews about the relative safety of these dramatic social changes and the world around us, in general, evolved into the key pivot between Republicans and Democrats.          The worldview of those who value traditional qualities in children is that the world is dangerous. It is best to keep children, and by extension society, on the straight and narrow. To them, the rapid political and cultural changes occurring around them — including increasing demographic diversity and sexual expression — pose a threat. They yearn for a simpler time, perhaps an imagined past, when life seemed more secure.          Their response is to try to impose order on their political system, much like parents might want to impose order on a chaotic household by emphasizing the qualities of respect, obedience, and good manners in children. Although a preference for traditional qualities in children is fine when managing a household — families, after all, are not democracies and children are not political citizens — imposing them on the political sphere is not entirely benign.          Those who prefer obedient, respectful children tend to be less concerned about bedrock democratic principles like free speech and a free press, which can, of course, produce disagreement. They are more open to a strongman leader who might not heed the legislature or judiciary, but who promises a more orderly society.          No matter where they pop up, right-wing populists use a core set of strategies that appeal to a worldview that desires order and predictability. They disparage challengers of traditional hierarchy, including women, racial and ethnic minorities, and LGBTQ people. They advocate granting police wide latitude to weaken social movements that could upset the status quo. And they highlight the potential perils of immigrants — outsiders — in the country.          What this means if we want to stop the rise of right-wing populism          We are, frankly, alarmed. Most citizens don’t want to live under authoritarian governments that rig or cancel elections. Few citizens clamor for military dictatorships. To use the most extreme example, Germans didn’t vote for Adolph Hitler because he promised to end democracy.          But when people feel like chaos is descending on their society and threats from the outside are ubiquitous, they are willing to turn a blind eye to growing authoritarianism in the interest of the instituting a more “orderly” society.          Democracy is inherently fragile. When right wing-populists find their way into office, the door is open to backsliding on the freedoms and protections of modern democracy as long as it’s done in the name of providing order or harkening back to a time that the country was great.          Charting a way forward in this tumultuous time will not be easy. This moment in history teaches us that democracy has always implicitly depended on political leaders hewing to democratic norms rather than sowing antagonism against society’s vulnerable for political gain and labeling press criticism as fake news.          The human condition is to value order — we see that in people’s parenting preferences, where most tend toward “traditional” parenting values. (Though a minority scored very high on traditional values — this was the group most likely to vote for right-wing populist candidates.) And, importantly, very few scored high on valuing “modern” qualities.          Because they like tidiness in their kids, they are going to like tidiness in the political sphere. Since this worldview is deeply ingrained in people, the public is unlikely to be the actor that protects the messiness inherent in democracy.          Hence leaders across the political spectrum need to recognize that they’re no longer dealing with politics as usual. The temptation to ignore democratic principles for electoral gain must be fought at all costs. A resolute commitment to addressing security needs while also respecting democratic principles, transparent government, and a real voice for ordinary people, Pollyanna though it might seem, remains the foundation for a politics capable of thwarting the temptations of authoritarianism and demonization.

her own brassiere.          That’s what Carrie Fisher wanted her obituary to say.          Fisher will always be known for playing Star Wars’ Princess Leia — now known as General Leia, as of the film franchise’s latest crop of movies. But that role paled in comparison to the person Fisher was offscreen: a fearless advocate for mental health, someone with a supernatural ability to make us smile, a gifted writer brimming with honesty and wit, and someone who wanted to be known for dying via underwear strangulation.          Star Wars was lucky to have Leia, and the world was lucky to have Fisher.          In her 2009 memoir Wishful Drinking, Fisher wrote about her difficult relationship with the Star Wars franchise. More specifically, she detailed Star Wars director George Lucas’s strange and perhaps sexist world building. Apparently in galaxies far, far, away, there was no such thing as female underwear:          George comes up to me the first day of filming and he takes one look at the dress and says, \"You can't wear a bra under that dress.\" So, I say, \"Okay, I'll bite. Why?\" And he says, \"Because ... there's no underwear in space.\" I promise you this is true, and he says it with such conviction too! Like he had been to space and looked around and didn’t see any bras or panties or briefs.          Lucas, she continues, eventually expanded on the idea (though it remains unclear why, if there’s no underwear in space, Leia only wears underwear when she’s on Tatooine, where she’s seen in the infamous “Slave Leia” gold bikini).          Lucas’s justification gave Fisher her own gleeful glorious idea, and the rest was history.          So fuck this heart attack. Here lies legendary actress, writer, and feminist Carrie Fisher, drowned in moonlight, strangled by her own bra.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The endorsement of his brother and the prolonged period of silence seemed emblematic of Mr. Trump, who died Aug. 15 at 71 in New York City. The death was announced by the White House. He had been hospitalized for several days after becoming seriously ill. No cause of death was immediately given.          Robert Trump was the quiet one in comparison with his boisterous brother. He often did what his famous sibling asked him to do, absorbing the criticism that his brother reportedly lobbed at him and remaining loyal until the end of his life.          “It is with heavy heart I share that my wonderful brother, Robert, peacefully passed away tonight,” President Trump said in a statement. “He was not just my brother, he was my best friend. He will be greatly missed, but we will meet again. His memory will live on in my heart forever. Robert, I love you. Rest in peace.”          “Donald had discovered early on how easy it was to get under Robert’s pale skin and push him past his limits; it was a game he never tired of playing,” Mary Trump wrote. “Nobody else would have bothered — Robert was so skinny and quiet that there was no sport in tormenting him.”          That year, Steven Hyde, who oversaw Donald Trump’s Taj Mahal casino, was traveling on a helicopter with two other executives when the aircraft crashed in New Jersey, killing all onboard. Donald Trump had overextended himself in building the Taj Mahal casino and had relied heavily on Hyde. With Hyde’s death, Donald Trump asked Robert to oversee operations.          Because of mistakes for which Donald Trump bore at least some responsibility, including overestimating the demand for gambling, Robert Trump had difficulty stabilizing the finances of the Taj Mahal. In a meeting famously described by another former Trump casino executive, John O’Donnell, Donald Trump complained: “We’re going to lose a fortune.”          Donald Trump blew up at his brother, saying: “I’m sure as hell not going to listen to you in this situation. I listened to you and you got me into this,” according to O’Donnell. Robert Trump said, “I’m getting out of here. I don’t need this,” O’Donnell wrote.          In 1999, when Fred Trump Sr. died, his children faced a decision about how to handle the inheritance. Mary Trump and her brother, Fred Trump III, sought an amount similar to what would have gone to their father, Fred Trump Jr., had he lived. Because one of Fred Trump III’s children had cerebral palsy, he cited the need to pay for his son’s care in seeking his share of the inheritance.          Instead, Robert Trump worked on behalf of Donald Trump and his other siblings to give a much smaller amount to Mary and Fred Trump III. Robert Trump said in an affidavit that the health care for Fred III’s son had been provided “out of the goodness of our hearts,” and he said that Fred Trump III had received $200,000 annually from the Trump family “without lifting a finger.”          Years later, Mary Trump said she learned that the family had given her and her brother a much smaller inheritance in part by concealing how much the estate was worth. That revelation was part of the motivation for her to write her best-selling book about Donald Trump, “Too Much and Never Enough.”          Robert Trump, just as he had in the inheritance lawsuit, acted on behalf of Donald and other siblings in filing an action seeking to prevent publication of his niece’s book earlier this summer. Robert, who had been out of the public eye since his brother’s election to the White House, issued a statement in which he said he was “deeply disappointed” by Mary’s decision to write the book.          “I and the rest of my entire family are so proud of my wonderful brother, the president, and feel that Mary’s actions are truly a disgrace,” Robert Trump said in the statement. He did not speak publicly about the matter, continuing the near silence he had maintained throughout the presidency. A court allowed the book to be published and let Mary give interviews about it.          Robert Trump’s marriage to the former Blaine Beard, a socialite and philanthropist, ended in divorce. He had adopted her son Christopher from an earlier marriage. At the time of his divorce in 2008, the New York Post estimated Robert Trump’s fortune at $200 million.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Starting about 2000, and more frequently since 2017, researchers have documented large population declines among moths, beetles, bees, butterflies and many other insect types. If verified, this trend would be of serious concern, especially considering that insects are important animals in almost all terrestrial environments.          But in a newly published study that I co-wrote with 11 colleagues, we reviewed more than 5,000 sets of data on arthropods across North America, covering thousands of species and dozens of habitats over decades of time. We found, in essence, no change in population sizes.          These results don’t mean that insects are fine. Indeed, I believe there is good evidence that some species of insects are in decline and in danger of extinction. But our findings indicate that, overall, the idea of large-scale insect declines remains an open question.          Ecologist Bill Snyder and I thought that the studies suggesting widespread insect die-offs produced an intriguing pattern with important ramifications, but that the evidence wasn’t strong enough yet to draw conclusions. We wanted to examine what was happening in North America, which has an immensely diverse landscape and, surprisingly to us, had not been broadly analyzed for insect declines.          For our study, we decided to use data from sites in the Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER), which is supported by the National Science Foundation. The network includes 28 sites across the United States that have been studied in depth since the 1980s, and it covers deserts, mountains, prairies and forests. With almost 40 years of data collected, we hoped trends at these sites would be a good complement to European insect studies.          We put together a 12-person team that included six undergraduate students, postdoctoral scholars Michael Scott Crossley and Amanda Meier, and colleagues from the U.S. Agriculture Department. When we finished compiling our data sets, at least some of us expected to see broad insect declines.          Instead, the results left us perplexed. Some species we considered declined, while others increased. But by far the most common result for a species at a particular site was no significant change. The vast majority of our species had stable numbers.          At first, we thought we were missing something. We tried comparing different taxonomic groups, such as beetles and butterflies, and different types of feeding, such as herbivores and carnivores. We tried comparing urban, agricultural and relatively undisturbed areas. We tried comparing different habitats and different periods of time.          But the answer remained the same: no change. We had to conclude that at the sites we examined, there were no signs of an insect apocalypse and, in reality, no broad declines at all.          We are confident in our analysis and our conclusion, but a more important question is why our results are so different from those of other recent studies. I see two potential explanations: location and publication bias.          As I have noted, most insect decline papers have come from European data. Indeed, Europe has better and more extensive long-term data than other parts of the world. It is also one of the most densely populated parts of the world — three times higher than North America.          Moreover, almost all of Europe’s land has been modified for human use. Agriculture is widespread and intense, and cities and suburban areas cover large swaths of the landscape. So perhaps it is unsurprising that Europe has also lost a larger proportion of its wild creatures compared to North America.          Publication bias is not about dishonesty or false results. It refers to the idea that more dramatic results are more publishable. Reviewers and journals are more likely to be interested in species that are disappearing than in species that show no change over time.          We selected LTER sites for our analysis in part because they had “raw” data available that had not been peer reviewed for publication and were not collected in anticipation of finding declines. Rather, scientists amassed these data to monitor ecosystems and observe trends over time. In other words, it was unbiased data. And because the data sets were so varied, they covered a broad range of species and habitats.          Our study will not be the final answer. As the human population continues to grow and appropriates an ever larger share of the world’s land, water, space and biomass, other species can only retreat and survive with fewer resources. I have no doubt that every time a forest is cut, a prairie is plowed or a field is paved, the world loses some of its animal and plant life.          Quantifying this process will require more monitoring, more conservation biologists working in the field and more awareness of how human actions affect Earth’s biodiversity. But it may be possible that insects, which have survived for millions of years through a great many biological catastrophes, are finding a way to survive our presence, too.   \n",

                                                                                                             Cracks in the typically close relations between Belarus and Russia started late last year, after Lukashenko resisted the Kremlin’s push for the two countries to form a unified state — something they agreed to in 1999. Moscow attempted to use its longtime deal to sell Minsk discounted oil as leverage, so when the two countries failed in December to agree on a new price, Russia temporarily cut the supply.          Lukashenko’s negative rhetoric toward Russia increased after that — for example, he lashed out at a Russian state television journalist’s criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Then in the weeks leading up to the elections, Lukashenko hinted at a Russian plot to oust him, even arresting more than 30 Russian men who the Belarusan government said were mercenaries from the shadowy Russian paramilitary Wagner outfit.          Lukashenko alleged that the men had been sent to Belarus to destabilize the country, but security analysts have said it’s likely they were using Minsk as a transit hub to Africa — a common practice that would have been cleared with authorities in Belarus. In what appeared to be a gesture to Moscow, the alleged mercenaries were released on Friday.          Valery Tsepkalo, a prominent opposition figure who left Belarus after he was barred from running in the election, said Lukashenko was “bluffing” about the mercenaries and is doing the same now with suggestions of Russia potentially intervening militarily on his behalf.          With Lukashenko denouncing the recent protests as being driven by foreign actors and adding in comments Sunday that “NATO troops are crawling near our gates,” there’s been speculation that he could attempt to spin that as the external threat that would justify support from Russia.          “There is no military intervention from the side of anyone,” Tsepkalo said. “There is no reason [for Russia] to intervene. I don’t think it will happen.”          Artyom Shraibman of Sense Analytics, a Minsk-based political consultancy, said fear of Russian action has been one thing uniting both the regime and the opposition over the past week. Russia’s annexation of Crimea, after all, came in the aftermath of Ukraine’s Maidan revolution, which ousted the country’s pro-Russian then-president.          “It’s unclear how Russia would behave, but I would say true military-style occupation would be overwhelmingly costly in these circumstances because Belarus isn’t Crimea,” he added. “Belarusans do not want to be part of Russia or occupied by Russia, so there would be a lot of blood. And trying to reinforce authorities that are domestically weak is also a tough sell.”          Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of Russian propaganda outlet RT, wrote on Twitter on Friday that, “You know, it’s about time for polite people to restore order as only they know how,” with “polite people” a reference to the Russian soldiers dispatched to Crimea six years ago.          But Moscow doesn’t automatically act in response to all revolutions along its border; it stayed out of Armenia’s in 2018 and Kyrgyzstan’s in 2010 in part because, like this movement in Belarus, there were no signs of anti-Kremlin sentiment among the protesters or the opposition’s leaders.          Lukashenko, who at 65 is two years younger than Putin, described his Russian counterpart as like “an older brother” just three days before the elections, perhaps anticipating that the greatest challenge to his 26-year reign was ahead.   \n",

       "      <td>(medianame) America's most senior general warned that \"divisiveness leads to defeat\" in a speech to Naval War College graduates on Wednesday.          Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley counseled the audience to \"eliminate anything that divides us.\"          While he also spoke of the traditional need to keep an eye on adversaries \"during periods when we are weary from conflict or otherwise preoccupied,\" and did not mention President Donald Trump by name, his comments appeared to address the broader backdrop of racial divisiveness in the country and concerns within the Pentagon about the military becoming politicized.          Milley told the students, \"We who wear the cloth of our nation must hold dear the principle of an apolitical military that is so deeply rooted in the very essence of our Republic.\"          His speech followed Defense Secretary Mark Esper's announcement of a major review last week aimed at improving diversity and \"ensuring equal opportunity across all ranks\" of the US military.          The Pentagon effort to address racism and promote equality, even as leaders try to avoid White House politics, has been notable and follows Milley's extraordinary apology for appearing in a photo-op with Trump after the forceful dispersal of peaceful protesters outside the White House earlier this month.          Esper similarly acknowledged the problematic nature of his own appearance and later told reporters he did not want to see active duty forces on the streets of Washington, DC -- a statement that increased tensions between the Pentagon and the White House.          Several current defense officials with access to both men say the two are deeply concerned about Trump attempting to politicize the military and potentially dragging the forces into the presidential election campaign.          \"Both realize over the last month that the Defense Department has been overexposed and politicized\" a senior administration official said, blaming both the White House and Democrats.          While there are always political tensions as an election looms, Trump has done little to assure Esper or Milley of his unqualified support for them. In an interview with Axios , Trump said Esper and Milley should have been \"proud\" to be with in the photo-op.          Esper has repeatedly let it be known he thought Trump might fire him and he had also prepared a letter of resignation earlier this month. Similarly, Milley consulted a number of senior retired and military officers to seek their advice on whether he could continue effectively in the role, according to officials with direct knowledge.          While Milley has made two speeches to military audiences, and Esper has visited some military bases, neither of them has engaged publicly or answered questions from the press in recent weeks.          On Wednesday, Esper departed for meetings at NATO in Brussels, in part to discuss Trump's orders to remove 10,000 troops from Germany , something the Pentagon is not anxious to do in the face of Russian aggression in eastern Europe. That trip is expected to be very low key with Esper currently not scheduled to speak publicly.          However, Esper and Milley may not be able to avoid tough questions for long.          There are tentative plans for them to testify before the House Armed Services Committee just after the July 4 recess about the use of National Guard troops and the calling up of active duty forces during the recent protests prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.          That hearing could be the first time the brewing tensions between the Pentagon and the White House are brought clearly into the public view.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Department of Homeland Security created a fake university that it touted as ‘authorized to enroll international students’. Photograph: Alamy US immigration How the US government created a fake university to snare immigrant students Court documents reveal stunning scheme used to trap 161 foreign nationals; Ice maintains the students knew the school was fake          The University of Farmington website described a college that would prepare students to succeed in an “ever-globalizing economy”. Students would show up at campus wearing backpacks and asking questions about classes. The US government listed Farmington as eligible to enroll foreign students. The school president, whose LinkedIn page is still online, sent emails to students describing his institution as “a nationally accredited institution authorized to enroll international students”.          Court documents unsealed last month unveiled a stunning scheme by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to create a fake university – with no classes or professors, just a staff of undercover agents who went on to build a case that has seen 161 foreign nationals arrested.          “These are students who are trying to make their lives better, these are not criminals, these are not people who are here leeching off the system,” said Amer Zahr, an adjunct professor of law at the University of Detroit-Mercy and a spokesman for Najlaa Krim Musarsa, one of the students arrested.          Musarsa, a 29-year-old woman from Palestine, was one of those arrested without trial for civil immigration violations because she enrolled in the university, located just outside of Detroit in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Eight other people were charged with criminal violations and are accused of helping enroll the students in exchange for cash, kickbacks and tuition credits from February 2017 to January 2019.          “Everyone was taken completely by surprise,” Zahr said. “There was no warning of this action. There was no notice given to her [Musarsa] that she was out of status, that this university was fake.”          Most of the students were Indian and the country’s government issued a rare “démarche” to the US embassy in New Delhi stating the government needed immediate access to the detainees. As of 5 February, India consular officials had visited 36 different detention centers across the US and created a 24/7 hotline for impacted students.          Since the indictment was unsealed on 30 January, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has maintained each of the more than 600 people enrolled at the University of Farmington knew they would not attend real classes or earn credits. “Their intent was to fraudulently maintain their student visa status and to obtain work authorization,” the indictment said.          Faiza Patel, the codirector of the liberty and national security program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said it was not 100% clear that every student knew what they were getting into.          “It’s an open question as to whether this is the best use of Ice’s resources,” Patel said. “I think these days we have a lot of open questions about whether the way Ice is responding is a logical response to the problems this country faces.”          At the University of Farmington, federal agents posed as school officials in emails and registered the school with the state of Michigan, according to emails obtained by the Detroit Free Press. Workers at the building listed as University of Farmington’s location told local news channel WXYZ that students would come in asking what time the school opened and closed and complained they had trouble getting in touch with school representatives.          The undercover operation was led by the nation’s second largest investigative agency, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which is one of the three branches of Ice. A 2008 Ice handbook leaked last year showed that while undercover agents are advised not to induce people to commit crimes, exceptions can be made and are internally regulated.          This is not the first sham university created by Ice. In 2016, the agency announced the University of Northern New Jersey was not a legitimate school and its only employees were undercover agents. Then, too, the government insisted the more than 1,000 students were aware they were participating in a fraud. About 20 brokers were also arrested for recruiting students.          Angelo Guisado, the staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said DHS carried out the operation aware that it could send hundreds of people to immigration courts, which do not have the same constitutional protections as other courts.          “Ice knowing this or DHS knowing this tries to ensnare as many people as possible and get them wound up in an immigration system where they know that the cards are going to be stacked against the immigrant,” Guisado said.</td>\n",

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley counseled the audience to \"eliminate anything that divides us.\"          While he also spoke of the traditional need to keep an eye on adversaries \"during periods when we are weary from conflict or otherwise preoccupied,\" and did not mention President Donald Trump by name, his comments appeared to address the broader backdrop of racial divisiveness in the country and concerns within the Pentagon about the military becoming politicized.          Milley told the students, \"We who wear the cloth of our nation must hold dear the principle of an apolitical military that is so deeply rooted in the very essence of our Republic.\"          His speech followed Defense Secretary Mark Esper's announcement of a major review last week aimed at improving diversity and \"ensuring equal opportunity across all ranks\" of the US military.          The Pentagon effort to address racism and promote equality, even as leaders try to avoid White House politics, has been notable and follows Milley's extraordinary apology for appearing in a photo-op with Trump after the forceful dispersal of peaceful protesters outside the White House earlier this month.          Esper similarly acknowledged the problematic nature of his own appearance and later told reporters he did not want to see active duty forces on the streets of Washington, DC -- a statement that increased tensions between the Pentagon and the White House.          Several current defense officials with access to both men say the two are deeply concerned about Trump attempting to politicize the military and potentially dragging the forces into the presidential election campaign.          \"Both realize over the last month that the Defense Department has been overexposed and politicized\" a senior administration official said, blaming both the White House and Democrats.          While there are always political tensions as an election looms, Trump has done little to assure Esper or Milley of his unqualified support for them. In an interview with Axios , Trump said Esper and Milley should have been \"proud\" to be with in the photo-op.          Esper has repeatedly let it be known he thought Trump might fire him and he had also prepared a letter of resignation earlier this month. Similarly, Milley consulted a number of senior retired and military officers to seek their advice on whether he could continue effectively in the role, according to officials with direct knowledge.          While Milley has made two speeches to military audiences, and Esper has visited some military bases, neither of them has engaged publicly or answered questions from the press in recent weeks.          On Wednesday, Esper departed for meetings at NATO in Brussels, in part to discuss Trump's orders to remove 10,000 troops from Germany , something the Pentagon is not anxious to do in the face of Russian aggression in eastern Europe. That trip is expected to be very low key with Esper currently not scheduled to speak publicly.          However, Esper and Milley may not be able to avoid tough questions for long.          There are tentative plans for them to testify before the House Armed Services Committee just after the July 4 recess about the use of National Guard troops and the calling up of active duty forces during the recent protests prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.          That hearing could be the first time the brewing tensions between the Pentagon and the White House are brought clearly into the public view.   \n",
       "1  The Department of Homeland Security created a fake university that it touted as ‘authorized to enroll international students’. Photograph: Alamy US immigration How the US government created a fake university to snare immigrant students Court documents reveal stunning scheme used to trap 161 foreign nationals; Ice maintains the students knew the school was fake          The University of Farmington website described a college that would prepare students to succeed in an “ever-globalizing economy”. Students would show up at campus wearing backpacks and asking questions about classes. The US government listed Farmington as eligible to enroll foreign students. The school president, whose LinkedIn page is still online, sent emails to students describing his institution as “a nationally accredited institution authorized to enroll international students”.          Court documents unsealed last month unveiled a stunning scheme by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to create a fake university – with no classes or professors, just a staff of undercover agents who went on to build a case that has seen 161 foreign nationals arrested.          “These are students who are trying to make their lives better, these are not criminals, these are not people who are here leeching off the system,” said Amer Zahr, an adjunct professor of law at the University of Detroit-Mercy and a spokesman for Najlaa Krim Musarsa, one of the students arrested.          Musarsa, a 29-year-old woman from Palestine, was one of those arrested without trial for civil immigration violations because she enrolled in the university, located just outside of Detroit in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Eight other people were charged with criminal violations and are accused of helping enroll the students in exchange for cash, kickbacks and tuition credits from February 2017 to January 2019.          “Everyone was taken completely by surprise,” Zahr said. “There was no warning of this action. There was no notice given to her [Musarsa] that she was out of status, that this university was fake.”          Most of the students were Indian and the country’s government issued a rare “démarche” to the US embassy in New Delhi stating the government needed immediate access to the detainees. As of 5 February, India consular officials had visited 36 different detention centers across the US and created a 24/7 hotline for impacted students.          Since the indictment was unsealed on 30 January, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has maintained each of the more than 600 people enrolled at the University of Farmington knew they would not attend real classes or earn credits. “Their intent was to fraudulently maintain their student visa status and to obtain work authorization,” the indictment said.          Faiza Patel, the codirector of the liberty and national security program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said it was not 100% clear that every student knew what they were getting into.          “It’s an open question as to whether this is the best use of Ice’s resources,” Patel said. “I think these days we have a lot of open questions about whether the way Ice is responding is a logical response to the problems this country faces.”          At the University of Farmington, federal agents posed as school officials in emails and registered the school with the state of Michigan, according to emails obtained by the Detroit Free Press. Workers at the building listed as University of Farmington’s location told local news channel WXYZ that students would come in asking what time the school opened and closed and complained they had trouble getting in touch with school representatives.          The undercover operation was led by the nation’s second largest investigative agency, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which is one of the three branches of Ice. A 2008 Ice handbook leaked last year showed that while undercover agents are advised not to induce people to commit crimes, exceptions can be made and are internally regulated.          This is not the first sham university created by Ice. In 2016, the agency announced the University of Northern New Jersey was not a legitimate school and its only employees were undercover agents. Then, too, the government insisted the more than 1,000 students were aware they were participating in a fraud. About 20 brokers were also arrested for recruiting students.          Angelo Guisado, the staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said DHS carried out the operation aware that it could send hundreds of people to immigration courts, which do not have the same constitutional protections as other courts.          “Ice knowing this or DHS knowing this tries to ensnare as many people as possible and get them wound up in an immigration system where they know that the cards are going to be stacked against the immigrant,” Guisado said.   \n",

       "      <td>(medianame) America's most senior general warned that \"divisiveness leads to defeat\" in a speech to Naval War College graduates on Wednesday.          Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley counseled the audience to \"eliminate anything that divides us.\"          While he also spoke of the traditional need to keep an eye on adversaries \"during periods when we are weary from conflict or otherwise preoccupied,\" and did not mention President Donald Trump by name, his comments appeared to address the broader backdrop of racial divisiveness in the country and concerns within the Pentagon about the military becoming politicized.          Milley told the students, \"We who wear the cloth of our nation must hold dear the principle of an apolitical military that is so deeply rooted in the very essence of our Republic.\"          His speech followed Defense Secretary Mark Esper's announcement of a major review last week aimed at improving diversity and \"ensuring equal opportunity across all ranks\" of the US military.          The Pentagon effort to address racism and promote equality, even as leaders try to avoid White House politics, has been notable and follows Milley's extraordinary apology for appearing in a photo-op with Trump after the forceful dispersal of peaceful protesters outside the White House earlier this month.          Esper similarly acknowledged the problematic nature of his own appearance and later told reporters he did not want to see active duty forces on the streets of Washington, DC -- a statement that increased tensions between the Pentagon and the White House.          Several current defense officials with access to both men say the two are deeply concerned about Trump attempting to politicize the military and potentially dragging the forces into the presidential election campaign.          \"Both realize over the last month that the Defense Department has been overexposed and politicized\" a senior administration official said, blaming both the White House and Democrats.          While there are always political tensions as an election looms, Trump has done little to assure Esper or Milley of his unqualified support for them. In an interview with Axios , Trump said Esper and Milley should have been \"proud\" to be with in the photo-op.          Esper has repeatedly let it be known he thought Trump might fire him and he had also prepared a letter of resignation earlier this month. Similarly, Milley consulted a number of senior retired and military officers to seek their advice on whether he could continue effectively in the role, according to officials with direct knowledge.          While Milley has made two speeches to military audiences, and Esper has visited some military bases, neither of them has engaged publicly or answered questions from the press in recent weeks.          On Wednesday, Esper departed for meetings at NATO in Brussels, in part to discuss Trump's orders to remove 10,000 troops from Germany , something the Pentagon is not anxious to do in the face of Russian aggression in eastern Europe. That trip is expected to be very low key with Esper currently not scheduled to speak publicly.          However, Esper and Milley may not be able to avoid tough questions for long.          There are tentative plans for them to testify before the House Armed Services Committee just after the July 4 recess about the use of National Guard troops and the calling up of active duty forces during the recent protests prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.          That hearing could be the first time the brewing tensions between the Pentagon and the White House are brought clearly into the public view.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Department of Homeland Security created a fake university that it touted as ‘authorized to enroll international students’. Photograph: Alamy US immigration How the US government created a fake university to snare immigrant students Court documents reveal stunning scheme used to trap 161 foreign nationals; Ice maintains the students knew the school was fake          The University of Farmington website described a college that would prepare students to succeed in an “ever-globalizing economy”. Students would show up at campus wearing backpacks and asking questions about classes. The US government listed Farmington as eligible to enroll foreign students. The school president, whose LinkedIn page is still online, sent emails to students describing his institution as “a nationally accredited institution authorized to enroll international students”.          Court documents unsealed last month unveiled a stunning scheme by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to create a fake university – with no classes or professors, just a staff of undercover agents who went on to build a case that has seen 161 foreign nationals arrested.          “These are students who are trying to make their lives better, these are not criminals, these are not people who are here leeching off the system,” said Amer Zahr, an adjunct professor of law at the University of Detroit-Mercy and a spokesman for Najlaa Krim Musarsa, one of the students arrested.          Musarsa, a 29-year-old woman from Palestine, was one of those arrested without trial for civil immigration violations because she enrolled in the university, located just outside of Detroit in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Eight other people were charged with criminal violations and are accused of helping enroll the students in exchange for cash, kickbacks and tuition credits from February 2017 to January 2019.          “Everyone was taken completely by surprise,” Zahr said. “There was no warning of this action. There was no notice given to her [Musarsa] that she was out of status, that this university was fake.”          Most of the students were Indian and the country’s government issued a rare “démarche” to the US embassy in New Delhi stating the government needed immediate access to the detainees. As of 5 February, India consular officials had visited 36 different detention centers across the US and created a 24/7 hotline for impacted students.          Since the indictment was unsealed on 30 January, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has maintained each of the more than 600 people enrolled at the University of Farmington knew they would not attend real classes or earn credits. “Their intent was to fraudulently maintain their student visa status and to obtain work authorization,” the indictment said.          Faiza Patel, the codirector of the liberty and national security program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said it was not 100% clear that every student knew what they were getting into.          “It’s an open question as to whether this is the best use of Ice’s resources,” Patel said. “I think these days we have a lot of open questions about whether the way Ice is responding is a logical response to the problems this country faces.”          At the University of Farmington, federal agents posed as school officials in emails and registered the school with the state of Michigan, according to emails obtained by the Detroit Free Press. Workers at the building listed as University of Farmington’s location told local news channel WXYZ that students would come in asking what time the school opened and closed and complained they had trouble getting in touch with school representatives.          The undercover operation was led by the nation’s second largest investigative agency, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which is one of the three branches of Ice. A 2008 Ice handbook leaked last year showed that while undercover agents are advised not to induce people to commit crimes, exceptions can be made and are internally regulated.          This is not the first sham university created by Ice. In 2016, the agency announced the University of Northern New Jersey was not a legitimate school and its only employees were undercover agents. Then, too, the government insisted the more than 1,000 students were aware they were participating in a fraud. About 20 brokers were also arrested for recruiting students.          Angelo Guisado, the staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said DHS carried out the operation aware that it could send hundreds of people to immigration courts, which do not have the same constitutional protections as other courts.          “Ice knowing this or DHS knowing this tries to ensnare as many people as possible and get them wound up in an immigration system where they know that the cards are going to be stacked against the immigrant,” Guisado said.</td>\n",

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley counseled the audience to \"eliminate anything that divides us.\"          While he also spoke of the traditional need to keep an eye on adversaries \"during periods when we are weary from conflict or otherwise preoccupied,\" and did not mention President Donald Trump by name, his comments appeared to address the broader backdrop of racial divisiveness in the country and concerns within the Pentagon about the military becoming politicized.          Milley told the students, \"We who wear the cloth of our nation must hold dear the principle of an apolitical military that is so deeply rooted in the very essence of our Republic.\"          His speech followed Defense Secretary Mark Esper's announcement of a major review last week aimed at improving diversity and \"ensuring equal opportunity across all ranks\" of the US military.          The Pentagon effort to address racism and promote equality, even as leaders try to avoid White House politics, has been notable and follows Milley's extraordinary apology for appearing in a photo-op with Trump after the forceful dispersal of peaceful protesters outside the White House earlier this month.          Esper similarly acknowledged the problematic nature of his own appearance and later told reporters he did not want to see active duty forces on the streets of Washington, DC -- a statement that increased tensions between the Pentagon and the White House.          Several current defense officials with access to both men say the two are deeply concerned about Trump attempting to politicize the military and potentially dragging the forces into the presidential election campaign.          \"Both realize over the last month that the Defense Department has been overexposed and politicized\" a senior administration official said, blaming both the White House and Democrats.          While there are always political tensions as an election looms, Trump has done little to assure Esper or Milley of his unqualified support for them. In an interview with Axios , Trump said Esper and Milley should have been \"proud\" to be with in the photo-op.          Esper has repeatedly let it be known he thought Trump might fire him and he had also prepared a letter of resignation earlier this month. Similarly, Milley consulted a number of senior retired and military officers to seek their advice on whether he could continue effectively in the role, according to officials with direct knowledge.          While Milley has made two speeches to military audiences, and Esper has visited some military bases, neither of them has engaged publicly or answered questions from the press in recent weeks.          On Wednesday, Esper departed for meetings at NATO in Brussels, in part to discuss Trump's orders to remove 10,000 troops from Germany , something the Pentagon is not anxious to do in the face of Russian aggression in eastern Europe. That trip is expected to be very low key with Esper currently not scheduled to speak publicly.          However, Esper and Milley may not be able to avoid tough questions for long.          There are tentative plans for them to testify before the House Armed Services Committee just after the July 4 recess about the use of National Guard troops and the calling up of active duty forces during the recent protests prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.          That hearing could be the first time the brewing tensions between the Pentagon and the White House are brought clearly into the public view.   \n",
       "1  The Department of Homeland Security created a fake university that it touted as ‘authorized to enroll international students’. Photograph: Alamy US immigration How the US government created a fake university to snare immigrant students Court documents reveal stunning scheme used to trap 161 foreign nationals; Ice maintains the students knew the school was fake          The University of Farmington website described a college that would prepare students to succeed in an “ever-globalizing economy”. Students would show up at campus wearing backpacks and asking questions about classes. The US government listed Farmington as eligible to enroll foreign students. The school president, whose LinkedIn page is still online, sent emails to students describing his institution as “a nationally accredited institution authorized to enroll international students”.          Court documents unsealed last month unveiled a stunning scheme by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to create a fake university – with no classes or professors, just a staff of undercover agents who went on to build a case that has seen 161 foreign nationals arrested.          “These are students who are trying to make their lives better, these are not criminals, these are not people who are here leeching off the system,” said Amer Zahr, an adjunct professor of law at the University of Detroit-Mercy and a spokesman for Najlaa Krim Musarsa, one of the students arrested.          Musarsa, a 29-year-old woman from Palestine, was one of those arrested without trial for civil immigration violations because she enrolled in the university, located just outside of Detroit in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Eight other people were charged with criminal violations and are accused of helping enroll the students in exchange for cash, kickbacks and tuition credits from February 2017 to January 2019.          “Everyone was taken completely by surprise,” Zahr said. “There was no warning of this action. There was no notice given to her [Musarsa] that she was out of status, that this university was fake.”          Most of the students were Indian and the country’s government issued a rare “démarche” to the US embassy in New Delhi stating the government needed immediate access to the detainees. As of 5 February, India consular officials had visited 36 different detention centers across the US and created a 24/7 hotline for impacted students.          Since the indictment was unsealed on 30 January, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has maintained each of the more than 600 people enrolled at the University of Farmington knew they would not attend real classes or earn credits. “Their intent was to fraudulently maintain their student visa status and to obtain work authorization,” the indictment said.          Faiza Patel, the codirector of the liberty and national security program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said it was not 100% clear that every student knew what they were getting into.          “It’s an open question as to whether this is the best use of Ice’s resources,” Patel said. “I think these days we have a lot of open questions about whether the way Ice is responding is a logical response to the problems this country faces.”          At the University of Farmington, federal agents posed as school officials in emails and registered the school with the state of Michigan, according to emails obtained by the Detroit Free Press. Workers at the building listed as University of Farmington’s location told local news channel WXYZ that students would come in asking what time the school opened and closed and complained they had trouble getting in touch with school representatives.          The undercover operation was led by the nation’s second largest investigative agency, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which is one of the three branches of Ice. A 2008 Ice handbook leaked last year showed that while undercover agents are advised not to induce people to commit crimes, exceptions can be made and are internally regulated.          This is not the first sham university created by Ice. In 2016, the agency announced the University of Northern New Jersey was not a legitimate school and its only employees were undercover agents. Then, too, the government insisted the more than 1,000 students were aware they were participating in a fraud. About 20 brokers were also arrested for recruiting students.          Angelo Guisado, the staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said DHS carried out the operation aware that it could send hundreds of people to immigration courts, which do not have the same constitutional protections as other courts.          “Ice knowing this or DHS knowing this tries to ensnare as many people as possible and get them wound up in an immigration system where they know that the cards are going to be stacked against the immigrant,” Guisado said.   \n",

       "      <td>It's ironic that Democrats and their mouthpieces in media have been pounding the table the past few years about Russia, Russia, Russia and the importance of preserving the integrity of our elections while overlooking the fox in the henhouse of Silicon Valley. A powerful tech sector, run by ultra-liberal political activists at Twitter and other social media networks, routinely censor conservatives and any voices that stray from its left-wing ideology. This includes Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., whose Twitter account was suspended last August. This week, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, tweeted: \"Two years ago, Twitter shadow bans @RepMattGaetz @MarkMeadows @DevinNunes and myself. Now they've decided to censor @realDonaldTrump What's next, @jack?\" Of course, Jack Dorsey, Twitter's CEO, denies any foul play while the rest of us see pervasive evidence of alarming political bias -- and de facto election meddling. Take Twitter's latest attempt to humiliate President Donald Trump by fact-checking some of his tweets expressing concern about mail-in voter fraud. This week, Twitter singularly targeted the president -- in the midst of a presidential election cycle -- effectively labeling his tweets as \"fake news\" despite ample evidence that mail-in voter fraud exists. Had Twitter administrators bothered to do a simple internet search, they would've found that federal prosecutors charged Thomas Cooper, a 47-year-old postal carrier, on Tuesday for fraudulently altering mail-in ballots from one political party to another. Or Twitter's content monitors could've easily gone to WhiteHouse.gov and found a comprehensive study done by the Heritage Foundation which details scores of examples of voter fraud surrounding absentee ballots. Or, heck, Twitter could've watched a 2004 video available on YouTube by Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who warned: \"Paper ballots are EXTREMELY susceptible to fraud... I can show you experience which would make your head spin.\" This is precisely what the president was warning us about in his tweets, but alas, Twitter's \"fact-checkers\" either didn't bother to do basic research or, worse, deliberately chose not to. If you suspect it's the latter, then you are correct given the politically charged, anti-Trump tweets recently uncovered and outlined in an eye-opening piece at medianame. Yoel Roth, Twitter's Head of Site Integrity has tweeted his disdain for our commander in chief and the millions of patriotic, law-abiding Americans who support him. In November 2016, Roth tweeted \"I'm just saying, we fly over those states that voted for a racist tangerine for a reason.\" Translation: If you live in \"fly-over\" states and voted for Trump, then your voice doesn't count. Or how about this missive? In September 2016, Roth tweeted: \"I've never donated to a presidential campaign before, but I just gave $100 to Hillary for America. We can't f--- around anymore.\" Roth has also compared the Trump administration to \"ACTUAL NAZIS.\" This is who Twitter wants us to trust as a \"neutral\" fact-checker. Now also consider that when Twitter \"fact-checked\" the president, it linked to selectively chosen information that attempts to counter the accuracy of the president's tweets. Articles that were -- you guessed it -- created by anti-Trump left-wing media. No bias there right? But that's not all. What's also glaringly obvious and warranting the executive action by the president we're told is forthcoming is that Twitter hasn't fact-checked any Democratic lawmakers, media outlets or blue check-marked \"journalists\" who've spent the past four years spreading malicious lies and misinformation about the Russia collusion conspiracy theory and propaganda campaign that was waged against President Trump and his 2016 campaign since debunked by a special counsel probe. This stacked deck has sparked a widespread backlash against Twitter and a historic warning by the president via tweet Thursday morning: \"This will be a Big Day for Social Media and FAIRNESS!\" The president is expected to announce an executive order addressing the matter in the near future. Not a minute too soon! Twitter has not only demonstrated rampant political bias for far too long -- it's also crossed the line into election meddling -- as studies have shown most voters get their news online. It's high time to right the ship.</td>\n",

What does this mean for Washington's efforts to rein in big tech, mergers and the ongoing antitrust investigation in Congress? On Thursday, May 7, at 9 a.m. ET, join my colleague and POLITICO technology reporter Cristiano Lima for a conversation with House antitrust subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.). to discuss what's next for Silicon Valley and Washington in the era of coronavirus. Register here to attend.          LAUNCHING TODAY: A NEW 5G COALITION — It’s not often you hear Facebook and 5G in the same sentence. But Facebook is among the group of 31 tech and telecom players coming together today to launch a new 5G-focused coalition aimed at policymaking and getting lawmakers to back virtual, software-based alternatives to the type of physical 5G infrastructure sold by Huawei and Ericsson.          — While Trump administration figures like economic adviser Larry Kudlow have touted this technology, known as “open radio access,” as a way to counter China’s 5G dominance, this new group, called the Open RAN Policy Coalition, is instead stressing its importance for industry competition. The coalition argues that by implementing virtual infrastructure that can work across various 5G-supporting technologies, more vendors can be involved in next-gen 5G wireless and those networks can be more secure.          — Diane Rinaldo, who served as acting chief of NTIA for half of 2019, will helm the effort. Facebook is joined by Microsoft, AT&amp;T, DISH Network and some two dozen other members. Several of those member companies already belong to the separate O-RAN Alliance. Rinaldo told John that while that existing alliance is “focused on standard-setting bodies,” the new coalition is focused on “domestic and global policy and things we can do to help educate lawmakers” on member efforts. “Different companies were getting calls asking for their input so really it was just an ad hoc group that came together,” she added. “Right now it’s a lot of Zoom calls.”          — Lawmakers in both chambers have floated legislation to create a pot of funding to research open-RAN 5G technology, and House E&amp;C aides have even hinted they may want to secure such provisions in upcoming coronavirus relief. Coalition member IBM, meanwhile, is out today with a policy brief calling on administration 5G strategies to embrace this network architectural openness at the Commerce Department, Pentagon and FCC.          THINK TANK SLAMS SILICON VALLEY’S USE OF H-1B VISAS — Leading Silicon Valley companies are using the H-1B visa program to underpay migrant workers, asserts a new report by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Intel, IBM, Cisco, Oracle, Qualcomm, Salesforce and Uber — companies with some of the largest numbers of approved H-1B visas — “take advantage of program rules in order to legally pay many of their H-1B workers below the local median wage for the jobs they fill,” according to the report, which noted that this is the case for some 60 percent of H-1B positions.          — Jog your memory: President Donald Trump in late April signed an executive order to temporarily suspend some immigration into the U.S. because of the coronavirus crisis, prompting backlash from the tech world. Companies warned the measure would hurt the internet industry at a time the country needs it most. But H-1B visas, heavily relied on by Silicon Valley for engineers, computer programmers and others, were notably not suspended under the president’s order.          — The authors of the report are recommending the Department of Labor adjust H-1B salary requirements (which vary by occupation and location) and that Congress enact legislation to solidify those changes. “It is long past time for the Department of Labor and Congress to act to prevent H-1B migrant workers from being underpaid and exploited,” co-author Ron Hira said in a statement. The report’s other author, EPI director of immigration law and policy research Daniel Costa, credited the H-1B visa program for bringing a talented tech workforce to the U.S but argued it’s “in desperate need of reform.” He called the pay discrepancies highlighted in the report a “fundamental flaw” in the rules governing the visas.          STATE AGS’ PLEA TO HELP FIGHT ROBOCALLS DURING PANDEMIC — The National Association of Attorneys General is calling on USTelecom’s robocall-fighting squad (known formally as the Industry Traceback Group) to work with state AGs to crack down on surging robocalls.          — On the rise: Scammers have been preying on the coronavirus pandemic since March, as MT reported. Ericsson subsidiary iconectiv, the “policy administrator” that has been leading industry efforts to tamp down on illegal robocalls, has warned that fraudulent calls may increase in the coming weeks as more government stimulus checks hit the bank accounts of tens of millions of Americans.          — “Given the exponential growth of illegal robocalls targeting the American public, the state attorneys general plan to continue intensifying our enforcement efforts against illegal robocallers and other related bad actors,” the AGs wrote Monday to USTelecom President and CEO Jonathan Spalter. They asked for continued public-private collaboration with USTelecom’s Industry Traceback Group, which is responsible for tracing where robocalls originate. Spalter replied: “You can count on us.”          Hank Dempsey is joining Snap’s public policy team as its first head of public policy for California. ... Amanda Renteria, who recently helped lead Emerge America, an organization that recruits and trains women to run for office, was appointed CEO of Code for America. … Kevin Lewis, a former partner at Blue Engine Message &amp; Media and an Obama alum, is now executive comms manager at Facebook. … Nicole Kaeding, vice president of policy promotion and economist at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, is joining Amazon’s policy shop on May 11 as a senior manager for public policy, focused on federal tax issues. … Sam duPont, former director for ICT services and digital trade at Services and Investment at the U.S. Trade Representative, is now deputy director of the German Marshall Fund's tech policy program, GMF Digital.          Across the pond: “Almost 40 Facebook pages across the European Union with large online followings continue to spread falsehoods and conspiracy theories about Covid-19 despite the social network's promise to clamp down,” POLITICO Europe reports.          Contact tracing update: Weeks before Apple and Google are set to deploy contact tracing technology to address the pandemic, the Silicon Valley heavyweights announced new privacy boundaries for public health officials, Steven reports for Pros.          Facebook moves: Tim Bray, a former vice president of Amazon Web Services, quit last week over the recent firings of activist employees, he wrote in a blog post, calling Amazon’s actions “evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture.”          Influencer, or political hopeful?: “Candidates can’t campaign, so they’re trying to go viral,” The Verge reports, exploring how lesser-known contenders must get more creative when in-person grass-roots campaigns are impossible.          By the numbers: Six in 10 Americans (roughly 63 percent) do not understand current privacy laws and government regulations, according to a Pew Research Center report, but three-quarters favor more of it.

Phil Roe (R), and incumbent Rep. Scott DesJarlais once again survived a Republican primary challenge. * The Trump campaign formally requested that the Commission on Presidential Debates add a fourth general-election debate this year. Yesterday, the CPD said no, and it's not altogether clear what the Republican operation intends to do about it. * Facebook yesterday said it would ban ads from The Committee to Defend the President, a pro-Trump super PAC that Facebook concluded has repeatedly shared content \"determined by third-party fact-checkers to be false. * Speaking of the social-media giant, Facebook also yesterday removed a foreign troll farm posing as African-American supporters of the Trump campaign. * In Maine, the latest Quinnipiac poll found Sara Gideon (D) leading incumbent Sen. Susan Collins (R), 47% to 43%. The same poll found Joe Biden leading Trump in Maine by 15 points. * In Kentucky, Quinnipiac also found Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) leading Amy McGrath (D), but only by five points, 49% to 44%. Trump leads Biden in the Bluegrass State, however, 50% to 41%. * In South Carolina, as hard as this may be to believe, Quinnipiac found Sen.

Trump, meanwhile, leads Biden in the state, 47% to 42%. * And as Republican operatives scramble to get Kanye West onto the 2020 ballot, the entertainer seemed to confirm to Forbes magazine yesterday that he's not seriously pursuing the presidency. Reminded that he won't be on enough state ballots to reach 270 electoral votes, and was therefore running as a spoiler candidate to help Trump, West responded, \"I'm not going to argue with you.

       "      <td>Opinion | Elizabeth Warren's plan for big tech makes her the Teddy Roosevelt of 2020</td>\n",
       "      <td>In running for president, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., seemingly wants to be to Google what Teddy Roosevelt was to Standard Oil. She has proposed unwinding specific mergers that have led to anti-competitive and even monopolistic behavior — Facebook and Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, Amazon and Whole Foods, Google and the ad network DoubleClick, among others.          Rhetorically, the proposal is flawless: Warren repeatedly invokes competitive markets — which are sacred to conservatives — as her rationale for wanting stiffer regulations, and offers a litany of harms that Facebook, Google and Amazon have caused for the country and municipalities that generously house them. Her pitch is pithy, well-argued and all but guaranteed to chase away the already-skeptical big-money wing of the Democratic party.          It's also a policy proposal so interesting that it has overwhelmed the normal nitpicking criticism of her public persona, at least temporarily. (I honestly can’t remember the last time that happened, especially to a woman.)          And the details of the proposal are wonky and clever, posted for anyone to read on Medium, with components that can be divorced from one another and adopted as independent initiatives, as well as those gigantically ambitious suggestions right at the top.          Among the other details of the plan is her suggestion that “[c]ompanies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more and that offer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties would be designated as ‘platform utilities,’” and subject to significant data-sharing and data privacy restrictions that might make their current business models untenable. Essentially, if a tech company has a public-facing “store,” under the Warren plan, it would suddenly be subject to a host of new, federally-mandated rules as soon as it broke the $25 billion barrier to, as she said, make sure that, \"Small businesses would have a fair shot to sell their products on Amazon without the fear of Amazon pushing them out of business.\"          It’s a straightforwardly radical suggestion — especially given the laissez-faire way the last several administrations have allowed tech companies to evolve — but it is also easily achievable within our current regulatory framework and has plenty of distinguished precedent.          But a good argument alone has not been enough to convince most people in Warren’s position; the topic of tech industry regulation has proven a depressingly accurate test for determining which politicians have the strength of their convictions, and which can be persuaded by lobbyists and large campaign contributions to gently bend their ideals.          Despite companies subverting consumer protections with anti-competitive mergers and ignoring what little regulation does exist at every turn, Democrats — who receive the vast majority of donations from employees of and PACs related to these firms — have done little beyond holding hearings and proposing weak bills, into the negotiations over which the tech companies try to insert themselves. And, at the opposite end of the spectrum, Republican congressmen and senators like Steve King and John Kennedy openly threaten tech CEOs with regulation as punishment for their perceived unfriendliness to conservative points of view — though Republicans publicly deplore regulation on and off the campaign trail.          Warren’s proposal, however, points to deeper problems than just inaction, ineffectiveness and posturing among her colleagues in the Senate. The executive branch — as Warren knows well — has the power to rein in cash-spewing monopolies more effectively than any other branch of government. Expensive lawyers can win court cases and donors can twist the arms of legislators, but the president appoints the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission and prominent officials at the Justice and Treasury Departments.          Of Donald Trump’s many betrayals of his constituents he promised to protect by \"draining the swamp,\" the most serious may be his population of these jobs with lobbyists, sycophants, crooks and other of the swamp's many denizens. Warren, were she to win the presidential race in 2020, could staff them with people who would bring oligarchs and technocrats to heel, pursue trials of companies who flout regulations rather than settlements and wouldn’t dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (which she helped create) the way Trump’s director, Mick Mulvaney, did.          Basic fairness dictates that, at this point, tech companies should be informed that they can’t vampirize the society that houses them, bleeding it dry of personal information, money and workers’ lives. This morning saw a report in the Daily Beast of nearly 200 calls to 911 from Amazon warehouses, many of them from suicidal workers; if our government can’t force the richest man in the world to ensure working conditions that don't necessitate emergency psychiatric interventions by trained medical personnel, what good is it?          Warren may not be president — she may not even win the primary — but she has distinguished herself considerably by all-but daring powerful lobbyists to pour cash into her opponents’ war chests. She's issued an understandable a proposal on a complicated industry that ought to be broadly popular with a public that loves net neutrality and doesn’t trust tech companies.          Plus, the proposal shows a confounding faith in human nature, given the events of the last two years. Here’s hoping she’s right to have it; it's increasingly clear that the tech companies' profits rely on a fundamentally different view of humanity.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In which we explained that when it comes to our personal data and information, the primary Privacy concern is – government.          The government shouldn’t have any more of it than is absolutely, Constitutionally necessary. And it shouldn’t force private companies to give it up – save for absolutely necessary, Constitutional exceptions.          Then there’s the wild card scenario – when private companies unilaterally give it to government.          We discussed how foundational Facebook personnel – with their access to the Facebook formula – helped enormously to fundamentally transform Senator Obama into President Obama. And as we enter the 2012 election cycle, how their assistance continues still.          Fellow online data monster Google was and still is just as helpful to Obama, Inc.          Google gives you Search, GMail, YouTube, Google+, Google Docs, Google Phone, etc.          You – knowingly, and inadvertently through electronic snooping osmosis – give them gobs and gobs of your personal data.          It’s the price you pay for all their “free” stuff.          Google’s $814,540 made it the fifth biggest cash contributor to Obama 2008. But it’s given to Obama in oh so many other ways.          The President relies on Google execs for tech and economic advice as his own regulators scrutinize the online-ad behemoth. Is the romance starting to sour?          Google Chairman Eric Schmidt Doubles Down On His Support Of President Obama          That’s the same Eric Schmidt who was a member of Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. But the relationship doesn’t end even there.          Some Perspective on Obama’s Bromance with Eric Schmidt          And then there is Andrew McLaughlin.          Google’s Washington Influence Is Spreading, Some Say Too Much          A former Googler–he was their head of public policy–he’s been hired by the Obama administration as the White House’s deputy CTO (Chief Technology Officer – he started after the election and left in 2011), invoking the wrath of a House Oversight Committee member in the process.          Rep. Darrell Issa has written to Google to demand an explanation as to how McLaughlin could have “used his personal email account to engage in official business, including discussions on policy matters under his review with Google.”          McLaughlin was cited for two kinds of actions: using a personal email account for some professional email exchanges and for violating restrictions on contacts with Google, his former employer.          Most notable among the latter were a pair of conversations with the Director of U.S. Public Policy for Google about mobilizing Google’s resources to respond to negative press mentions.          Those breaches, according to a memo by OSTP Director John Holdren, “implicated” the Federal Records Act and the President’s Ethics Pledge signed by McLaughlin upon his employment as an Obama administration point person on innovation and Internet policy, within the White House Office of Technology and Science Policy.          In other words, McLaughlin was using Google resources – Search manipulations? your data? – to help Obama spin away his negative-ness.          Not exactly what you signed up for when you wanted G-Chat, was it?          Google’s move to consolidate your private data across all their platforms – so as to optimize its use – isn’t in and of itself all that disturbing, at least to me.          Their data consolidation – combined with their intimate Obama Administration relationship – is to me disturbing on stilts.          In fact, the examples of Google violating their own motto – “Don’t Be Evil” – are so numerous as to be morbidly laughable.          And now that election season has arrived:          Obama’s 2012 campaign is watching you          Obama for America has already invested millions of dollars in sophisticated Internet messaging, marketing and fund raising efforts that rely on personal data sometimes offered up voluntarily– like posts on a Facebook page– but sometimes not.          And according to a campaign official and former Obama staffer, the campaign’s Chicago-based headquarters has built a centralized digital database of information about millions of potential Obama voters.          It all means Obama is finding it easier than ever to merge offline data, such as voter files and information purchased from data brokers, with online information to target people with messages that may appeal to their personal tastes. Privacy advocates say it’s just the sort of digital snooping that his new privacy project is supposed to discourage….          “All of the data used to be in different silos. You never had a central place,” said Dan Siroker, a former director of analytics for Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and deputy new media director for his presidential transition team who now runs online marketing optimization firm Optimizely.          So Chris Hughes builds Facebook – and then builds MyBarackObama.com.          So Google breaks down their data silos and centralizes – and then Obama follows suit.          The more of our personal data they get, the less privacy – and freedom – we have.          I’m not at all bothered by private companies gathering my data so as to optimize my online experience.          I’d of course very much like these data stockpiles protected. From hackers – and from the government.          And I certainly don’t want these private companies to unilaterally hand over my data to the Federales.          I signed up for a Facebook page and G-Mail. I didn’t sign up to help Barack Obama get (re)elected.</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It's ironic that Democrats and their mouthpieces in media have been pounding the table the past few years about Russia, Russia, Russia and the importance of preserving the integrity of our elections while overlooking the fox in the henhouse of Silicon Valley. A powerful tech sector, run by ultra-liberal political activists at Twitter and other social media networks, routinely censor conservatives and any voices that stray from its left-wing ideology. This includes Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., whose Twitter account was suspended last August. This week, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, tweeted: \"Two years ago, Twitter shadow bans @RepMattGaetz @MarkMeadows @DevinNunes and myself. Now they've decided to censor @realDonaldTrump What's next, @jack?\" Of course, Jack Dorsey, Twitter's CEO, denies any foul play while the rest of us see pervasive evidence of alarming political bias -- and de facto election meddling. Take Twitter's latest attempt to humiliate President Donald Trump by fact-checking some of his tweets expressing concern about mail-in voter fraud. This week, Twitter singularly targeted the president -- in the midst of a presidential election cycle -- effectively labeling his tweets as \"fake news\" despite ample evidence that mail-in voter fraud exists. Had Twitter administrators bothered to do a simple internet search, they would've found that federal prosecutors charged Thomas Cooper, a 47-year-old postal carrier, on Tuesday for fraudulently altering mail-in ballots from one political party to another. Or Twitter's content monitors could've easily gone to WhiteHouse.gov and found a comprehensive study done by the Heritage Foundation which details scores of examples of voter fraud surrounding absentee ballots. Or, heck, Twitter could've watched a 2004 video available on YouTube by Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who warned: \"Paper ballots are EXTREMELY susceptible to fraud... I can show you experience which would make your head spin.\" This is precisely what the president was warning us about in his tweets, but alas, Twitter's \"fact-checkers\" either didn't bother to do basic research or, worse, deliberately chose not to. If you suspect it's the latter, then you are correct given the politically charged, anti-Trump tweets recently uncovered and outlined in an eye-opening piece at medianame. Yoel Roth, Twitter's Head of Site Integrity has tweeted his disdain for our commander in chief and the millions of patriotic, law-abiding Americans who support him. In November 2016, Roth tweeted \"I'm just saying, we fly over those states that voted for a racist tangerine for a reason.\" Translation: If you live in \"fly-over\" states and voted for Trump, then your voice doesn't count. Or how about this missive? In September 2016, Roth tweeted: \"I've never donated to a presidential campaign before, but I just gave $100 to Hillary for America. We can't f--- around anymore.\" Roth has also compared the Trump administration to \"ACTUAL NAZIS.\" This is who Twitter wants us to trust as a \"neutral\" fact-checker. Now also consider that when Twitter \"fact-checked\" the president, it linked to selectively chosen information that attempts to counter the accuracy of the president's tweets. Articles that were -- you guessed it -- created by anti-Trump left-wing media. No bias there right? But that's not all. What's also glaringly obvious and warranting the executive action by the president we're told is forthcoming is that Twitter hasn't fact-checked any Democratic lawmakers, media outlets or blue check-marked \"journalists\" who've spent the past four years spreading malicious lies and misinformation about the Russia collusion conspiracy theory and propaganda campaign that was waged against President Trump and his 2016 campaign since debunked by a special counsel probe. This stacked deck has sparked a widespread backlash against Twitter and a historic warning by the president via tweet Thursday morning: \"This will be a Big Day for Social Media and FAIRNESS!\" The president is expected to announce an executive order addressing the matter in the near future. Not a minute too soon! Twitter has not only demonstrated rampant political bias for far too long -- it's also crossed the line into election meddling -- as studies have shown most voters get their news online. It's high time to right the ship.   \n",

What does this mean for Washington's efforts to rein in big tech, mergers and the ongoing antitrust investigation in Congress? On Thursday, May 7, at 9 a.m. ET, join my colleague and POLITICO technology reporter Cristiano Lima for a conversation with House antitrust subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.). to discuss what's next for Silicon Valley and Washington in the era of coronavirus. Register here to attend.          LAUNCHING TODAY: A NEW 5G COALITION — It’s not often you hear Facebook and 5G in the same sentence. But Facebook is among the group of 31 tech and telecom players coming together today to launch a new 5G-focused coalition aimed at policymaking and getting lawmakers to back virtual, software-based alternatives to the type of physical 5G infrastructure sold by Huawei and Ericsson.          — While Trump administration figures like economic adviser Larry Kudlow have touted this technology, known as “open radio access,” as a way to counter China’s 5G dominance, this new group, called the Open RAN Policy Coalition, is instead stressing its importance for industry competition. The coalition argues that by implementing virtual infrastructure that can work across various 5G-supporting technologies, more vendors can be involved in next-gen 5G wireless and those networks can be more secure.          — Diane Rinaldo, who served as acting chief of NTIA for half of 2019, will helm the effort. Facebook is joined by Microsoft, AT&T, DISH Network and some two dozen other members. Several of those member companies already belong to the separate O-RAN Alliance. Rinaldo told John that while that existing alliance is “focused on standard-setting bodies,” the new coalition is focused on “domestic and global policy and things we can do to help educate lawmakers” on member efforts. “Different companies were getting calls asking for their input so really it was just an ad hoc group that came together,” she added. “Right now it’s a lot of Zoom calls.”          — Lawmakers in both chambers have floated legislation to create a pot of funding to research open-RAN 5G technology, and House E&C aides have even hinted they may want to secure such provisions in upcoming coronavirus relief. Coalition member IBM, meanwhile, is out today with a policy brief calling on administration 5G strategies to embrace this network architectural openness at the Commerce Department, Pentagon and FCC.          THINK TANK SLAMS SILICON VALLEY’S USE OF H-1B VISAS — Leading Silicon Valley companies are using the H-1B visa program to underpay migrant workers, asserts a new report by the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Intel, IBM, Cisco, Oracle, Qualcomm, Salesforce and Uber — companies with some of the largest numbers of approved H-1B visas — “take advantage of program rules in order to legally pay many of their H-1B workers below the local median wage for the jobs they fill,” according to the report, which noted that this is the case for some 60 percent of H-1B positions.          — Jog your memory: President Donald Trump in late April signed an executive order to temporarily suspend some immigration into the U.S. because of the coronavirus crisis, prompting backlash from the tech world. Companies warned the measure would hurt the internet industry at a time the country needs it most. But H-1B visas, heavily relied on by Silicon Valley for engineers, computer programmers and others, were notably not suspended under the president’s order.          — The authors of the report are recommending the Department of Labor adjust H-1B salary requirements (which vary by occupation and location) and that Congress enact legislation to solidify those changes. “It is long past time for the Department of Labor and Congress to act to prevent H-1B migrant workers from being underpaid and exploited,” co-author Ron Hira said in a statement. The report’s other author, EPI director of immigration law and policy research Daniel Costa, credited the H-1B visa program for bringing a talented tech workforce to the U.S but argued it’s “in desperate need of reform.” He called the pay discrepancies highlighted in the report a “fundamental flaw” in the rules governing the visas.          STATE AGS’ PLEA TO HELP FIGHT ROBOCALLS DURING PANDEMIC — The National Association of Attorneys General is calling on USTelecom’s robocall-fighting squad (known formally as the Industry Traceback Group) to work with state AGs to crack down on surging robocalls.          — On the rise: Scammers have been preying on the coronavirus pandemic since March, as MT reported. Ericsson subsidiary iconectiv, the “policy administrator” that has been leading industry efforts to tamp down on illegal robocalls, has warned that fraudulent calls may increase in the coming weeks as more government stimulus checks hit the bank accounts of tens of millions of Americans.          — “Given the exponential growth of illegal robocalls targeting the American public, the state attorneys general plan to continue intensifying our enforcement efforts against illegal robocallers and other related bad actors,” the AGs wrote Monday to USTelecom President and CEO Jonathan Spalter. They asked for continued public-private collaboration with USTelecom’s Industry Traceback Group, which is responsible for tracing where robocalls originate. Spalter replied: “You can count on us.”          Hank Dempsey is joining Snap’s public policy team as its first head of public policy for California. ... Amanda Renteria, who recently helped lead Emerge America, an organization that recruits and trains women to run for office, was appointed CEO of Code for America. … Kevin Lewis, a former partner at Blue Engine Message & Media and an Obama alum, is now executive comms manager at Facebook. … Nicole Kaeding, vice president of policy promotion and economist at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, is joining Amazon’s policy shop on May 11 as a senior manager for public policy, focused on federal tax issues. … Sam duPont, former director for ICT services and digital trade at Services and Investment at the U.S. Trade Representative, is now deputy director of the German Marshall Fund's tech policy program, GMF Digital.          Across the pond: “Almost 40 Facebook pages across the European Union with large online followings continue to spread falsehoods and conspiracy theories about Covid-19 despite the social network's promise to clamp down,” POLITICO Europe reports.          Contact tracing update: Weeks before Apple and Google are set to deploy contact tracing technology to address the pandemic, the Silicon Valley heavyweights announced new privacy boundaries for public health officials, Steven reports for Pros.          Facebook moves: Tim Bray, a former vice president of Amazon Web Services, quit last week over the recent firings of activist employees, he wrote in a blog post, calling Amazon’s actions “evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture.”          Influencer, or political hopeful?: “Candidates can’t campaign, so they’re trying to go viral,” The Verge reports, exploring how lesser-known contenders must get more creative when in-person grass-roots campaigns are impossible.          By the numbers: Six in 10 Americans (roughly 63 percent) do not understand current privacy laws and government regulations, according to a Pew Research Center report, but three-quarters favor more of it.



Senate primary, thanks in part to Donald Trump's backing. In November, Hagerty will face Memphis environmentalist Marquita Bradshaw, who unexpectedly won the Democratic Senate primary, defeating Nashville attorney and former Army helicopter pilot James Mackler, who enjoyed the DSCC's backing. * In Tennessee's U.S. House primaries, Diana Harshbarger won a very crowded GOP primary in the race to replace retiring Rep. Phil Roe (R), and incumbent Rep. Scott DesJarlais once again survived a Republican primary challenge. * The Trump campaign formally requested that the Commission on Presidential Debates add a fourth general-election debate this year. Yesterday, the CPD said no, and it's not altogether clear what the Republican operation intends to do about it. * Facebook yesterday said it would ban ads from The Committee to Defend the President, a pro-Trump super PAC that Facebook concluded has repeatedly shared content \"determined by third-party fact-checkers to be false. * Speaking of the social-media giant, Facebook also yesterday removed a foreign troll farm posing as African-American supporters of the Trump campaign. * In Maine, the latest Quinnipiac poll found Sara Gideon (D) leading incumbent Sen. Susan Collins (R), 47% to 43%. The same poll found Joe Biden leading Trump in Maine by 15 points. * In Kentucky, Quinnipiac also found Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) leading Amy McGrath (D), but only by five points, 49% to 44%. Trump leads Biden in the Bluegrass State, however, 50% to 41%. * In South Carolina, as hard as this may be to believe, Quinnipiac found Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) tied with Jaime Harrison (D), with each garnering 44% support. Trump, meanwhile, leads Biden in the state, 47% to 42%. * And as Republican operatives scramble to get Kanye West onto the 2020 ballot, the entertainer seemed to confirm to Forbes magazine yesterday that he's not seriously pursuing the presidency.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., seemingly wants to be to Google what Teddy Roosevelt was to Standard Oil. She has proposed unwinding specific mergers that have led to anti-competitive and even monopolistic behavior — Facebook and Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, Amazon and Whole Foods, Google and the ad network DoubleClick, among others.          Rhetorically, the proposal is flawless: Warren repeatedly invokes competitive markets — which are sacred to conservatives — as her rationale for wanting stiffer regulations, and offers a litany of harms that Facebook, Google and Amazon have caused for the country and municipalities that generously house them. Her pitch is pithy, well-argued and all but guaranteed to chase away the already-skeptical big-money wing of the Democratic party.          It's also a policy proposal so interesting that it has overwhelmed the normal nitpicking criticism of her public persona, at least temporarily. (I honestly can’t remember the last time that happened, especially to a woman.)          And the details of the proposal are wonky and clever, posted for anyone to read on Medium, with components that can be divorced from one another and adopted as independent initiatives, as well as those gigantically ambitious suggestions right at the top.          Among the other details of the plan is her suggestion that “[c]ompanies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more and that offer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties would be designated as ‘platform utilities,’” and subject to significant data-sharing and data privacy restrictions that might make their current business models untenable. Essentially, if a tech company has a public-facing “store,” under the Warren plan, it would suddenly be subject to a host of new, federally-mandated rules as soon as it broke the $25 billion barrier to, as she said, make sure that, \"Small businesses would have a fair shot to sell their products on Amazon without the fear of Amazon pushing them out of business.\"          It’s a straightforwardly radical suggestion — especially given the laissez-faire way the last several administrations have allowed tech companies to evolve — but it is also easily achievable within our current regulatory framework and has plenty of distinguished precedent.          But a good argument alone has not been enough to convince most people in Warren’s position; the topic of tech industry regulation has proven a depressingly accurate test for determining which politicians have the strength of their convictions, and which can be persuaded by lobbyists and large campaign contributions to gently bend their ideals.          Despite companies subverting consumer protections with anti-competitive mergers and ignoring what little regulation does exist at every turn, Democrats — who receive the vast majority of donations from employees of and PACs related to these firms — have done little beyond holding hearings and proposing weak bills, into the negotiations over which the tech companies try to insert themselves. And, at the opposite end of the spectrum, Republican congressmen and senators like Steve King and John Kennedy openly threaten tech CEOs with regulation as punishment for their perceived unfriendliness to conservative points of view — though Republicans publicly deplore regulation on and off the campaign trail.          Warren’s proposal, however, points to deeper problems than just inaction, ineffectiveness and posturing among her colleagues in the Senate. The executive branch — as Warren knows well — has the power to rein in cash-spewing monopolies more effectively than any other branch of government. Expensive lawyers can win court cases and donors can twist the arms of legislators, but the president appoints the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission and prominent officials at the Justice and Treasury Departments.          Of Donald Trump’s many betrayals of his constituents he promised to protect by \"draining the swamp,\" the most serious may be his population of these jobs with lobbyists, sycophants, crooks and other of the swamp's many denizens. Warren, were she to win the presidential race in 2020, could staff them with people who would bring oligarchs and technocrats to heel, pursue trials of companies who flout regulations rather than settlements and wouldn’t dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (which she helped create) the way Trump’s director, Mick Mulvaney, did.          Basic fairness dictates that, at this point, tech companies should be informed that they can’t vampirize the society that houses them, bleeding it dry of personal information, money and workers’ lives. This morning saw a report in the Daily Beast of nearly 200 calls to 911 from Amazon warehouses, many of them from suicidal workers; if our government can’t force the richest man in the world to ensure working conditions that don't necessitate emergency psychiatric interventions by trained medical personnel, what good is it?          Warren may not be president — she may not even win the primary — but she has distinguished herself considerably by all-but daring powerful lobbyists to pour cash into her opponents’ war chests. She's issued an understandable a proposal on a complicated industry that ought to be broadly popular with a public that loves net neutrality and doesn’t trust tech companies.          Plus, the proposal shows a confounding faith in human nature, given the events of the last two years. Here’s hoping she’s right to have it; it's increasingly clear that the tech companies' profits rely on a fundamentally different view of humanity.   \n",

The government shouldn’t have any more of it than is absolutely, Constitutionally necessary. And it shouldn’t force private companies to give it up – save for absolutely necessary, Constitutional exceptions.          Then there’s the wild card scenario – when private companies unilaterally give it to government.          We discussed how foundational Facebook personnel – with their access to the Facebook formula – helped enormously to fundamentally transform Senator Obama into President Obama. And as we enter the 2012 election cycle, how their assistance continues still.          Fellow online data monster Google was and still is just as helpful to Obama, Inc.          Google gives you Search, GMail, YouTube, Google+, Google Docs, Google Phone, etc.          You – knowingly, and inadvertently through electronic snooping osmosis – give them gobs and gobs of your personal data.          It’s the price you pay for all their “free” stuff.          Google’s $814,540 made it the fifth biggest cash contributor to Obama 2008. But it’s given to Obama in oh so many other ways.          The President relies on Google execs for tech and economic advice as his own regulators scrutinize the online-ad behemoth. Is the romance starting to sour?          Google Chairman Eric Schmidt Doubles Down On His Support Of President Obama          That’s the same Eric Schmidt who was a member of Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. But the relationship doesn’t end even there.          Some Perspective on Obama’s Bromance with Eric Schmidt          And then there is Andrew McLaughlin.          Google’s Washington Influence Is Spreading, Some Say Too Much          A former Googler–he was their head of public policy–he’s been hired by the Obama administration as the White House’s deputy CTO (Chief Technology Officer – he started after the election and left in 2011), invoking the wrath of a House Oversight Committee member in the process.          Rep. Darrell Issa has written to Google to demand an explanation as to how McLaughlin could have “used his personal email account to engage in official business, including discussions on policy matters under his review with Google.”          McLaughlin was cited for two kinds of actions: using a personal email account for some professional email exchanges and for violating restrictions on contacts with Google, his former employer.          Most notable among the latter were a pair of conversations with the Director of U.S. Public Policy for Google about mobilizing Google’s resources to respond to negative press mentions.          Those breaches, according to a memo by OSTP Director John Holdren, “implicated” the Federal Records Act and the President’s Ethics Pledge signed by McLaughlin upon his employment as an Obama administration point person on innovation and Internet policy, within the White House Office of Technology and Science Policy.          In other words, McLaughlin was using Google resources – Search manipulations? your data? – to help Obama spin away his negative-ness.          Not exactly what you signed up for when you wanted G-Chat, was it?          Google’s move to consolidate your private data across all their platforms – so as to optimize its use – isn’t in and of itself all that disturbing, at least to me.          Their data consolidation – combined with their intimate Obama Administration relationship – is to me disturbing on stilts.          In fact, the examples of Google violating their own motto – “Don’t Be Evil” – are so numerous as to be morbidly laughable.          And now that election season has arrived:          Obama’s 2012 campaign is watching you          Obama for America has already invested millions of dollars in sophisticated Internet messaging, marketing and fund raising efforts that rely on personal data sometimes offered up voluntarily– like posts on a Facebook page– but sometimes not.          And according to a campaign official and former Obama staffer, the campaign’s Chicago-based headquarters has built a centralized digital database of information about millions of potential Obama voters.          It all means Obama is finding it easier than ever to merge offline data, such as voter files and information purchased from data brokers, with online information to target people with messages that may appeal to their personal tastes. Privacy advocates say it’s just the sort of digital snooping that his new privacy project is supposed to discourage….          “All of the data used to be in different silos. You never had a central place,” said Dan Siroker, a former director of analytics for Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and deputy new media director for his presidential transition team who now runs online marketing optimization firm Optimizely.          So Chris Hughes builds Facebook – and then builds MyBarackObama.com.          So Google breaks down their data silos and centralizes – and then Obama follows suit.          The more of our personal data they get, the less privacy – and freedom – we have.          I’m not at all bothered by private companies gathering my data so as to optimize my online experience.          I’d of course very much like these data stockpiles protected. From hackers – and from the government.          And I certainly don’t want these private companies to unilaterally hand over my data to the Federales.          I signed up for a Facebook page and G-Mail. I didn’t sign up to help Barack Obama get (re)elected.   \n",

       "      <td>President Barack Obama’s chief campaign strategist and senior adviser David Axelrod said that even if President Trump is impeached, it is not likely he will be convicted by the Senate and removed from office.          Appearing on CNN Tuesday evening after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry, Axelrod, 64, tossed water on some lawmakers’ hopes that impeachment would successfully remove Trump from the White House.          “This is a moment of extraordinary historical import,” Axelrod noted. “Only three presidents in history who were impeached. But it’s also true that no president in history has ever been convicted and removed from office and it is very, very unlikely that that’s going to happen here.\"          He pointed out that a large number of Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate would have to vote with the Democrats in order to form the 67 votes needed to oust the president.          “We should be sober about it. But we also kind of know how this story is going to end,” Axelrod said. “Donald Trump is not going to be removed from office, but this is overhang that he will have to deal with over the next many months as he is seeking reelection.”          Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were the only presidents to have been impeached by the House of Representatives, though neither were convicted.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Honor a congressional subpoena to appear at President Trump’s (presumably eventual) Senate impeachment trial? Joe Biden, still the odds-on favorite to be the Democrats’ standard-bearer in the 2020 election, scoffed at the very idea: No way! The former vice president’s knee-jerk obstinacy illuminates — we should say, provides even more illumination of — the patent farce that is the second article of impeachment passed by the House on a strict party-line vote: the accusation that the president has obstructed Congress. As we saw in a committee hearing, featuring the spectacle of staffers questioning staffers with no actual fact witnesses in sight, Democrats have no problem when Democrats blow off congressional demands for information. “Obstruction” is a one-way street. Trump regards the impeachment inquiry as a partisan witch hunt, just the latest phase of the Democrats’ project to remove him, which began even before his term started. He certainly has a point, although that is not a good reason to give his opponents fuel for the project, as he did by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden. That is the allegation in the first article of impeachment. Under the circumstances, I believe it falls well short of the egregious misconduct for which impeachment should be reserved; it was, nevertheless, a foolish thing for the president to do. Let’s focus, though, on the second impeachment article, obstruction of Congress. To be clear, Congress has undeniable constitutional authority, broad in scope, to conduct oversight of the executive branch. The president, with all the authority of a peer branch of government, has extensive privileges of confidentiality, rooted in Article II, particularly when it comes to communications with his staff and high executive officials. Congress, however, is empowered to probe, especially when its concern is presidential malfeasance, or the activities of executive branch agencies Congress has created — such agencies, after all, are led by officers subject to Senate confirmation, and Congress both underwrites them with taxpayer funds and limits their operations by statute.</td>\n",

       "      <td>GOP congressman blasts Trump for quoting evangelical pastor's ‘civil war’ threat: ‘This is beyond repugnant’</td>\n",
       "      <td>Appearing on Fox News on Sunday, Robert Jeffress — one of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical sycophants — asserted that Trump’s impeachment could cause “a Civil War-like fracture” in the United States. Trump repeated Jeffress’ assertion on Twitter — and got an angry response from a fellow Republican: Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.          Jeffress, pastor at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, is a prominent figure on the Christian Right. And during his Sunday appearance on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends,” Jeffress insisted to co-hosts Pete Hegseth and Jedediah Bila that Trump has done nothing to deserve impeachment and attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for supporting an impeachment inquiry — stressing, “I do want to make this prediction this morning: if the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, I’m afraid it will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal.”          On Twitter, Trump quoted Jeffress and zeroed right in on the Civil War part:          Upon seeing Trump’s post, Kinzinger angrily tweeted in response, “I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.”          A 41-year-old military veteran who served in the U.S. Air Force during the Iraq War, Kinzinger was first elected to the House as a Republican in 2010.          Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives because of a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript/summary of that conversation shows that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into digging up dirt on a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden — which Pelosi, formerly the Democratic Party’s most prominent opponent of impeaching Trump, considers an impeachable offense.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trump impeachment inquiry sparked by effort to uncover ‘witch hunt’ origins</td>\n",
       "      <td>At the heart of the infamous Ukraine phone call that prompted House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is President Trump’s vow to get to the bottom of the origins of the Russia probe, which dominated the first two-plus years of his presidency.          In trying to uncover how the “witch hunt” began, Mr. Trump now faces a bigger political crisis.          The Trump campaign came out swinging this weekend against impeachment, launching a $10 million TV and digital ad accusing Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden of meddling in Ukraine. Political insiders say it’s a strong indication of how Mr. Trump intends to fight back.          “He’ll be very aggressive,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. “I think ultimately his game plan is to make sure the base is with him. He understands this is a political fight, not a legal fight, and he’s going to play politics. He knows that if he loses the base, he loses the game.”          Mr. Trump and his aides in the early days of the crisis have gone on the attack against an unnamed government whistleblower who prompted the charges while also firing back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Chairman Adam B. Schiff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The White House message is that this latest political peril for Mr. Trump is all part of the same partisan hatred that has dogged him from the start.          “There are no high crimes and misdemeanors here,” said White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. “People were talking about impeaching this president before he even got inaugurated. And now they’re getting their wish. Nancy Pelosi finally capitulated to her angry mob.”          She said the American people “will see what’s not getting done” in Congress while Democrats devote their attention to impeaching Mr. Trump in a strong economy.          The president also echoed a prediction Sunday by Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel that the Democrats’ impeachment effort will backfire, especially in Democratic House districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016.          “Will happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in 50 Trump type Districts,” the president tweeted. “We will win big!”          In trying to sustain his 2020 reelection bid, Mr. Trump is still fighting a battle over his 2016 campaign.          The president’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 started with pleasantries, but quickly shifted Mr. Trump’s interest in a missing Democratic National Committee server that was hacked by Russia during the 2016 election.          “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine … The server, they say Ukraine has it,” the president told Mr. Zelensky.          He also mentioned the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which the DNC hired in 2016 to investigate the breach of its servers and first reported Russia as the culprit.          The president’s conversation took place a day after special counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress, an appearance that was criticized as weak. Mr. Mueller did confirm the findings of his report, which found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the election.          “As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance,” Mr. Trump told Ukraine’s leader. “But they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”          The Justice Department has announced that U.S. attorney John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane” probe into alleged links between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia, was already looking into whether the Ukrainian government led by then-President Petro Poroshenko was involved in the effort to torpedo Mr. Trump’s candidacy.          Mr. Zelensky raised the name of the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani had canceled a trip to Ukraine last spring to investigate whether the previous Ukrainian administration helped Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign by providing information concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s lobbying work in the country.          Mr. Giuliani also was probing why Ukraine fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who had been looking into Hunter Biden’s lucrative position with a Ukrainian energy company.          “This is what they [Democrats] did to Manafort,” said veteran Washington lawyer John Down, who represented the president in the Mueller probe. “They went overseas and they dug all this stuff up. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”          The Hill reported in May that the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington said a Democratic National Committee contractor solicited dirt on Manafort during the 2016 campaign and even tried to enlist the country’s president to help.          The contractor later tried to arrange for Mr. Poroshenko to comment on Manafort’s Russian ties during a visit to the U.S. during the 2016 campaign, the Ukrainian ambassador said.          As for Mr. Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, the president’s conservative allies also believe there is a potential connection to the origins of the Russia allegations against Mr. Trump.          “Biden was responsible for U.S. policy in Ukraine during the Obama administration, and much of the false narrative about President Donald Trump being a Russian agent came from Ukraine, the United Kingdom and other Western intelligence agencies, which his administration put a bow on and shipped to the FISA court so they could spy on the Trump campaign in 2016,” said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government. “What did Joe Biden know about Russiagate and when did he know it?”          The president also has directed most of his campaign criticism at Mr. Biden, perceiving him as his likeliest — and probably toughest — opponent in the general election. He’s gone to considerable lengths to take him out early during the Democratic primary, openly questioning his fitness for office.          “I think he’s the weakest mentally, and I like running against people that are weak mentally,” the president said of Mr. Biden last summer.          Democrats are using the president’s effort to investigate the Bidens in Ukraine as their primary argument for impeachment, accusing the president of seeking foreign help in interfering in a U.S. election. Mr. Biden is, for now, still the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.          At the time of the phone call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine.          “I think we have to stay focused as far as the public is concerned on the fact that the president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday.          Mrs. Pelosi also suggested that Russia played a role in the saga.          “It is wrong for any foreign government to interfere in our elections and here you have the president of the United States asking for that,” she said without elaborating. “I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way.”          The White House ended the week with Mr. Trump declaring “we’re at war” with the Democrats. The president and his allies were also questioning the motives of the unnamed government whistleblower, who’s reportedly a CIA officer.          Mr. Trump last week also suggested he could go to court to stop the Democrats.          “There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts,” Mr. Trump said.          Even some Republicans close to the White House say impeachment is a real concern.          “I think there’s a good chance of impeachment,” said one administration ally. “Will he be removed [by the Senate]? No. Will he even care? I think he thinks it would be one more big reality TV moment, and he’s the star of it.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>We've grown used to radical Leftists, in Congress and the media, having their soup de jour, the accusation of the day. But this latest one has actually prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry. What is the accusation? President Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president to congratulate him on his election and discussed several things, including the investigation of alleged illegal conduct on the part of the son of a prominent American politician. This is just another fail. Within the past few weeks, the Left has floated impeaching Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, criticized Vice President Mike Pence for an extended stay during a visit to his foreign, historical family home, melted down over the President’s invitation of national leaders of the G7 to one of his properties, and most ludicrously, blasted him for allegedly stealing pancakes. HANS VON SPAKOVSKY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT EFFORT WILL BE HISTORIC POLITICAL BATTLE – HERE'S HOW THE PROCESS WORKS          The media wonders why its credibility is in the dumpster. The Left wonders why the President has the approval of most Americans, higher than former President Barack Obama at the same juncture of his term. The standard bearer of the latest effort to impeach President Trump is Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of the House intelligence Committee. You will remember him for his zealous advocacy for reliance on the Mueller Report. Schiff promised that evidence of Russian collusion was real, present, and would be confirmed in the Mueller Report. Oops. The Mueller investigation did not support Schiff’s promised conclusion. In fact, it found that there was no collusion, cooperation or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. So here we are again. The Democrats desire to get the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This seems wholly unwarranted based on the allegations of an unknown person, who probably did not even hear the conversation. This individual apparently heard about the conversation from someone else. Such testimony would never be allowed in court because it is inherently unreliable. And, it reveals something about the way things work in the White House. It seems that the President has no private conversations with leaders of foreign countries. I suspect that the leaders of other nations understand that those conversations are scrutinized by the U.S. intelligence apparatus. But I also believe that foreign leaders do not anticipate that Americans are so cavalier as to transcribe these conversations and then pass them on to Congress, which seems to have the loosest of lips. In fact, foreign leaders probably do not realize there is a threat that their conversations could be leaked, if given to Schiff, a person that former Congressman Trey Gowdy has described as leakier than a screen-door on a submarine. What do the Ukrainian leaders have to say about the content of the conversation? Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko says there were no threats. There was nothing untoward or out of the ordinary in the conversation. Joe Biden once bragged that he had been in Ukraine and demanded that its leaders fire a prosecutor who was investigating allegations of wrongdoing of an international energy company, or else. Oh, by the way, Biden’s son, Hunter, sat on the board of directors of that company. Was it out of line to inquire of an American who was under investigation by the Ukrainians? They projected a false narrative for years, creating a division in our nation that may not heal for a generation, that the Trump administration is illegitimate because of Russian “collusion” in the 2016 election. But, it turns out, that Ukrainians donated tens of millions of dollars to the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee. In fact, the Ukraine government voted to investigate that. Prediction: the Left will persist in its quixotic quest to remove President Donald Trump. And, when the Ukraine telephone gambit fades, look for the next stolen pancake allegation to consume our misguided friends.</td>\n",

strategist and senior adviser David Axelrod said that even if President Trump is impeached, it is not likely he will be convicted by the Senate and removed from office.          Appearing on CNN Tuesday evening after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry, Axelrod, 64, tossed water on some lawmakers’ hopes that impeachment would successfully remove Trump from the White House.          “This is a moment of extraordinary historical import,” Axelrod noted. “Only three presidents in history who were impeached. But it’s also true that no president in history has ever been convicted and removed from office and it is very, very unlikely that that’s going to happen here.\"          He pointed out that a large number of Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate would have to vote with the Democrats in order to form the 67 votes needed to oust the president.          “We should be sober about it. But we also kind of know how this story is going to end,” Axelrod said. “Donald Trump is not going to be removed from office, but this is overhang that he will have to deal with over the next many months as he is seeking reelection.”          Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were the only presidents to have been impeached by the House of Representatives, though neither were convicted.\n",

Honor a congressional subpoena to appear at President Trump’s (presumably eventual) Senate impeachment trial? Joe Biden, still the odds-on favorite to be the Democrats’ standard-bearer in the 2020 election, scoffed at the very idea: No way! The former vice president’s knee-jerk obstinacy illuminates — we should say, provides even more illumination of — the patent farce that is the second article of impeachment passed by the House on a strict party-line vote: the accusation that the president has obstructed Congress. As we saw in a committee hearing, featuring the spectacle of staffers questioning staffers with no actual fact witnesses in sight, Democrats have no problem when Democrats blow off congressional demands for information. “Obstruction” is a one-way street. Trump regards the impeachment inquiry as a partisan witch hunt, just the latest phase of the Democrats’ project to remove him, which began even before his term started. He certainly has a point, although that is not a good reason to give his opponents fuel for the project, as he did by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden. That is the allegation in the first article of impeachment. Under the circumstances, I believe it falls well short of the egregious misconduct for which impeachment should be reserved; it was, nevertheless, a foolish thing for the president to do. Let’s focus, though, on the second impeachment article, obstruction of Congress. To be clear, Congress has undeniable constitutional authority, broad in scope, to conduct oversight of the executive branch. The president, with all the authority of a peer branch of government, has extensive privileges of confidentiality, rooted in Article II, particularly when it comes to communications with his staff and high executive officials. Congress, however, is empowered to probe, especially when its concern is presidential malfeasance, or the activities of executive branch agencies Congress has created — such agencies, after all, are led by officers subject to Senate confirmation, and Congress both underwrites them with taxpayer funds and limits their operations by statute.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Appearing on Fox News on Sunday, Robert Jeffress — one of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical sycophants — asserted that Trump’s impeachment could cause “a Civil War-like fracture” in the United States. Trump repeated Jeffress’ assertion on Twitter — and got an angry response from a fellow Republican: Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.          Jeffress, pastor at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, is a prominent figure on the Christian Right. And during his Sunday appearance on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends,” Jeffress insisted to co-hosts Pete Hegseth and Jedediah Bila that Trump has done nothing to deserve impeachment and attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for supporting an impeachment inquiry — stressing, “I do want to make this prediction this morning: if the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, I’m afraid it will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal.”          On Twitter, Trump quoted Jeffress and zeroed right in on the Civil War part:          Upon seeing Trump’s post, Kinzinger angrily tweeted in response, “I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.”          A 41-year-old military veteran who served in the U.S. Air Force during the Iraq War, Kinzinger was first elected to the House as a Republican in 2010.          Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives because of a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript/summary of that conversation shows that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into digging up dirt on a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden — which Pelosi, formerly the Democratic Party’s most prominent opponent of impeaching Trump, considers an impeachable offense.\n",
       "223                                   Trump impeachment inquiry sparked by effort to uncover ‘witch hunt’ origins  At the heart of the infamous Ukraine phone call that prompted House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is President Trump’s vow to get to the bottom of the origins of the Russia probe, which dominated the first two-plus years of his presidency.          In trying to uncover how the “witch hunt” began, Mr. Trump now faces a bigger political crisis.          The Trump campaign came out swinging this weekend against impeachment, launching a $10 million TV and digital ad accusing Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden of meddling in Ukraine. Political insiders say it’s a strong indication of how Mr. Trump intends to fight back.          “He’ll be very aggressive,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. “I think ultimately his game plan is to make sure the base is with him. He understands this is a political fight, not a legal fight, and he’s going to play politics. He knows that if he loses the base, he loses the game.”          Mr. Trump and his aides in the early days of the crisis have gone on the attack against an unnamed government whistleblower who prompted the charges while also firing back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Chairman Adam B. Schiff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The White House message is that this latest political peril for Mr. Trump is all part of the same partisan hatred that has dogged him from the start.          “There are no high crimes and misdemeanors here,” said White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. “People were talking about impeaching this president before he even got inaugurated. And now they’re getting their wish. Nancy Pelosi finally capitulated to her angry mob.”          She said the American people “will see what’s not getting done” in Congress while Democrats devote their attention to impeaching Mr. Trump in a strong economy.          The president also echoed a prediction Sunday by Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel that the Democrats’ impeachment effort will backfire, especially in Democratic House districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016.          “Will happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in 50 Trump type Districts,” the president tweeted. “We will win big!”          In trying to sustain his 2020 reelection bid, Mr. Trump is still fighting a battle over his 2016 campaign.          The president’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 started with pleasantries, but quickly shifted Mr. Trump’s interest in a missing Democratic National Committee server that was hacked by Russia during the 2016 election.          “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine … The server, they say Ukraine has it,” the president told Mr. Zelensky.          He also mentioned the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which the DNC hired in 2016 to investigate the breach of its servers and first reported Russia as the culprit.          The president’s conversation took place a day after special counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress, an appearance that was criticized as weak. Mr. Mueller did confirm the findings of his report, which found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the election.          “As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance,” Mr. Trump told Ukraine’s leader. “But they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”          The Justice Department has announced that U.S. attorney John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane” probe into alleged links between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia, was already looking into whether the Ukrainian government led by then-President Petro Poroshenko was involved in the effort to torpedo Mr. Trump’s candidacy.          Mr. Zelensky raised the name of the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani had canceled a trip to Ukraine last spring to investigate whether the previous Ukrainian administration helped Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign by providing information concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s lobbying work in the country.          Mr. Giuliani also was probing why Ukraine fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who had been looking into Hunter Biden’s lucrative position with a Ukrainian energy company.          “This is what they [Democrats] did to Manafort,” said veteran Washington lawyer John Down, who represented the president in the Mueller probe. “They went overseas and they dug all this stuff up. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”          The Hill reported in May that the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington said a Democratic National Committee contractor solicited dirt on Manafort during the 2016 campaign and even tried to enlist the country’s president to help.          The contractor later tried to arrange for Mr. Poroshenko to comment on Manafort’s Russian ties during a visit to the U.S. during the 2016 campaign, the Ukrainian ambassador said.          As for Mr. Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, the president’s conservative allies also believe there is a potential connection to the origins of the Russia allegations against Mr. Trump.          “Biden was responsible for U.S. policy in Ukraine during the Obama administration, and much of the false narrative about President Donald Trump being a Russian agent came from Ukraine, the United Kingdom and other Western intelligence agencies, which his administration put a bow on and shipped to the FISA court so they could spy on the Trump campaign in 2016,” said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government. “What did Joe Biden know about Russiagate and when did he know it?”          The president also has directed most of his campaign criticism at Mr. Biden, perceiving him as his likeliest — and probably toughest — opponent in the general election. He’s gone to considerable lengths to take him out early during the Democratic primary, openly questioning his fitness for office.          “I think he’s the weakest mentally, and I like running against people that are weak mentally,” the president said of Mr. Biden last summer.          Democrats are using the president’s effort to investigate the Bidens in Ukraine as their primary argument for impeachment, accusing the president of seeking foreign help in interfering in a U.S. election. Mr. Biden is, for now, still the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.          At the time of the phone call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine.          “I think we have to stay focused as far as the public is concerned on the fact that the president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday.          Mrs. Pelosi also suggested that Russia played a role in the saga.          “It is wrong for any foreign government to interfere in our elections and here you have the president of the United States asking for that,” she said without elaborating. “I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way.”          The White House ended the week with Mr. Trump declaring “we’re at war” with the Democrats. The president and his allies were also questioning the motives of the unnamed government whistleblower, who’s reportedly a CIA officer.          Mr. Trump last week also suggested he could go to court to stop the Democrats.          “There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts,” Mr. Trump said.          Even some Republicans close to the White House say impeachment is a real concern.          “I think there’s a good chance of impeachment,” said one administration ally. “Will he be removed [by the Senate]?

But this latest one has actually prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry. What is the accusation? President Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president to congratulate him on his election and discussed several things, including the investigation of alleged illegal conduct on the part of the son of a prominent American politician. This is just another fail. Within the past few weeks, the Left has floated impeaching Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, criticized Vice President Mike Pence for an extended stay during a visit to his foreign, historical family home, melted down over the President’s invitation of national leaders of the G7 to one of his properties, and most ludicrously, blasted him for allegedly stealing pancakes. HANS VON SPAKOVSKY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT EFFORT WILL BE HISTORIC POLITICAL BATTLE – HERE'S HOW THE PROCESS WORKS          The media wonders why its credibility is in the dumpster. The Left wonders why the President has the approval of most Americans, higher than former President Barack Obama at the same juncture of his term. The standard bearer of the latest effort to impeach President Trump is Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of the House intelligence Committee. You will remember him for his zealous advocacy for reliance on the Mueller Report. Schiff promised that evidence of Russian collusion was real, present, and would be confirmed in the Mueller Report. Oops. The Mueller investigation did not support Schiff’s promised conclusion. In fact, it found that there was no collusion, cooperation or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. So here we are again. The Democrats desire to get the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This seems wholly unwarranted based on the allegations of an unknown person, who probably did not even hear the conversation. This individual apparently heard about the conversation from someone else. Such testimony would never be allowed in court because it is inherently unreliable. And, it reveals something about the way things work in the White House. It seems that the President has no private conversations with leaders of foreign countries. I suspect that the leaders of other nations understand that those conversations are scrutinized by the U.S. intelligence apparatus. But I also believe that foreign leaders do not anticipate that Americans are so cavalier as to transcribe these conversations and then pass them on to Congress, which seems to have the loosest of lips. In fact, foreign leaders probably do not realize there is a threat that their conversations could be leaked, if given to Schiff, a person that former Congressman Trey Gowdy has described as leakier than a screen-door on a submarine. What do the Ukrainian leaders have to say about the content of the conversation? Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko says there were no threats. There was nothing untoward or out of the ordinary in the conversation. Joe Biden once bragged that he had been in Ukraine and demanded that its leaders fire a prosecutor who was investigating allegations of wrongdoing of an international energy company, or else. Oh, by the way, Biden’s son, Hunter, sat on the board of directors of that company. Was it out of line to inquire of an American who was under investigation by the Ukrainians? They projected a false narrative for years, creating a division in our nation that may not heal for a generation, that the Trump administration is illegitimate because of Russian “collusion” in the 2016 election. But, it turns out, that Ukrainians donated tens of millions of dollars to the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee. In fact, the Ukraine government voted to investigate that. Prediction: the Left will persist in its quixotic quest to remove President Donald Trump. And, when the Ukraine telephone gambit fades, look for the next stolen pancake allegation to consume our misguided friends."

       "      <td>President Donald Trump cycled through a range of conflicting reactions Tuesday as Democrats moved swiftly toward concrete congressional action on impeachment.          The president moved from dismissing the renewed push by Democrats for impeachment proceedings early in the day to bemoaning the effort's impact while holding meetings with world leaders at the United Nations just a few hours later, to expressing social media outrage over \"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\" as evening fell.          \"Pelosi, Nadler, Schiff and, of course, Maxine Waters! Can you believe this?\" he asked in a late afternoon tweetstorm shortly after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry. By Wednesday morning, Trump lamented on Twitter that there \"has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have.\"          \"The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear,\" he continued, additionally calling the new impeachment push a \"Witch Hunt!\"          Meanwhile, the day's impeachment developments were being met inside his inner circle with a mix of trepidation and defiance, as the president and his allies entered what they acknowledged was uncharted territory, according to multiple sources familiar with their thinking.          Pelosi's move followed growing outrage among Democrats at Trump's reported pressure on Ukraine's president to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden while that country was awaiting U.S. aid he'd delayed, including a request during a summer phone call between the two leaders.          Early Tuesday, Trump dismissed the Democratic outrage as partisan posturing. “I think it’s a ridiculous witch hunt,” Trump said ahead of his morning remarks at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, reviving some of the same pushback he used during former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. “I’m leading in the polls. The only way they can stop me is impeachment.”          Download the medianame News app for breaking news and politics          As news broke later in the day that Pelosi planned to announce a formal impeachment inquiry, Trump said that he would release a transcript Wednesday morning.          \"You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,\" he tweeted. \"...This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\"          Democrats have called for the full release of a complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower that is said to include, but not be limited to, that call. A senior administration official said the White House was preparing to turn over the whistleblower complaint by this Thursday.          Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said a lawyer for the whistleblower had contacted his committee saying they would like to testify, and that the panel has requested guidance from the acting Director of National Intelligence on how to move forward.          Later Tuesday afternoon, ahead of a meeting by Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss potential action, the president accused the party of failing to take action on a range of issues, including gun safety, due to presidential investigations. “So bad for our Country!” he tweeted.          Then, during a meeting with the Iraqi president, he ran through a list of U.S. economic indicators, saying \"the country’s doing the best it’s ever done, and I just heard that [Pelosi would] like to impeach.\"          \"...If she does that, they all say that’s a positive for me in the election,\" he said. \"You could also say: who needs it, it’s bad for the country.”          Trump's damage control efforts on the domestic front Tuesday came as he looked to make his mark on the world stage, making a speech to the United Nations General Assembly and holding a string of meetings with world leaders.          \"Such an important day at the United Nations,\" he tweeted Tuesday afternoon, moments after Pelosi's announcement. \"So much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!\"          While Democrats have spent the last two years calling for various lines of impeachment, Pelosi is now triggering an official process that could translate to months of hearings, subpoenas and witness testimony — and, potentially, both new revelations and the passage of articles of impeachment as the president battles for re-election.          There is no indication yet that Trump could be removed from office, which would require a two-thirds vote from the Republican-led Senate.          More than two-thirds of House Democrats now back some type of impeachment action — still not enough to claim the simple House majority needed to pass articles of impeachment if the rest of the caucus does not go along, but a significant increase since last week.          On Monday, The Washington Post and other media outlets reported that Trump instructed his chief of staff to place a hold on $400 million in military aid for Ukraine in the days before a late July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.          Trump told reporters Tuesday that his request to withhold the aid was due to his desire to see greater European contributions to Ukraine’s defense, and not linked to whether the country would investigate the Biden family, which media outlets have reported Trump brought up on the call with Zelensky.          Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday he was never given an explanation for why the funds were being withheld, despite pressing senior administration officials about it at the time.          The White House has publicly sought to link the latest controversy — over whether Trump sought help from a foreign country to go after one of his chief political rivals — to the Russia election meddling investigation, which they have asserted exonerated the president, though it listed numerous instances of possible obstruction of justice.          “The media pushed the Russia lie for almost three years with no evidence, and now they are doing it all over again,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told medianame News in a statement Monday. “These allegations are completely false, but because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they’ll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this president.”          Trump's campaign has also argued that the latest effort is another attempt by the Democrats to overturn the 2016 election results.          \"They’ve always wanted to impeach him, and they’ve just been shopping around for an excuse,\" said Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh.          McConnell's reaction to the news late Tuesday echoed the White House's line of attack, accusing Democrats of “searching for ways to reverse their 2016 election defeat since before President Trump was even inaugurated and a \"rush to judgment\" and saying the move “simply confirms that House Democrats’ priority is not making life better for the American people but their nearly three-year-old fixation on impeachment.”          So did House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's. \"I realize 2016 did not turn out the way Speaker Pelosi wanted it to happen,\" said McCarthy, R-Calif. \"But she cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide we’re in an impeachment inquiry.\" House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, like the president, called the impeachment push a \"witch hunt\" that was being \"used to try to go and usurp the results of an election in 2016.\"          While sources close to the president said they didn’t want to see impeachment, they were prepared to argue it could be “helpful” in mobilizing the core supporters inside the president’s base.          Some allies predicted the move would backfire on Democrats, particularly if the transcript being released Wednesday failed to show a smoking gun — and the president’s campaign was already working to capitalize on the upcoming impeachment fight.          Over the course of several hours, the campaign sent multiple fundraising pitches to supporters, including the launch of an “Official Impeachment Defense Task Force.\" It also released a video attacking Democrats calling for impeachment, which Murtaugh said had been \"ready for weeks in case the Democrats were that dumb. And they were.”          Inside the White House, this round of impeachment talks was viewed as more politically perilous than during the Russia investigation, said one White House aide. Whether and how the White House is able to spin the transcript — and what the polling indicates over the next few days — will determine if this is yet another scandal to weather or a marked shift in public sentiment, the aide said.          Ahead of the Pelosi announcement, Republicans in Congress had been largely silent on the issue, with allies backing his allegations of corruption by Biden. The most critical GOP reaction came from Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who told medianame News Monday that Trump “should make available the whistleblower complaint that has been deemed to be credible and urgent.\"          \"I think it'd be very helpful to get the bottom of the facts,\" Romney said. \"If they don't, it will be up to the House to decide how to proceed.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>McCarthy Fires Back At Pelosi After Impeachment Calls: ‘Cannot Change The Laws’</td>\n",
       "      <td>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy fired back at Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi after she came out in favor of the impeachment of President Donald Trump for the first time Tuesday after meeting with her caucus.          In a Tuesday night press conference on Capitol Hill, McCarthy said Pelosi’s calls for impeachment are due to the Democrats losing the presidency in 2016, saying this is proof they have not yet got over the election. McCarthy also said their job is to legislate, not to continue to find dirt on the President.          “This election is over. I realize 2016 did not turn out the way Speaker Pelosi wanted it to happen. But she cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide when an impeachment inquiry,” McCarthy said to reporters. What she said today made no difference of what’s been going on.” (RELATED: Nancy Pelosi Comes Out In Favor Of Impeachment)          Pelosi then publicly announced late Tuesday afternoon, “Today I’m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.” (RELATED: McCarthy Meets With US Trade Rep Robert Lighthizer About USMCA)          Despite Pelosi’s early reluctance to push for impeachment, there are currently 174 Democrats who support impeachment or an impeachment inquiry, compared to the 61 Democrats who do not yet support impeachment or impeachment inquiry. Pelosi has said she believes Trump is “goading” Democrats to impeach him because he thinks it will help him fire up his base.          Many of Pelosi’s Democratic colleagues have continued to push for impeaching Trump, such as Democratic Texas Rep. Al Green, who broke with Pelosi when he vowed to force a vote to impeach Trump in late March. Green, who previously had several bills to impeach Trump overwhelmingly rejected by the House of Representatives, called for a third impeachment vote. Pelosi said impeachment was “just not worth it” in a March interview.</td>\n",

       "      <td>'Democrats should be ashamed': White House admonishes House for moving forward with impeachment</td>\n",
       "      <td>White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham ridiculed the Democratic Party moments after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House of Representatives will move forward with a vote on impeaching President Trump.          On Thursday morning, Pelosi said that the House will draft up articles of impeachment as a result of President Trump's \"failure to faithfully execute the law.\" She added that they have gathered evidence from weeks of testimony in front of the House Intelligence Committee.          \"[Pelosi and] the Democrats should be ashamed. [Trump] has done nothing but lead our country - resulting in a booming economy, more jobs [and] a stronger military, to name just a few of his major accomplishments. We look forward to a fair trial in the Senate,\" Grisham tweeted.          Pelosi did not describe the impeachment articles or the timeline during her press conference, but Democrats have outlined a case that will likely focus on alleged abuses of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats are hoping to finish impeachment “expeditiously,” and are hoping to vote on the articles before the House adjourns for the year on December 20.          Democrats allege that Trump tried to bribe Ukraine government officials into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden by temporarily withholding $391 million in security aid until the investigation was agreed upon. The president has repeatedly denied the accusations and defended his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, which led to a whistleblower coming forward.          Trump weighed in preemptively on Twitter saying, \"The Do Nothing Democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the House. They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them, they have gone crazy. Therefore I say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair....\" He added in a subsequent tweet, \".....trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business. We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is. I was elected to “Clean the Swamp,” and that’s what I am doing!\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Marc Thiessen says Nancy Pelosi impeachment trial stalemate backfired: 'She has no leverage with Republicans'</td>\n",
       "      <td>Former White House speechwriter Marc Thiessen on Friday laid out how House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to withhold from the Senate articles of impeachment against President Trump has backfired. “Nancy Pelosi has a gun to her own head and is threatening to shoot, and Republicans should say, 'Make my day,'” Thiessen told “America’s Newsroom.”          TRUMP CALLS DEMS 'LIARS!' FOR DEEMING HIM SECURITY THREAT – AND THEN PAUSING IMPEACHMENT          Thiessen asserted that Pelosi does not have leverage with Republicans and noted popular support for impeachment has declined. If there was any Christmas truce between President Trump and Pelosi, it didn't last long. The president went so far Thursday morning as to suggest Pelosi should face a primary challenge, as he called her San Francisco district \"filthy\" and \"dirty\" and said she should focus on cleaning it up. Earlier Monday morning, the president tore into House Democrats over their handling of the impeachment process, calling them \"hypocrites\" and \"liars\" for allegedly seeking concessions in the Senate that Republicans were not afforded in the House -- and for hitting pause on impeachment after stressing the national security urgency of it all. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WHY IS PELOSI HOLDING THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT? DC INSIDERS HAVE SOME THEORIES          Despite this assessment, the impeachment process has stalled after Pelosi abruptly opted not to deliver articles of impeachment to the Senate, after the House adopted two articles alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for Trump's actions in Ukraine. Thiessen asserted that the House Democrats’ impeachment push backfired because popular support for removal of Trump declined. Thiessen went on to say, “That argument gets weaker every week that goes by that the articles haven’t impeached because, if you want unfairness, how about accusing the president of high crimes and misdemeanors and denying him a trial to defend himself.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mark Levin blasts Pelosi, Dems' 'rogue' push to impeach Trump</td>\n",
       "      <td>Mark Levin ripped House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for initiating an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, claiming she is going about the process in a rogue manner. Pelosi wrongfully quoted Ben Franklin, a signatory of the Constitution from Pennsylvania and otherwise accomplished little of substance through her remarks, Levin claimed Tuesday on \"The Mark Levin Show on Westwood One.\" \"She wouldn't take a vote on the House floor and she's in charge of scheduling... because she's still trying to protect 30, 40, 50 of her members,\" he said. \"One person from San Francisco -- one House district -- she has determined to launch a formal impeachment inquiry -- that's not what the Constitution calls for... Then, she cites the Constitution and Benjamin Franklin -- the same party that attacks the Constitution day in and day out, that attacks the... ratifiers of the Constitution day in and day out.\" He said that instead of bringing articles of impeachment to the House floor for a vote, she enlisted six committee chairs: Reps. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., Richard Neal, D-Mass., Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Maxine Waters, D-Calif., Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., to gather evidence and president it to herself and Nadler, who would make the ultimate determination on whether to hold an impeachment vote. \"She said... during the course of her mini-press-event that she is directing the six chairmen of these six committees to work together and provide their information to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler,\" he said. The \"Life, Liberty &amp; Levin\" host called the impeachment inquiry a \"pseudo-event in the un-reality that they created to humiliate the president.\" He added he believed the situation is little more than a campaign effort by Democrats hoping to undermine Trump's 2020 chances. \"It must be taken very seriously and it must be fought every step of the way,\" he said, adding the American people -- in the form of the full House -- should decide the future of the presidency and not a, \"rogue, radical Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.\"</td>\n",

       "302                                                     Trump vents over Pelosi impeachment push over Ukraine call  President Donald Trump cycled through a range of conflicting reactions Tuesday as Democrats moved swiftly toward concrete congressional action on impeachment.          The president moved from dismissing the renewed push by Democrats for impeachment proceedings early in the day to bemoaning the effort's impact while holding meetings with world leaders at the United Nations just a few hours later, to expressing social media outrage over \"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\" as evening fell.          \"Pelosi, Nadler, Schiff and, of course, Maxine Waters! Can you believe this?\" he asked in a late afternoon tweetstorm shortly after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry. By Wednesday morning, Trump lamented on Twitter that there \"has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have.\"          \"The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear,\" he continued, additionally calling the new impeachment push a \"Witch Hunt!\"          Meanwhile, the day's impeachment developments were being met inside his inner circle with a mix of trepidation and defiance, as the president and his allies entered what they acknowledged was uncharted territory, according to multiple sources familiar with their thinking.          Pelosi's move followed growing outrage among Democrats at Trump's reported pressure on Ukraine's president to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden while that country was awaiting U.S. aid he'd delayed, including a request during a summer phone call between the two leaders.          Early Tuesday, Trump dismissed the Democratic outrage as partisan posturing. “I think it’s a ridiculous witch hunt,” Trump said ahead of his morning remarks at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, reviving some of the same pushback he used during former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. “I’m leading in the polls. The only way they can stop me is impeachment.”          Download the medianame News app for breaking news and politics          As news broke later in the day that Pelosi planned to announce a formal impeachment inquiry, Trump said that he would release a transcript Wednesday morning.          \"You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,\" he tweeted. \"...This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\"          Democrats have called for the full release of a complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower that is said to include, but not be limited to, that call. A senior administration official said the White House was preparing to turn over the whistleblower complaint by this Thursday.          Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said a lawyer for the whistleblower had contacted his committee saying they would like to testify, and that the panel has requested guidance from the acting Director of National Intelligence on how to move forward.          Later Tuesday afternoon, ahead of a meeting by Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss potential action, the president accused the party of failing to take action on a range of issues, including gun safety, due to presidential investigations. “So bad for our Country!” he tweeted.          Then, during a meeting with the Iraqi president, he ran through a list of U.S. economic indicators, saying \"the country’s doing the best it’s ever done, and I just heard that [Pelosi would] like to impeach.\"          \"...If she does that, they all say that’s a positive for me in the election,\" he said. \"You could also say: who needs it, it’s bad for the country.”          Trump's damage control efforts on the domestic front Tuesday came as he looked to make his mark on the world stage, making a speech to the United Nations General Assembly and holding a string of meetings with world leaders.          \"Such an important day at the United Nations,\" he tweeted Tuesday afternoon, moments after Pelosi's announcement. \"So much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!\"          While Democrats have spent the last two years calling for various lines of impeachment, Pelosi is now triggering an official process that could translate to months of hearings, subpoenas and witness testimony — and, potentially, both new revelations and the passage of articles of impeachment as the president battles for re-election.          There is no indication yet that Trump could be removed from office, which would require a two-thirds vote from the Republican-led Senate.          More than two-thirds of House Democrats now back some type of impeachment action — still not enough to claim the simple House majority needed to pass articles of impeachment if the rest of the caucus does not go along, but a significant increase since last week.          On Monday, The Washington Post and other media outlets reported that Trump instructed his chief of staff to place a hold on $400 million in military aid for Ukraine in the days before a late July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.          Trump told reporters Tuesday that his request to withhold the aid was due to his desire to see greater European contributions to Ukraine’s defense, and not linked to whether the country would investigate the Biden family, which media outlets have reported Trump brought up on the call with Zelensky.          Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday he was never given an explanation for why the funds were being withheld, despite pressing senior administration officials about it at the time.          The White House has publicly sought to link the latest controversy — over whether Trump sought help from a foreign country to go after one of his chief political rivals — to the Russia election meddling investigation, which they have asserted exonerated the president, though it listed numerous instances of possible obstruction of justice.          “The media pushed the Russia lie for almost three years with no evidence, and now they are doing it all over again,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told medianame News in a statement Monday. “These allegations are completely false, but because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they’ll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this president.”          Trump's campaign has also argued that the latest effort is another attempt by the Democrats to overturn the 2016 election results.          \"They’ve always wanted to impeach him, and they’ve just been shopping around for an excuse,\" said Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh.          McConnell's reaction to the news late Tuesday echoed the White House's line of attack, accusing Democrats of “searching for ways to reverse their 2016 election defeat since before President Trump was even inaugurated and a \"rush to judgment\" and saying the move “simply confirms that House Democrats’ priority is not making life better for the American people but their nearly three-year-old fixation on impeachment.”          So did House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's. \"I realize 2016 did not turn out the way Speaker Pelosi wanted it to happen,\" said McCarthy, R-Calif. \"But she cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide we’re in an impeachment inquiry.\" House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, like the president, called the impeachment push a \"witch hunt\" that was being \"used to try to go and usurp the results of an election in 2016.\"          While sources close to the president said they didn’t want to see impeachment, they were prepared to argue it could be “helpful” in mobilizing the core supporters inside the president’s base.          Some allies predicted the move would backfire on Democrats, particularly if the transcript being released Wednesday failed to show a smoking gun — and the president’s campaign was already working to capitalize on the upcoming impeachment fight.          Over the course of several hours, the campaign sent multiple fundraising pitches to supporters, including the launch of an “Official Impeachment Defense Task Force.\" It also released a video attacking Democrats calling for impeachment, which Murtaugh said had been \"ready for weeks in case the Democrats were that dumb. And they were.”          Inside the White House, this round of impeachment talks was viewed as more politically perilous than during the Russia investigation, said one White House aide. Whether and how the White House is able to spin the transcript — and what the polling indicates over the next few days — will determine if this is yet another scandal to weather or a marked shift in public sentiment, the aide said.          Ahead of the Pelosi announcement, Republicans in Congress had been largely silent on the issue, with allies backing his allegations of corruption by Biden. The most critical GOP reaction came from Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who told medianame News Monday that Trump “should make available the whistleblower complaint that has been deemed to be credible and urgent.\"          \"I think it'd be very helpful to get the bottom of the facts,\" Romney said. \"If they don't, it will be up to the House to decide how to proceed.”\n",

she came out in favor of the impeachment of President Donald Trump for the first time Tuesday after meeting with her caucus.          In a Tuesday night press conference on Capitol Hill, McCarthy said Pelosi’s calls for impeachment are due to the Democrats losing the presidency in 2016, saying this is proof they have not yet got over the election. McCarthy also said their job is to legislate, not to continue to find dirt on the President.          “This election is over. I realize 2016 did not turn out the way Speaker Pelosi wanted it to happen. But she cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide when an impeachment inquiry,” McCarthy said to reporters. What she said today made no difference of what’s been going on.” (RELATED: Nancy Pelosi Comes Out In Favor Of Impeachment)          Pelosi then publicly announced late Tuesday afternoon, “Today I’m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.” (RELATED: McCarthy Meets With US Trade Rep Robert Lighthizer About USMCA)          Despite Pelosi’s early reluctance to push for impeachment, there are currently 174 Democrats who support impeachment or an impeachment inquiry, compared to the 61 Democrats who do not yet support impeachment or impeachment inquiry. Pelosi has said she believes Trump is “goading” Democrats to impeach him because he thinks it will help him fire up his base.          Many of Pelosi’s Democratic colleagues have continued to push for impeaching Trump, such as Democratic Texas Rep. Al Green, who broke with Pelosi when he vowed to force a vote to impeach Trump in late March. Green, who previously had several bills to impeach Trump overwhelmingly rejected by the House of Representatives, called for a third impeachment vote. Pelosi said impeachment was “just not worth it” in a March interview.\n",

of Representatives will move forward with a vote on impeaching President Trump.          On Thursday morning, Pelosi said that the House will draft up articles of impeachment as a result of President Trump's \"failure to faithfully execute the law.\" She added that they have gathered evidence from weeks of testimony in front of the House Intelligence Committee.          \"[Pelosi and] the Democrats should be ashamed. [Trump] has done nothing but lead our country - resulting in a booming economy, more jobs [and] a stronger military, to name just a few of his major accomplishments. We look forward to a fair trial in the Senate,\" Grisham tweeted.          Pelosi did not describe the impeachment articles or the timeline during her press conference, but Democrats have outlined a case that will likely focus on alleged abuses of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats are hoping to finish impeachment “expeditiously,” and are hoping to vote on the articles before the House adjourns for the year on December 20.          Democrats allege that Trump tried to bribe Ukraine government officials into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden by temporarily withholding $391 million in security aid until the investigation was agreed upon. The president has repeatedly denied the accusations and defended his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, which led to a whistleblower coming forward.          Trump weighed in preemptively on Twitter saying, \"The Do Nothing Democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the House. They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them, they have gone crazy. Therefore I say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair....\" He added in a subsequent tweet, \".....trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business. We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is. I was elected to “Clean the Swamp,” and that’s what I am doing!\"\n",

withhold from the Senate articles of impeachment against President Trump has backfired. “Nancy Pelosi has a gun to her own head and is threatening to shoot, and Republicans should say, 'Make my day,'” Thiessen told “America’s Newsroom.”          TRUMP CALLS DEMS 'LIARS!' FOR DEEMING HIM SECURITY THREAT – AND THEN PAUSING IMPEACHMENT          Thiessen asserted that Pelosi does not have leverage with Republicans and noted popular support for impeachment has declined. If there was any Christmas truce between President Trump and Pelosi, it didn't last long. The president went so far Thursday morning as to suggest Pelosi should face a primary challenge, as he called her San Francisco district \"filthy\" and \"dirty\" and said she should focus on cleaning it up. Earlier Monday morning, the president tore into House Democrats over their handling of the impeachment process, calling them \"hypocrites\" and \"liars\" for allegedly seeking concessions in the Senate that Republicans were not afforded in the House -- and for hitting pause on impeachment after stressing the national security urgency of it all. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WHY IS PELOSI HOLDING THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT? DC INSIDERS HAVE SOME THEORIES          Despite this assessment, the impeachment process has stalled after Pelosi abruptly opted not to deliver articles of impeachment to the Senate, after the House adopted two articles alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for Trump's actions in Ukraine. Thiessen asserted that the House Democrats’ impeachment push backfired because popular support for removal of Trump declined. Thiessen went on to say, “That argument gets weaker every week that goes by that the articles haven’t impeached because, if you want unfairness, how about accusing the president of high crimes and misdemeanors and denying him a trial to defend himself.”\n",

Pelosi, D-Calif., for initiating an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, claiming she is going about the process in a rogue manner. Pelosi wrongfully quoted Ben Franklin, a signatory of the Constitution from Pennsylvania and otherwise accomplished little of substance through her remarks, Levin claimed Tuesday on \"The Mark Levin Show on Westwood One.\" \"She wouldn't take a vote on the House floor and she's in charge of scheduling... because she's still trying to protect 30, 40, 50 of her members,\" he said. \"One person from San Francisco -- one House district -- she has determined to launch a formal impeachment inquiry -- that's not what the Constitution calls for... Then, she cites the Constitution and Benjamin Franklin -- the same party that attacks the Constitution day in and day out, that attacks the... ratifiers of the Constitution day in and day out.\" He said that instead of bringing articles of impeachment to the House floor for a vote, she enlisted six committee chairs: Reps. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., Richard Neal, D-Mass., Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Maxine Waters, D-Calif., Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., to gather evidence and president it to herself and Nadler, who would make the ultimate determination on whether to hold an impeachment vote. \"She said... during the course of her mini-press-event that she is directing the six chairmen of these six committees to work together and provide their information to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler,\" he said. The \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" host called the impeachment inquiry a \"pseudo-event in the un-reality that they created to humiliate the president.\" He added he believed the situation is little more than a campaign effort by Democrats hoping to undermine Trump's 2020 chances. \"It must be taken very seriously and it must be fought every step of the way,\" he said, adding the American people -- in the form of the full House -- should decide the future of the presidency and not a, \"rogue, radical Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.\""

       "      <td>Liz Cheney on Ukraine: 'Starting to Seem Like a Political Setup'</td>\n",
       "      <td>Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) on Monday said an intelligence official’s complaint that President Trump sought help from Ukraine in the 2020 elections “is starting to seem like a political setup.”          Cheney tweeted a clip of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) appearing to admit she knew what was in the transcript of a July 25 Trump phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky even before the White House released the transcript of the call last Wednesday.          Pelosi, in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS News 60 Minutes, said Trump called her and they discussed the phone call before the transcript was released.          According to the New York Times, Trump and Pelosi’s phone call took place on Tuesday. The White House released the transcript on Wednesday.          But Pelosi said during the interview about her call with Trump, “He told me it was perfect. There was nothing in the call. But I know what was in the call. I mean, we — it was in the public domain.”          When Trump and Pelosi had spoken Tuesday, the call was not yet “in the public domain.”          Fred Fleitz, a former CIA analyst and chief of staff to former National Security Adviser John Bolton, has questioned whether the intelligence official who lodged a whistleblower complaint against Trump had help writing the complaint from Democrat lawmakers or their staff members.          He wrote in a New York Post op-ed on Thursday:          I am very familiar with transcripts of presidential phone calls since I edited and processed dozens of them when I worked for the NSC. I also know a lot about intelligence whistleblowers from my time with the CIA. My suspicions grew this morning when I saw the declassified whistleblowing complaint. It appears to be written by a law professor and includes legal references and detailed footnotes. It also has an unusual legalistic reference on how this complaint should be classified. From my experience, such an extremely polished whistleblowing complaint is unheard of. This document looks as if this leaker had outside help, possibly from congressional members or staff. Moreover, it looks like more than a coincidence that this complaint surfaced and was directed to the House Intelligence Committee just after Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), an outspoken opponent of President Trump, expressed numerous complaints in August 2019 accusing President Trump of abusing aid to Ukraine to hurt Joe Biden. This includes an August 28 tweet that closely resembled the whistleblowing complaint. House Republicans need to ask the whistleblower under oath whether he spoke to the press or Congress about his complaint.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trump Snaps At Biden, Pelosi Over Coronavirus Criticism: ‘These People Are Sick’</td>\n",
       "      <td>President Donald Trump criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Vice President Joe Biden Friday during a White House Memorial Day ceremony.          The president called Pelosi and Biden “sick” over their criticism of his coronavirus response, pointing to his decision to ban travel from China in late January. (RELATED: ‘Hell Yes’: Over 200 Democrats Stand By ‘NO BAN Act’ Amid Coronavirus Pandemic)          “I put a ban on China in January, and I took a lot of heat,” Trump said. “Joe Biden said, ‘oh, he’s xenophobic.’ Oh that’s right, yeah. But a month later he said I was right. As you know, Dr. Fauci, a good guy said ‘you don’t need to do that,’ and then later on when he saw that I did it, and when we kept thousands, tens of thousands of people out, he said, ‘Donald Trump saved thousands of lives, tens of thousands of lives.'”          The president also went after Pelosi over her late February appearance in San Francisco’s Chinatown, where the speaker encouraged people to come out and patron businesses in the area. (RELATED: FLASHBACK: Jan.21: Fauci Says Coronavirus ‘Not A Major Threat’ To U.S.)          “Nancy Pelosi, a month later, was in Chinatown in San Francisco.

Bring your infection with you,’ and then she said ‘he should’ve done it earlier’ about me, and she’s dancing a month later,” Trump said. “These people are sick.”          The president’s comments follow a week of back and forth insults, where Pelosi referred to Trump as “morbidly obese,” and the president responded by dismissing the speaker as a “waste of time.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Nancy Pelosi began the impeachment debate Wednesday afternoon with a wretchedly written speech proclaiming herself \"solemn\" and \"sad,\" and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.          As unwoke as it is to recite the Pledge (probably racist by the Left's current rules), what's truly shocking is that Pelosi didn't bother to prepare anything substantive or even any compelling rhetoric for her speech. If you literally begin your speech about impeachment by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, it means that you assigned your junior speechwriter to write this speech, probably the night before.          Grave moments call upon leaders to make serious arguments — to make their oratory match the moment. That can be done in many ways. Lincoln did it at Gettysburg with honest gravity and brevity. Reagan did it at the Brandenburg Gate with directness. Churchill, Kennedy, and the other leaders of last century, who faced actually \"solemn\" moments, rose to the occasion by injecting poetry, originality, and eloquence.          Pelosi, in contrast, kicked off her supposedly grave impeachment with a string of half-relevant quotations and piles and piles of melodrama (at one point she uttered the words \"dancing with angels\"). Her party responded with forced applause.          It was a shoddy speech to begin a rushed and shoddy impeachment process.          There are tons of problems with the Trump administration, including President Trump's use of the federal government to enrich his own business. But this isn't about any actual misconduct. Democrats arrived for this Congress on Day One promising to impeach Trump. They failed in their first effort when the Mueller report came up empty, and ever since, they have been scrambling for another reason to do what they were going to do anyway. As a result, they find themselves in the role of the kid who had to do his homework assignment on the bus ride to school.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Neal: Democrats, Lighthizer have resolved some USMCA issues</td>\n",
       "      <td>Neal did not specify which areas had been worked out but said the administration and lawmakers’ staff members will work intensely over the two-week congressional break. The goal is that when lawmakers return to Washington they’ll be able to see “the goal line,” Neal said.          Neal also indicated that USTR’s reaction this morning to Democrats’ counteroffer was “favorable.” But he noted that “they still have to digest it.” USTR officials could not be immediately reached for comment.          House Democrats and Lighthizer have been in formal talks since June to strike a deal that would allow for Speaker Nancy Pelosi to put the USMCA up for a vote. Pelosi, for her part, reiterated Thursday that Democrats remained on a “continued path to yes.”          “There is progress being made,” Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), one of the working group members, adding in a baseball reference that he feels negotiations are \"entering the sixth inning.\"          But he said there are still worries — separate from negotiations with the Trump administration — about whether Mexico will follow through on implementing its landmark labor reform law. Lawmakers are concerned that Mexico’s proposed annual budget does not reflect the amount needed for the required changes.          “This has never been viewed as a slam dunk,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), a member of the working group. “But I think what’s important is that if we weren’t [working to get to yes] we wouldn’t be continuing to meet.”          The Trump administration, Republicans and business groups are pushing for USMCA to be put up for a vote in Congress this fall. Democrats have said they hope that they’ll be able to get a deal done this year, even as the House dives into an impeachment inquiry.          Asked if the goal remained to pass USMCA this year, Neal said yes.          “I wouldn’t say we’re on the precipice, but the job is to get to the precipice but not over the edge,” Neal said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Nancy Pelosi’s revenge: Trump is ‘impeached for life’</td>\n",
       "      <td>In between the insistence on impeachment as a dire national security issue and then the holding of the articles, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave a slight hint into why she’s been going gung-ho for so long, so viciously, yet so utterly devoid and defiant of facts, against President Donald Trump: It’s personal. It’s Pelosi’s way of marking this president for life. “This president is impeached for life regardless of any gamesmanship on the part of Mitch McConnell,” she said on “This Week” on ABC. A few moments later, she added, “There is nothing the Senate can do that can ever erase that.”          What an odd little quip. It’s the type of thing a scorned woman might say of a cheating husband after a nasty divorce that didn’t exactly go her way: “Well, at least his reputation is tainted.” Or: “At least his coworkers know what a piece of [bleep] he is.”          Twitter was quick to pick up on the strangeness, too, trending #ImpeachedForLife shortly after her comments. But Pelosi’s remarks are illuminating because they underscore her personal distaste for Trump the man, as well as Trump the president. They say, ha ha, you may have won with a Republican-dominated Senate, but you haven’t won in the history books. In the end, in Pelosi’s mind, she gets her revenge. But really, that’s hardly a demeanor fitting a speaker. And it’s certainly not an attitude that serves the American people and the Constitution well — or first.

       "7                    Liz Cheney on Ukraine: 'Starting to Seem Like a Political Setup'  Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) on Monday said an intelligence official’s complaint that President Trump sought help from Ukraine in the 2020 elections “is starting to seem like a political setup.”          Cheney tweeted a clip of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) appearing to admit she knew what was in the transcript of a July 25 Trump phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky even before the White House released the transcript of the call last Wednesday.          Pelosi, in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS News 60 Minutes, said Trump called her and they discussed the phone call before the transcript was released.          According to the New York Times, Trump and Pelosi’s phone call took place on Tuesday. The White House released the transcript on Wednesday.          But Pelosi said during the interview about her call with Trump, “He told me it was perfect. There was nothing in the call. But I know what was in the call. I mean, we — it was in the public domain.”          When Trump and Pelosi had spoken Tuesday, the call was not yet “in the public domain.”          Fred Fleitz, a former CIA analyst and chief of staff to former National Security Adviser John Bolton, has questioned whether the intelligence official who lodged a whistleblower complaint against Trump had help writing the complaint from Democrat lawmakers or their staff members.          He wrote in a New York Post op-ed on Thursday:          I am very familiar with transcripts of presidential phone calls since I edited and processed dozens of them when I worked for the NSC. I also know a lot about intelligence whistleblowers from my time with the CIA. My suspicions grew this morning when I saw the declassified whistleblowing complaint. It appears to be written by a law professor and includes legal references and detailed footnotes. It also has an unusual legalistic reference on how this complaint should be classified. From my experience, such an extremely polished whistleblowing complaint is unheard of. This document looks as if this leaker had outside help, possibly from congressional members or staff. Moreover, it looks like more than a coincidence that this complaint surfaced and was directed to the House Intelligence Committee just after Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), an outspoken opponent of President Trump, expressed numerous complaints in August 2019 accusing President Trump of abusing aid to Ukraine to hurt Joe Biden. This includes an August 28 tweet that closely resembled the whistleblowing complaint. House Republicans need to ask the whistleblower under oath whether he spoke to the press or Congress about his complaint.\n",

       "254                       Neal: Democrats, Lighthizer have resolved some USMCA issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Neal did not specify which areas had been worked out but said the administration and lawmakers’ staff members will work intensely over the two-week congressional break. The goal is that when lawmakers return to Washington they’ll be able to see “the goal line,” Neal said.          Neal also indicated that USTR’s reaction this morning to Democrats’ counteroffer was “favorable.” But he noted that “they still have to digest it.” USTR officials could not be immediately reached for comment.          House Democrats and Lighthizer have been in formal talks since June to strike a deal that would allow for Speaker Nancy Pelosi to put the USMCA up for a vote. Pelosi, for her part, reiterated Thursday that Democrats remained on a “continued path to yes.”          “There is progress being made,” Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), one of the working group members, adding in a baseball reference that he feels negotiations are \"entering the sixth inning.\"          But he said there are still worries — separate from negotiations with the Trump administration — about whether Mexico will follow through on implementing its landmark labor reform law. Lawmakers are concerned that Mexico’s proposed annual budget does not reflect the amount needed for the required changes.          “This has never been viewed as a slam dunk,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), a member of the working group. “But I think what’s important is that if we weren’t [working to get to yes] we wouldn’t be continuing to meet.”          The Trump administration, Republicans and business groups are pushing for USMCA to be put up for a vote in Congress this fall. Democrats have said they hope that they’ll be able to get a deal done this year, even as the House dives into an impeachment inquiry.          Asked if the goal remained to pass USMCA this year, Neal said yes.          “I wouldn’t say we’re on the precipice, but the job is to get to the precipice but not over the edge,” Neal said.\n",

It’s Pelosi’s way of marking this president for life. “This president is impeached for life regardless of any gamesmanship on the part of Mitch McConnell,” she said on “This Week” on ABC. A few moments later, she added, “There is nothing the Senate can do that can ever erase that.”          What an odd little quip. It’s the type of thing a scorned woman might say of a cheating husband after a nasty divorce that didn’t exactly go her way: “Well, at least his reputation is tainted.” Or: “At least his coworkers know what a piece of [bleep] he is.”          Twitter was quick to pick up on the strangeness, too, trending #ImpeachedForLife shortly after her comments. But Pelosi’s remarks are illuminating because they underscore her personal distaste for Trump the man, as well as Trump the president. They say, ha ha, you may have won with a Republican-dominated Senate, but you haven’t won in the history books. In the end, in Pelosi’s mind, she gets her revenge. But really, that’s hardly a demeanor fitting a speaker. And it’s certainly not an attitude that serves the American people and the Constitution well — or first.

       "      <td>President Donald Trump cycled through a range of conflicting reactions Tuesday as Democrats moved swiftly toward concrete congressional action on impeachment.          The president moved from dismissing the renewed push by Democrats for impeachment proceedings early in the day to bemoaning the effort's impact while holding meetings with world leaders at the United Nations just a few hours later, to expressing social media outrage over \"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\" as evening fell.          \"Pelosi, Nadler, Schiff and, of course, Maxine Waters! Can you believe this?\" he asked in a late afternoon tweetstorm shortly after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry. By Wednesday morning, Trump lamented on Twitter that there \"has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have.\"          \"The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear,\" he continued, additionally calling the new impeachment push a \"Witch Hunt!\"          Meanwhile, the day's impeachment developments were being met inside his inner circle with a mix of trepidation and defiance, as the president and his allies entered what they acknowledged was uncharted territory, according to multiple sources familiar with their thinking.          Pelosi's move followed growing outrage among Democrats at Trump's reported pressure on Ukraine's president to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden while that country was awaiting U.S. aid he'd delayed, including a request during a summer phone call between the two leaders.          Early Tuesday, Trump dismissed the Democratic outrage as partisan posturing. “I think it’s a ridiculous witch hunt,” Trump said ahead of his morning remarks at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, reviving some of the same pushback he used during former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. “I’m leading in the polls. The only way they can stop me is impeachment.”          Download the medianame News app for breaking news and politics          As news broke later in the day that Pelosi planned to announce a formal impeachment inquiry, Trump said that he would release a transcript Wednesday morning.          \"You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,\" he tweeted. \"...This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\"          Democrats have called for the full release of a complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower that is said to include, but not be limited to, that call. A senior administration official said the White House was preparing to turn over the whistleblower complaint by this Thursday.          Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said a lawyer for the whistleblower had contacted his committee saying they would like to testify, and that the panel has requested guidance from the acting Director of National Intelligence on how to move forward.          Later Tuesday afternoon, ahead of a meeting by Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss potential action, the president accused the party of failing to take action on a range of issues, including gun safety, due to presidential investigations. “So bad for our Country!” he tweeted.          Then, during a meeting with the Iraqi president, he ran through a list of U.S. economic indicators, saying \"the country’s doing the best it’s ever done, and I just heard that [Pelosi would] like to impeach.\"          \"...If she does that, they all say that’s a positive for me in the election,\" he said. \"You could also say: who needs it, it’s bad for the country.”          Trump's damage control efforts on the domestic front Tuesday came as he looked to make his mark on the world stage, making a speech to the United Nations General Assembly and holding a string of meetings with world leaders.          \"Such an important day at the United Nations,\" he tweeted Tuesday afternoon, moments after Pelosi's announcement. \"So much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!\"          While Democrats have spent the last two years calling for various lines of impeachment, Pelosi is now triggering an official process that could translate to months of hearings, subpoenas and witness testimony — and, potentially, both new revelations and the passage of articles of impeachment as the president battles for re-election.          There is no indication yet that Trump could be removed from office, which would require a two-thirds vote from the Republican-led Senate.          More than two-thirds of House Democrats now back some type of impeachment action — still not enough to claim the simple House majority needed to pass articles of impeachment if the rest of the caucus does not go along, but a significant increase since last week.          On Monday, The Washington Post and other media outlets reported that Trump instructed his chief of staff to place a hold on $400 million in military aid for Ukraine in the days before a late July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.          Trump told reporters Tuesday that his request to withhold the aid was due to his desire to see greater European contributions to Ukraine’s defense, and not linked to whether the country would investigate the Biden family, which media outlets have reported Trump brought up on the call with Zelensky.          Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday he was never given an explanation for why the funds were being withheld, despite pressing senior administration officials about it at the time.          The White House has publicly sought to link the latest controversy — over whether Trump sought help from a foreign country to go after one of his chief political rivals — to the Russia election meddling investigation, which they have asserted exonerated the president, though it listed numerous instances of possible obstruction of justice.          “The media pushed the Russia lie for almost three years with no evidence, and now they are doing it all over again,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told medianame News in a statement Monday. “These allegations are completely false, but because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they’ll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this president.”          Trump's campaign has also argued that the latest effort is another attempt by the Democrats to overturn the 2016 election results.          \"They’ve always wanted to impeach him, and they’ve just been shopping around for an excuse,\" said Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh.          McConnell's reaction to the news late Tuesday echoed the White House's line of attack, accusing Democrats of “searching for ways to reverse their 2016 election defeat since before President Trump was even inaugurated and a \"rush to judgment\" and saying the move “simply confirms that House Democrats’ priority is not making life better for the American people but their nearly three-year-old fixation on impeachment.”          So did House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's. \"I realize 2016 did not turn out the way Speaker Pelosi wanted it to happen,\" said McCarthy, R-Calif. \"But she cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide we’re in an impeachment inquiry.\" House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, like the president, called the impeachment push a \"witch hunt\" that was being \"used to try to go and usurp the results of an election in 2016.\"          While sources close to the president said they didn’t want to see impeachment, they were prepared to argue it could be “helpful” in mobilizing the core supporters inside the president’s base.          Some allies predicted the move would backfire on Democrats, particularly if the transcript being released Wednesday failed to show a smoking gun — and the president’s campaign was already working to capitalize on the upcoming impeachment fight.          Over the course of several hours, the campaign sent multiple fundraising pitches to supporters, including the launch of an “Official Impeachment Defense Task Force.\" It also released a video attacking Democrats calling for impeachment, which Murtaugh said had been \"ready for weeks in case the Democrats were that dumb. And they were.”          Inside the White House, this round of impeachment talks was viewed as more politically perilous than during the Russia investigation, said one White House aide. Whether and how the White House is able to spin the transcript — and what the polling indicates over the next few days — will determine if this is yet another scandal to weather or a marked shift in public sentiment, the aide said.          Ahead of the Pelosi announcement, Republicans in Congress had been largely silent on the issue, with allies backing his allegations of corruption by Biden. The most critical GOP reaction came from Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who told medianame News Monday that Trump “should make available the whistleblower complaint that has been deemed to be credible and urgent.\"          \"I think it'd be very helpful to get the bottom of the facts,\" Romney said. \"If they don't, it will be up to the House to decide how to proceed.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>McCarthy Fires Back At Pelosi After Impeachment Calls: ‘Cannot Change The Laws’</td>\n",
       "      <td>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy fired back at Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi after she came out in favor of the impeachment of President Donald Trump for the first time Tuesday after meeting with her caucus.          In a Tuesday night press conference on Capitol Hill, McCarthy said Pelosi’s calls for impeachment are due to the Democrats losing the presidency in 2016, saying this is proof they have not yet got over the election. McCarthy also said their job is to legislate, not to continue to find dirt on the President.          “This election is over. I realize 2016 did not turn out the way Speaker Pelosi wanted it to happen. But she cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide when an impeachment inquiry,” McCarthy said to reporters. What she said today made no difference of what’s been going on.” (RELATED: Nancy Pelosi Comes Out In Favor Of Impeachment)          Pelosi then publicly announced late Tuesday afternoon, “Today I’m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.” (RELATED: McCarthy Meets With US Trade Rep Robert Lighthizer About USMCA)          Despite Pelosi’s early reluctance to push for impeachment, there are currently 174 Democrats who support impeachment or an impeachment inquiry, compared to the 61 Democrats who do not yet support impeachment or impeachment inquiry. Pelosi has said she believes Trump is “goading” Democrats to impeach him because he thinks it will help him fire up his base.          Many of Pelosi’s Democratic colleagues have continued to push for impeaching Trump, such as Democratic Texas Rep. Al Green, who broke with Pelosi when he vowed to force a vote to impeach Trump in late March. Green, who previously had several bills to impeach Trump overwhelmingly rejected by the House of Representatives, called for a third impeachment vote. Pelosi said impeachment was “just not worth it” in a March interview.</td>\n",

       "      <td>White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham ridiculed the Democratic Party moments after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House of Representatives will move forward with a vote on impeaching President Trump.          On Thursday morning, Pelosi said that the House will draft up articles of impeachment as a result of President Trump's \"failure to faithfully execute the law.\" She added that they have gathered evidence from weeks of testimony in front of the House Intelligence Committee.          \"[Pelosi and] the Democrats should be ashamed. [Trump] has done nothing but lead our country - resulting in a booming economy, more jobs [and] a stronger military, to name just a few of his major accomplishments. We look forward to a fair trial in the Senate,\" Grisham tweeted.          Pelosi did not describe the impeachment articles or the timeline during her press conference, but Democrats have outlined a case that will likely focus on alleged abuses of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats are hoping to finish impeachment “expeditiously,” and are hoping to vote on the articles before the House adjourns for the year on December 20.          Democrats allege that Trump tried to bribe Ukraine government officials into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden by temporarily withholding $391 million in security aid until the investigation was agreed upon. The president has repeatedly denied the accusations and defended his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, which led to a whistleblower coming forward.          Trump weighed in preemptively on Twitter saying, \"The Do Nothing Democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the House. They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them, they have gone crazy. Therefore I say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair....\" He added in a subsequent tweet, \".....trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business. We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is. I was elected to “Clean the Swamp,” and that’s what I am doing!\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Former White House speechwriter Marc Thiessen on Friday laid out how House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to withhold from the Senate articles of impeachment against President Trump has backfired. “Nancy Pelosi has a gun to her own head and is threatening to shoot, and Republicans should say, 'Make my day,'” Thiessen told “America’s Newsroom.”          TRUMP CALLS DEMS 'LIARS!' FOR DEEMING HIM SECURITY THREAT – AND THEN PAUSING IMPEACHMENT          Thiessen asserted that Pelosi does not have leverage with Republicans and noted popular support for impeachment has declined. If there was any Christmas truce between President Trump and Pelosi, it didn't last long. The president went so far Thursday morning as to suggest Pelosi should face a primary challenge, as he called her San Francisco district \"filthy\" and \"dirty\" and said she should focus on cleaning it up. Earlier Monday morning, the president tore into House Democrats over their handling of the impeachment process, calling them \"hypocrites\" and \"liars\" for allegedly seeking concessions in the Senate that Republicans were not afforded in the House -- and for hitting pause on impeachment after stressing the national security urgency of it all. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WHY IS PELOSI HOLDING THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT? DC INSIDERS HAVE SOME THEORIES          Despite this assessment, the impeachment process has stalled after Pelosi abruptly opted not to deliver articles of impeachment to the Senate, after the House adopted two articles alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for Trump's actions in Ukraine. Thiessen asserted that the House Democrats’ impeachment push backfired because popular support for removal of Trump declined. Thiessen went on to say, “That argument gets weaker every week that goes by that the articles haven’t impeached because, if you want unfairness, how about accusing the president of high crimes and misdemeanors and denying him a trial to defend himself.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mark Levin ripped House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for initiating an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, claiming she is going about the process in a rogue manner. Pelosi wrongfully quoted Ben Franklin, a signatory of the Constitution from Pennsylvania and otherwise accomplished little of substance through her remarks, Levin claimed Tuesday on \"The Mark Levin Show on Westwood One.\" \"She wouldn't take a vote on the House floor and she's in charge of scheduling... because she's still trying to protect 30, 40, 50 of her members,\" he said. \"One person from San Francisco -- one House district -- she has determined to launch a formal impeachment inquiry -- that's not what the Constitution calls for... Then, she cites the Constitution and Benjamin Franklin -- the same party that attacks the Constitution day in and day out, that attacks the... ratifiers of the Constitution day in and day out.\" He said that instead of bringing articles of impeachment to the House floor for a vote, she enlisted six committee chairs: Reps. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., Richard Neal, D-Mass., Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Maxine Waters, D-Calif., Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., to gather evidence and president it to herself and Nadler, who would make the ultimate determination on whether to hold an impeachment vote. \"She said... during the course of her mini-press-event that she is directing the six chairmen of these six committees to work together and provide their information to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler,\" he said. The \"Life, Liberty &amp; Levin\" host called the impeachment inquiry a \"pseudo-event in the un-reality that they created to humiliate the president.\" He added he believed the situation is little more than a campaign effort by Democrats hoping to undermine Trump's 2020 chances. \"It must be taken very seriously and it must be fought every step of the way,\" he said, adding the American people -- in the form of the full House -- should decide the future of the presidency and not a, \"rogue, radical Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.\"</td>\n",

       "302                                                     Trump vents over Pelosi impeachment push over Ukraine call  President Donald Trump cycled through a range of conflicting reactions Tuesday as Democrats moved swiftly toward concrete congressional action on impeachment.          The president moved from dismissing the renewed push by Democrats for impeachment proceedings early in the day to bemoaning the effort's impact while holding meetings with world leaders at the United Nations just a few hours later, to expressing social media outrage over \"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\" as evening fell.          \"Pelosi, Nadler, Schiff and, of course, Maxine Waters! Can you believe this?\" he asked in a late afternoon tweetstorm shortly after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry. By Wednesday morning, Trump lamented on Twitter that there \"has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have.\"          \"The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear,\" he continued, additionally calling the new impeachment push a \"Witch Hunt!\"          Meanwhile, the day's impeachment developments were being met inside his inner circle with a mix of trepidation and defiance, as the president and his allies entered what they acknowledged was uncharted territory, according to multiple sources familiar with their thinking.          Pelosi's move followed growing outrage among Democrats at Trump's reported pressure on Ukraine's president to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden while that country was awaiting U.S. aid he'd delayed, including a request during a summer phone call between the two leaders.          Early Tuesday, Trump dismissed the Democratic outrage as partisan posturing. “I think it’s a ridiculous witch hunt,” Trump said ahead of his morning remarks at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, reviving some of the same pushback he used during former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. “I’m leading in the polls. The only way they can stop me is impeachment.”          Download the medianame News app for breaking news and politics          As news broke later in the day that Pelosi planned to announce a formal impeachment inquiry, Trump said that he would release a transcript Wednesday morning.          \"You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,\" he tweeted. \"...This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\"          Democrats have called for the full release of a complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower that is said to include, but not be limited to, that call. A senior administration official said the White House was preparing to turn over the whistleblower complaint by this Thursday.          Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said a lawyer for the whistleblower had contacted his committee saying they would like to testify, and that the panel has requested guidance from the acting Director of National Intelligence on how to move forward.          Later Tuesday afternoon, ahead of a meeting by Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss potential action, the president accused the party of failing to take action on a range of issues, including gun safety, due to presidential investigations. “So bad for our Country!” he tweeted.          Then, during a meeting with the Iraqi president, he ran through a list of U.S. economic indicators, saying \"the country’s doing the best it’s ever done, and I just heard that [Pelosi would] like to impeach.\"          \"...If she does that, they all say that’s a positive for me in the election,\" he said. \"You could also say: who needs it, it’s bad for the country.”          Trump's damage control efforts on the domestic front Tuesday came as he looked to make his mark on the world stage, making a speech to the United Nations General Assembly and holding a string of meetings with world leaders.          \"Such an important day at the United Nations,\" he tweeted Tuesday afternoon, moments after Pelosi's announcement. \"So much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!\"          While Democrats have spent the last two years calling for various lines of impeachment, Pelosi is now triggering an official process that could translate to months of hearings, subpoenas and witness testimony — and, potentially, both new revelations and the passage of articles of impeachment as the president battles for re-election.          There is no indication yet that Trump could be removed from office, which would require a two-thirds vote from the Republican-led Senate.          More than two-thirds of House Democrats now back some type of impeachment action — still not enough to claim the simple House majority needed to pass articles of impeachment if the rest of the caucus does not go along, but a significant increase since last week.          On Monday, The Washington Post and other media outlets reported that Trump instructed his chief of staff to place a hold on $400 million in military aid for Ukraine in the days before a late July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.          Trump told reporters Tuesday that his request to withhold the aid was due to his desire to see greater European contributions to Ukraine’s defense, and not linked to whether the country would investigate the Biden family, which media outlets have reported Trump brought up on the call with Zelensky.          Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday he was never given an explanation for why the funds were being withheld, despite pressing senior administration officials about it at the time.          The White House has publicly sought to link the latest controversy — over whether Trump sought help from a foreign country to go after one of his chief political rivals — to the Russia election meddling investigation, which they have asserted exonerated the president, though it listed numerous instances of possible obstruction of justice.          “The media pushed the Russia lie for almost three years with no evidence, and now they are doing it all over again,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told medianame News in a statement Monday. “These allegations are completely false, but because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they’ll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this president.”          Trump's campaign has also argued that the latest effort is another attempt by the Democrats to overturn the 2016 election results.          \"They’ve always wanted to impeach him, and they’ve just been shopping around for an excuse,\" said Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh.          McConnell's reaction to the news late Tuesday echoed the White House's line of attack, accusing Democrats of “searching for ways to reverse their 2016 election defeat since before President Trump was even inaugurated and a \"rush to judgment\" and saying the move “simply confirms that House Democrats’ priority is not making life better for the American people but their nearly three-year-old fixation on impeachment.”          So did House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's. \"I realize 2016 did not turn out the way Speaker Pelosi wanted it to happen,\" said McCarthy, R-Calif. \"But she cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide we’re in an impeachment inquiry.\" House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, like the president, called the impeachment push a \"witch hunt\" that was being \"used to try to go and usurp the results of an election in 2016.\"          While sources close to the president said they didn’t want to see impeachment, they were prepared to argue it could be “helpful” in mobilizing the core supporters inside the president’s base.          Some allies predicted the move would backfire on Democrats, particularly if the transcript being released Wednesday failed to show a smoking gun — and the president’s campaign was already working to capitalize on the upcoming impeachment fight.          Over the course of several hours, the campaign sent multiple fundraising pitches to supporters, including the launch of an “Official Impeachment Defense Task Force.\" It also released a video attacking Democrats calling for impeachment, which Murtaugh said had been \"ready for weeks in case the Democrats were that dumb. And they were.”          Inside the White House, this round of impeachment talks was viewed as more politically perilous than during the Russia investigation, said one White House aide. Whether and how the White House is able to spin the transcript — and what the polling indicates over the next few days — will determine if this is yet another scandal to weather or a marked shift in public sentiment, the aide said.          Ahead of the Pelosi announcement, Republicans in Congress had been largely silent on the issue, with allies backing his allegations of corruption by Biden. The most critical GOP reaction came from Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who told medianame News Monday that Trump “should make available the whistleblower complaint that has been deemed to be credible and urgent.\"          \"I think it'd be very helpful to get the bottom of the facts,\" Romney said. \"If they don't, it will be up to the House to decide how to proceed.”\n",

she came out in favor of the impeachment of President Donald Trump for the first time Tuesday after meeting with her caucus.          In a Tuesday night press conference on Capitol Hill, McCarthy said Pelosi’s calls for impeachment are due to the Democrats losing the presidency in 2016, saying this is proof they have not yet got over the election. McCarthy also said their job is to legislate, not to continue to find dirt on the President.          “This election is over. I realize 2016 did not turn out the way Speaker Pelosi wanted it to happen. But she cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide when an impeachment inquiry,” McCarthy said to reporters. What she said today made no difference of what’s been going on.” (RELATED: Nancy Pelosi Comes Out In Favor Of Impeachment)          Pelosi then publicly announced late Tuesday afternoon, “Today I’m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.” (RELATED: McCarthy Meets With US Trade Rep Robert Lighthizer About USMCA)          Despite Pelosi’s early reluctance to push for impeachment, there are currently 174 Democrats who support impeachment or an impeachment inquiry, compared to the 61 Democrats who do not yet support impeachment or impeachment inquiry. Pelosi has said she believes Trump is “goading” Democrats to impeach him because he thinks it will help him fire up his base.          Many of Pelosi’s Democratic colleagues have continued to push for impeaching Trump, such as Democratic Texas Rep. Al Green, who broke with Pelosi when he vowed to force a vote to impeach Trump in late March. Green, who previously had several bills to impeach Trump overwhelmingly rejected by the House of Representatives, called for a third impeachment vote. Pelosi said impeachment was “just not worth it” in a March interview.\n",

of Representatives will move forward with a vote on impeaching President Trump.          On Thursday morning, Pelosi said that the House will draft up articles of impeachment as a result of President Trump's \"failure to faithfully execute the law.\" She added that they have gathered evidence from weeks of testimony in front of the House Intelligence Committee.          \"[Pelosi and] the Democrats should be ashamed. [Trump] has done nothing but lead our country - resulting in a booming economy, more jobs [and] a stronger military, to name just a few of his major accomplishments. We look forward to a fair trial in the Senate,\" Grisham tweeted.          Pelosi did not describe the impeachment articles or the timeline during her press conference, but Democrats have outlined a case that will likely focus on alleged abuses of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats are hoping to finish impeachment “expeditiously,” and are hoping to vote on the articles before the House adjourns for the year on December 20.          Democrats allege that Trump tried to bribe Ukraine government officials into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden by temporarily withholding $391 million in security aid until the investigation was agreed upon. The president has repeatedly denied the accusations and defended his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, which led to a whistleblower coming forward.          Trump weighed in preemptively on Twitter saying, \"The Do Nothing Democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the House. They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them, they have gone crazy. Therefore I say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair....\" He added in a subsequent tweet, \".....trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business. We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is. I was elected to “Clean the Swamp,” and that’s what I am doing!\"\n",

withhold from the Senate articles of impeachment against President Trump has backfired. “Nancy Pelosi has a gun to her own head and is threatening to shoot, and Republicans should say, 'Make my day,'” Thiessen told “America’s Newsroom.”          TRUMP CALLS DEMS 'LIARS!' FOR DEEMING HIM SECURITY THREAT – AND THEN PAUSING IMPEACHMENT          Thiessen asserted that Pelosi does not have leverage with Republicans and noted popular support for impeachment has declined. If there was any Christmas truce between President Trump and Pelosi, it didn't last long. The president went so far Thursday morning as to suggest Pelosi should face a primary challenge, as he called her San Francisco district \"filthy\" and \"dirty\" and said she should focus on cleaning it up. Earlier Monday morning, the president tore into House Democrats over their handling of the impeachment process, calling them \"hypocrites\" and \"liars\" for allegedly seeking concessions in the Senate that Republicans were not afforded in the House -- and for hitting pause on impeachment after stressing the national security urgency of it all. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WHY IS PELOSI HOLDING THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT? DC INSIDERS HAVE SOME THEORIES          Despite this assessment, the impeachment process has stalled after Pelosi abruptly opted not to deliver articles of impeachment to the Senate, after the House adopted two articles alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for Trump's actions in Ukraine. Thiessen asserted that the House Democrats’ impeachment push backfired because popular support for removal of Trump declined. Thiessen went on to say, “That argument gets weaker every week that goes by that the articles haven’t impeached because, if you want unfairness, how about accusing the president of high crimes and misdemeanors and denying him a trial to defend himself.”\n",

Pelosi, D-Calif., for initiating an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, claiming she is going about the process in a rogue manner. Pelosi wrongfully quoted Ben Franklin, a signatory of the Constitution from Pennsylvania and otherwise accomplished little of substance through her remarks, Levin claimed Tuesday on \"The Mark Levin Show on Westwood One.\" \"She wouldn't take a vote on the House floor and she's in charge of scheduling... because she's still trying to protect 30, 40, 50 of her members,\" he said. \"One person from San Francisco -- one House district -- she has determined to launch a formal impeachment inquiry -- that's not what the Constitution calls for... Then, she cites the Constitution and Benjamin Franklin -- the same party that attacks the Constitution day in and day out, that attacks the... ratifiers of the Constitution day in and day out.\" He said that instead of bringing articles of impeachment to the House floor for a vote, she enlisted six committee chairs: Reps. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., Richard Neal, D-Mass., Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Maxine Waters, D-Calif., Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., to gather evidence and president it to herself and Nadler, who would make the ultimate determination on whether to hold an impeachment vote. \"She said... during the course of her mini-press-event that she is directing the six chairmen of these six committees to work together and provide their information to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler,\" he said. The \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" host called the impeachment inquiry a \"pseudo-event in the un-reality that they created to humiliate the president.\" He added he believed the situation is little more than a campaign effort by Democrats hoping to undermine Trump's 2020 chances. \"It must be taken very seriously and it must be fought every step of the way,\" he said, adding the American people -- in the form of the full House -- should decide the future of the presidency and not a, \"rogue, radical Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.\""

       "      <td>White House wants Senate trial rules to include ability to dismiss Trump charges</td>\n",
       "      <td>Republicans are debating including in the Senate resolution, which would govern the rules of the trial, a provision to dismiss the charges, something that would require 51 votes and would stop the trial in its tracks.          But moving ahead with a dismissal vote could put Republicans up for reelection in a tough spot if they are seen as moving too quickly to dismiss the case. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could not afford to lose more than two votes -- and GOP sources say the Kentucky Republican currently does not have enough votes to simply dismiss the case.          McConnell has made clear to his colleagues that he wants Trump to emerge victorious in the trial and is not willing to hold a vote that could fail, sources said. He's also keenly aware of what a vote to dismiss would look like politically, according to Republican senators, and has shepherded his conference away from the idea for several weeks.          Once the trial has begun, the Senate can vote on the merits of the articles of impeachment and choose to acquit Trump, something that can be done with only 34 votes because the Constitution requires 67 votes to convict the President and remove him from office. GOP proponents of this move argue Trump would have a stronger argument to say he was exonerated on the merits of the case, rather than simply relying on a procedural vote to dismiss the charges. Trump, though, might have to wait longer for a vote on acquittal to occur.          Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of McConnell's leadership team, said Monday he would prefer a vote to acquit the President on the merits, rather than seek a quick vote to dismiss the charges. \"That would be my advice. Let both sides have their say and have their vote.\" And Cornyn downplayed a weekend tweet from Trump calling for an \"outright dismissal.\" \"At different times, the President has expressed different views,\" Cornyn said. \"I wouldn't get too distracted by an intervening tweet.\" While Republicans are short of the votes to dismiss the charges, the issue remains a point of discussion due to McConnell's insistence that the initial rules of the trial hew closely to those used in President Bill Clinton's trial in 1999 . That resolution included a motion to dismiss, which failed. Republican senators this time around have been debating whether to remove it entirely, or push it further back in the proceedings than where it was structured then, senators familiar with the discussions said. The White House wants to keep the motion to dismiss in play because \"there's no reason to take options off the table at the beginning of the whole process,\" said one source familiar with the discussions. McConnell has counseled Republicans privately that they can decide how to proceed after both the House Democratic impeachment managers and President's defense team make their cases, followed by questions from senators. At that point, GOP senators must decide whether to allow witnesses, seek to acquit the President or move to dismiss the case. \"Yes, I am,\" Sen. Lamar Alexander, a retiring Tennessee Republican and McConnell confidante, said Monday when asked if he's open to witnesses. \"What I think is important is we have a vote on whether we need additional documents and witnesses. And that would only be appropriate after we've heard the case and asked our questions.\" That tracks directly with the model McConnell has touted now for weeks: a Senate resolution governing the trial that follow the procedures of Clinton's trial. In that Clinton resolution, the Senate included a motion to dismiss the charges after opening arguments were delivered and after senators asked their questions. About two weeks into the Clinton trial, Democrats forced a vote to dismiss the charges. But that dismissal measure failed, 44-56, and the trial continued for another two-and-half weeks. McConnell hinted last week that the Senate resolution would include a provision allowing the charges to be dismissed, but senators said the talks about how to handle the motion to dismiss still hadn't been finalized. \"We're going to have a similar resolution,\" McConnell told reporters. \"It may not be word for word, exactly the same, but a similar resolution. And we'll be glad to show it to you when -- when we unveil it.\" McConnell fueled Democratic concerns about dismissing the charges outright when he signed onto a resolution sponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, that would allow a senator to offer a motion to dismiss if the House did not transmit the articles of impeachment within 25 days. The viability of Hawley's resolution was viewed as limited to impossible -- it would require a Senate rule change, which would take 67 votes to occur. Republicans only control 53 seats in the chamber. McConnell could move to drop the vote threshold to 51, but it would require him to \"go nuclear,\" or move to eliminate the legislative filibuster, something he has long opposed. A source familiar with McConnell's decision to support the resolution said he backed \"the spirit\" of Hawley's idea given the frustration over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to hold onto the articles for more than three weeks, but wasn't planning to push forward on it given its prospects. Pelosi's about to hit send on the impeachment articles But McConnell's decision to sign onto the idea drew sharp criticism from Pelosi, who demanded to see the Senate resolution and understand how the dismissal provision would be structured before sending over the articles of impeachment that would initiate the trial. She ultimately relented and indicated that the articles would be sent over this week. ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Dismissing is a coverup ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Over the weekend, Trump argued that having a trial would add credibility to the Democrats' case, calling for a dismissal of the charges. \"Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, 'no pressure' Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have,\" Trump tweeted. \"I agree!\" This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Capitol Hill reporters protest expected restrictions on media access during Senate impeachment trial</td>\n",
       "      <td>The letter — addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) — said Capitol security officials are considering measures that are all but certain to make it harder for journalists to report on the trial and question senators about their actions.          A magnetometer in the Senate press gallery will require reporters to trickle into the chamber one at a time. Electronic devices will be banned, leaving reporters to scuttle in and out of the room to send tweets and emails. Reporters will be placed in pens, roping them off and restricting their ability to speak freely with senators as they enter and exit.          “Currently,” Wire tweeted, “we can walk with Senators as they enter the chamber, wait for them outside of meetings or lunches. It leads to a diversity of voices. Penning us means people across the country might not hear from their senator.”          Officials have also proposed limiting video coverage of the arrival of the articles of impeachment to a single pool camera with no audio, she said.          “These potential restrictions fail to acknowledge what currently works on Capitol Hill, or the way the American public expects to be able to follow a vital news event about their government in the digital age,” the committee’s letter read.          Details about the nature and scope of the restrictions under consideration remained unclear, as neither the Senate sergeant at arms nor the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, which are responsible for them, has issued a formal document.          “You’ll have to decide where’s the best place to watch; it’s like watching a football game,” Blunt said. “Where’s the best place to watch it?”          Blunt told the Star that while most of the trial will be broadcast, other segments will be closed, in line with procedures during the trial of President Bill Clinton in early 1999. “I mean closed session,” he said. “I mean there will be nobody there but senators and essential staff. No cameras, no C-SPAN, no coverage.”          He said that “part of the decision about access” for reporters to senators “will be driven by how quickly you can clear the room” for the closed sessions, “so you can have that debate and get people back into the room so you can move forward.”          Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, called the restrictions “a big mistake” in comments to reporters after Tuesday night’s Democratic candidate debate in Des Moines, where she is campaigning for the party’s presidential nomination.          The correspondents’ committee said members raised concerns with the sergeant at arms and the Rules Committee. “But decisions are being made quickly as plans for the trial are completed,” the letter read, “and we are hearing that nearly every suggestion has been rejected without an explanation of how the restrictions contribute to safety rather than simply limit coverage of the trial.”          News of the restrictions prompted alarm online from reporters, with some protesting the move as one that will effectively shield senators from scrutiny during the trial.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Some House Democrats push Pelosi to withhold impeachment articles, delay Senate trial</td>\n",
       "      <td>The gambit has gained some traction inside the left wing of the House Democratic Caucus this week. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said Wednesday, as his colleagues debated the impeachment articles on the House floor, that he has spoken to three dozen Democratic lawmakers who had expressed some level of enthusiasm for the idea of “rounding out the record and spending the time to do this right.”          Another Democrat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said there is “serious concern about whether there will be a fair trial on the Senate side” and acknowledged active talks about withholding the articles.          The notion has been most prominently advocated by Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor who has advised the House Judiciary Committee on the impeachment process. In a recent medianame op-ed, he wrote that “the public has a right to observe a meaningful trial rather than simply learn that the result is a verdict of not guilty.”          Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has asked McConnell to call several Trump administration witnesses, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. McConnell has dismissed those requests and signaled that he expects to hold a relatively short trial that will end with a summary dismissal of the impeachment charges.          Republicans have scoffed at the notion of the House withholding the articles, noting it hardly counts as leverage to deny the GOP the ability to remove a president that the party wants to keep in place. Some aides further argued that withholding the articles would only fuel Republican arguments that Democrats are engaged in a partisan abuse of the Constitution.          But Democratic leaders may be forced to deal with the issue in the coming days. Blumenauer said he had already raised it with Pelosi (Calif.), House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (Md.) and other top party leaders.          Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Hoyer did not rule out the idea: “It’s an interesting proposal. I don’t think that that’s the path we will follow, but that does not mean we will immediately deliver it. There are considerations related to other legislation.”          A senior Democratic aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations said the impeachment articles will not be immediately transmitted to the Senate on Wednesday. Rather, they will be held until Pelosi names impeachment managers, the House members who will present the case for Trump’s removal in the Senate.          “There will be a debate and vote on that resolution” naming the managers, the aide said. If a significant number of Democrats refuse to vote for that resolution, they could force the issue.          The timing of that vote is unclear; the House is expected to recess for the winter holidays as soon as Thursday and not return until Jan. 7.          Blumenauer said that if McConnell does not agree to call the Democratic witnesses and stage a fair trial, Democrats could simply hold on to the articles indefinitely and continue to investigate Trump. The House is involved in multiple court cases seeking documents and testimony that have yet to be resolved.          “Who knows what would happen to augment the record? This ought to be able to play out,” he said. “There’s no advantage to rushing this.”          But the notion of prolonging the impeachment process indefinitely is almost certain to infuriate House members from competitive districts, who have pushed Pelosi for months to keep the investigation focused and limited to Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine.          Blumenauer declined to discuss whether members interested in the gambit would withhold their votes on naming managers to force the issue: “I’m not interested in sparking controversy in the caucus,” he said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\"The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.\" – George Orwell, \"1984\"          The Senate impeachment trial of President Trump ended not with a bang but a whimper. What different outcome could one expect from a trial without so much as a single witness, a single document, any cross-examination or a defendant respectful enough to show up? Law students are taught early on that a trial is not a grudge match or an ordeal; it is a search for the truth. Trial lawyers know that cross-examination is the most effective truth-testing tool available to them. But the search for the truth requires witnesses, and when the command from Senate Republican leaders came down that there shall be no witnesses, the truth-telling mission of Trump's trial was radically transformed into a steamroller of political power. GREGG JARRETT: TRUMP ACQUITTAL IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS A HUMILIATING DEFEAT FOR PARTISAN DEMOCRATS          And in its wake is a Congress ceding power to the presidency, almost as if the states had ratified a constitutional amendment redefining the impeachment language to permit a president to engage in high crimes and misdemeanors so long as he believes that they are in the national interest and so long as his party has an iron-clad grip on the Senate. How could presidential crimes be in the national interest? Here is the backstory. When the House of Representatives voted in favor of two articles of impeachment against Trump, it characterized his lawlessness as contempt of Congress and an abuse of power. The contempt of Congress consisted of Trump's orders to subordinates to disregard congressional subpoenas. Both Republican- and Democratic-controlled Houses of Representatives have deemed such presidential instructions in an impeachment inquiry as impeachable per se. The abuse allegations address Trump's solicitation of assistance for his reelection campaign from a foreign government by holding up the release of $391 million in military aid to the same foreign government. These funds were congressionally appropriated and ordered to be paid by legislation that Trump had signed into law. Federal law prohibits such solicitation as criminal and prohibits government officials from seeking personal favors in return for performing their governmental duties. The latter is bribery. Because the solicitation that Trump committed was a crime against the government, it is among those referred to when the Constitution was written as a \"high\" crime. High crimes are a constitutional basis for impeachment, along with bribery and treason. The evidence that Trump did this is overwhelming and beyond a reasonable doubt, and no one with firsthand knowledge denied it. Numerous government officials recounted that the presidential leverage of $391 million in U.S. assistance for a personal political favor did occur and the government's own watchdog concluded that it was indisputably unlawful. The favor Trump sought was an announcement by the Ukrainian government of the commencement of an investigation of Trump's potential presidential foe, former Vice President Joe Biden. While the Senate was hearing House prosecution managers argue their case, and Trump's lawyers challenged those arguments, The New York Times revealed that John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, had authored an as yet unpublished book demonstrating that the House case against Trump was true. True because, unlike the senators who shut their eyes and ears at Trump's trial, Bolton saw for himself the presidential tit-for-tat machinations that the House had alleged and, if proven, were criminal and impeachable. The Times also revealed the existence of 24 emails sent by Trump aides manifesting indisputably his lawless behavior. But the emails are secret. At the same time, two signal events occurred in the impeachment trial. The first was an argument by Trump's lawyers that every president seeking reelection believes his victory will be in the national interest and thus all presidential efforts toward that victory are constitutional and lawful. This morally bankrupt, intellectually dishonest argument – which effectively resuscitates from history's graveyard President Richard Nixon’s logic that \"when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal\" because the president is above the law – must have resonated with Senate Republican leaders. The leaders coerced their Senate Republican colleagues into embracing the view that – since the president did not want Bolton to testify or White House emails to be revealed – they must bar all witnesses and documents. The second signal event was shameful. It was the 51 to 49 Senate vote to bar witnesses and documents from the trial. Do innocent people behave this way? If Trump really believes he did not commit any crimes and any impeachable offenses, why would he orchestrate blocking evidence? And who – having taken an oath to do \"impartial justice\" – would close their eyes to the truth? How could such a marathon of speeches possibly be considered a trial? Trump will luxuriate in his victory. But the personal victory for him is a legal assault on the Constitution. The president has taken an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. Instead, he has trashed it. By manipulating Senate Republicans to bar firsthand evidence and keep it from senatorial and public scrutiny, Trump and his Senate collaborators have insulated him and future presidents from the moral and constitutional truism that no president is above the law.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Now to the new impeachment standoff in Washington Democrats and Republicans are clashing over a timeline for the trial in the senate. President trop is looking for the GOP senate for vindication but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It's throwing a wrench in the plans medianame the nest Iraq or Tara has the latest from Washington and that's good morning. Good mornings and in Canada Democrats are hoping to have witnesses testify as part of president trying to send trial that Republicans have already rejected that request to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hoping. Threatening to possibly delay president trumps trial. Could give her leverage. History put on hold president from becoming just the third president in US history to be impeached. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now refusing to take the next steps. Saying she wolf said articles of impeachment over to the set net. Until majority leader Mitch McConnell reveals with the president's trial will look like. Act founders owning both the constitution. They suspected that there could be a blow president. I don't think they suspected that with have a role president and rogue leader in the senate at the same time. Democrats have been pushing to hear from four witnesses the White House had blocked from testifying. Including acting chief of staff make Maldini and former national security advisor John Bolton. The issue coming up at last night's democratic debate. It president trop. Thinks that he should not be impeached he should not scared to what or where his own witnesses. But McConnell has already rejected that request. Indicating he wants a speedy trial and that he's working in total coordination with the White House Democrats are hoping threatening to possibly delay trumps trial will give them leverage. But for now at least Republicans aren't waiting. Looks like prosecutors are getting cold fate. In front of the entire country. And second guessing whether that you don't want the go to trial. President chopper responding on Twitter writing Pelosi is afraid to present impeachment to the senate. And adding so after Democrats gave me no due process in the house no lawyers no witnesses no nothing. They now want to tell the senate how to run their trial we think that what they did is unconstitutional. And lawmakers are hoping to have that senate trial begin the week of January 6 but that will all depend on when house speaker Pelosi decides to send those articles of impeachment. Over to the senate to name Kenneth.</td>\n",

       "61                         White House wants Senate trial rules to include ability to dismiss Trump charges  Republicans are debating including in the Senate resolution, which would govern the rules of the trial, a provision to dismiss the charges, something that would require 51 votes and would stop the trial in its tracks.          But moving ahead with a dismissal vote could put Republicans up for reelection in a tough spot if they are seen as moving too quickly to dismiss the case. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could not afford to lose more than two votes -- and GOP sources say the Kentucky Republican currently does not have enough votes to simply dismiss the case.          McConnell has made clear to his colleagues that he wants Trump to emerge victorious in the trial and is not willing to hold a vote that could fail, sources said. He's also keenly aware of what a vote to dismiss would look like politically, according to Republican senators, and has shepherded his conference away from the idea for several weeks.          Once the trial has begun, the Senate can vote on the merits of the articles of impeachment and choose to acquit Trump, something that can be done with only 34 votes because the Constitution requires 67 votes to convict the President and remove him from office. GOP proponents of this move argue Trump would have a stronger argument to say he was exonerated on the merits of the case, rather than simply relying on a procedural vote to dismiss the charges. Trump, though, might have to wait longer for a vote on acquittal to occur.          Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of McConnell's leadership team, said Monday he would prefer a vote to acquit the President on the merits, rather than seek a quick vote to dismiss the charges. \"That would be my advice. Let both sides have their say and have their vote.\" And Cornyn downplayed a weekend tweet from Trump calling for an \"outright dismissal.\" \"At different times, the President has expressed different views,\" Cornyn said. \"I wouldn't get too distracted by an intervening tweet.\" While Republicans are short of the votes to dismiss the charges, the issue remains a point of discussion due to McConnell's insistence that the initial rules of the trial hew closely to those used in President Bill Clinton's trial in 1999 . That resolution included a motion to dismiss, which failed. Republican senators this time around have been debating whether to remove it entirely, or push it further back in the proceedings than where it was structured then, senators familiar with the discussions said. The White House wants to keep the motion to dismiss in play because \"there's no reason to take options off the table at the beginning of the whole process,\" said one source familiar with the discussions. McConnell has counseled Republicans privately that they can decide how to proceed after both the House Democratic impeachment managers and President's defense team make their cases, followed by questions from senators. At that point, GOP senators must decide whether to allow witnesses, seek to acquit the President or move to dismiss the case. \"Yes, I am,\" Sen. Lamar Alexander, a retiring Tennessee Republican and McConnell confidante, said Monday when asked if he's open to witnesses. \"What I think is important is we have a vote on whether we need additional documents and witnesses. And that would only be appropriate after we've heard the case and asked our questions.\" That tracks directly with the model McConnell has touted now for weeks: a Senate resolution governing the trial that follow the procedures of Clinton's trial. In that Clinton resolution, the Senate included a motion to dismiss the charges after opening arguments were delivered and after senators asked their questions. About two weeks into the Clinton trial, Democrats forced a vote to dismiss the charges. But that dismissal measure failed, 44-56, and the trial continued for another two-and-half weeks. McConnell hinted last week that the Senate resolution would include a provision allowing the charges to be dismissed, but senators said the talks about how to handle the motion to dismiss still hadn't been finalized. \"We're going to have a similar resolution,\" McConnell told reporters. \"It may not be word for word, exactly the same, but a similar resolution. And we'll be glad to show it to you when -- when we unveil it.\" McConnell fueled Democratic concerns about dismissing the charges outright when he signed onto a resolution sponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, that would allow a senator to offer a motion to dismiss if the House did not transmit the articles of impeachment within 25 days. The viability of Hawley's resolution was viewed as limited to impossible -- it would require a Senate rule change, which would take 67 votes to occur. Republicans only control 53 seats in the chamber. McConnell could move to drop the vote threshold to 51, but it would require him to \"go nuclear,\" or move to eliminate the legislative filibuster, something he has long opposed. A source familiar with McConnell's decision to support the resolution said he backed \"the spirit\" of Hawley's idea given the frustration over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to hold onto the articles for more than three weeks, but wasn't planning to push forward on it given its prospects. Pelosi's about to hit send on the impeachment articles But McConnell's decision to sign onto the idea drew sharp criticism from Pelosi, who demanded to see the Senate resolution and understand how the dismissal provision would be structured before sending over the articles of impeachment that would initiate the trial. She ultimately relented and indicated that the articles would be sent over this week. ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Dismissing is a coverup ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Over the weekend, Trump argued that having a trial would add credibility to the Democrats' case, calling for a dismissal of the charges. \"Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, 'no pressure' Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have,\" Trump tweeted. \"I agree!\" This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.\n",

Schumer (D-N.Y.) — said Capitol security officials are considering measures that are all but certain to make it harder for journalists to report on the trial and question senators about their actions.          A magnetometer in the Senate press gallery will require reporters to trickle into the chamber one at a time. Electronic devices will be banned, leaving reporters to scuttle in and out of the room to send tweets and emails. Reporters will be placed in pens, roping them off and restricting their ability to speak freely with senators as they enter and exit.          “Currently,” Wire tweeted, “we can walk with Senators as they enter the chamber, wait for them outside of meetings or lunches. It leads to a diversity of voices. Penning us means people across the country might not hear from their senator.”          Officials have also proposed limiting video coverage of the arrival of the articles of impeachment to a single pool camera with no audio, she said.          “These potential restrictions fail to acknowledge what currently works on Capitol Hill, or the way the American public expects to be able to follow a vital news event about their government in the digital age,” the committee’s letter read.          Details about the nature and scope of the restrictions under consideration remained unclear, as neither the Senate sergeant at arms nor the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, which are responsible for them, has issued a formal document.          “You’ll have to decide where’s the best place to watch; it’s like watching a football game,” Blunt said. “Where’s the best place to watch it?”          Blunt told the Star that while most of the trial will be broadcast, other segments will be closed, in line with procedures during the trial of President Bill Clinton in early 1999. “I mean closed session,” he said. “I mean there will be nobody there but senators and essential staff. No cameras, no C-SPAN, no coverage.”          He said that “part of the decision about access” for reporters to senators “will be driven by how quickly you can clear the room” for the closed sessions, “so you can have that debate and get people back into the room so you can move forward.”          Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, called the restrictions “a big mistake” in comments to reporters after Tuesday night’s Democratic candidate debate in Des Moines, where she is campaigning for the party’s presidential nomination.          The correspondents’ committee said members raised concerns with the sergeant at arms and the Rules Committee. “But decisions are being made quickly as plans for the trial are completed,” the letter read, “and we are hearing that nearly every suggestion has been rejected without an explanation of how the restrictions contribute to safety rather than simply limit coverage of the trial.”          News of the restrictions prompted alarm online from reporters, with some protesting the move as one that will effectively shield senators from scrutiny during the trial.\n",

Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said Wednesday, as his colleagues debated the impeachment articles on the House floor, that he has spoken to three dozen Democratic lawmakers who had expressed some level of enthusiasm for the idea of “rounding out the record and spending the time to do this right.”          Another Democrat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said there is “serious concern about whether there will be a fair trial on the Senate side” and acknowledged active talks about withholding the articles.          The notion has been most prominently advocated by Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor who has advised the House Judiciary Committee on the impeachment process. In a recent medianame op-ed, he wrote that “the public has a right to observe a meaningful trial rather than simply learn that the result is a verdict of not guilty.”          Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has asked McConnell to call several Trump administration witnesses, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. McConnell has dismissed those requests and signaled that he expects to hold a relatively short trial that will end with a summary dismissal of the impeachment charges.          Republicans have scoffed at the notion of the House withholding the articles, noting it hardly counts as leverage to deny the GOP the ability to remove a president that the party wants to keep in place. Some aides further argued that withholding the articles would only fuel Republican arguments that Democrats are engaged in a partisan abuse of the Constitution.          But Democratic leaders may be forced to deal with the issue in the coming days. Blumenauer said he had already raised it with Pelosi (Calif.), House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (Md.) and other top party leaders.          Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Hoyer did not rule out the idea: “It’s an interesting proposal. I don’t think that that’s the path we will follow, but that does not mean we will immediately deliver it. There are considerations related to other legislation.”          A senior Democratic aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations said the impeachment articles will not be immediately transmitted to the Senate on Wednesday. Rather, they will be held until Pelosi names impeachment managers, the House members who will present the case for Trump’s removal in the Senate.          “There will be a debate and vote on that resolution” naming the managers, the aide said. If a significant number of Democrats refuse to vote for that resolution, they could force the issue.          The timing of that vote is unclear; the House is expected to recess for the winter holidays as soon as Thursday and not return until Jan. 7.          Blumenauer said that if McConnell does not agree to call the Democratic witnesses and stage a fair trial, Democrats could simply hold on to the articles indefinitely and continue to investigate Trump. The House is involved in multiple court cases seeking documents and testimony that have yet to be resolved.          “Who knows what would happen to augment the record? This ought to be able to play out,” he said. “There’s no advantage to rushing this.”          But the notion of prolonging the impeachment process indefinitely is almost certain to infuriate House members from competitive districts, who have pushed Pelosi for months to keep the investigation focused and limited to Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine.          Blumenauer declined to discuss whether members interested in the gambit would withhold their votes on naming managers to force the issue: “I’m not interested in sparking controversy in the caucus,” he said.\n",
       "402  Judge Andrew Napolitano: Despite his impeachment trial acquittal, Trump clearly guilty of a high crime                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \"The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.\" – George Orwell, \"1984\"          The Senate impeachment trial of President Trump ended not with a bang but a whimper. What different outcome could one expect from a trial without so much as a single witness, a single document, any cross-examination or a defendant respectful enough to show up? Law students are taught early on that a trial is not a grudge match or an ordeal; it is a search for the truth. Trial lawyers know that cross-examination is the most effective truth-testing tool available to them. But the search for the truth requires witnesses, and when the command from Senate Republican leaders came down that there shall be no witnesses, the truth-telling mission of Trump's trial was radically transformed into a steamroller of political power. GREGG JARRETT: TRUMP ACQUITTAL IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS A HUMILIATING DEFEAT FOR PARTISAN DEMOCRATS          And in its wake is a Congress ceding power to the presidency, almost as if the states had ratified a constitutional amendment redefining the impeachment language to permit a president to engage in high crimes and misdemeanors so long as he believes that they are in the national interest and so long as his party has an iron-clad grip on the Senate. How could presidential crimes be in the national interest? Here is the backstory. When the House of Representatives voted in favor of two articles of impeachment against Trump, it characterized his lawlessness as contempt of Congress and an abuse of power. The contempt of Congress consisted of Trump's orders to subordinates to disregard congressional subpoenas. Both Republican- and Democratic-controlled Houses of Representatives have deemed such presidential instructions in an impeachment inquiry as impeachable per se. The abuse allegations address Trump's solicitation of assistance for his reelection campaign from a foreign government by holding up the release of $391 million in military aid to the same foreign government. These funds were congressionally appropriated and ordered to be paid by legislation that Trump had signed into law. Federal law prohibits such solicitation as criminal and prohibits government officials from seeking personal favors in return for performing their governmental duties. The latter is bribery. Because the solicitation that Trump committed was a crime against the government, it is among those referred to when the Constitution was written as a \"high\" crime. High crimes are a constitutional basis for impeachment, along with bribery and treason. The evidence that Trump did this is overwhelming and beyond a reasonable doubt, and no one with firsthand knowledge denied it. Numerous government officials recounted that the presidential leverage of $391 million in U.S. assistance for a personal political favor did occur and the government's own watchdog concluded that it was indisputably unlawful. The favor Trump sought was an announcement by the Ukrainian government of the commencement of an investigation of Trump's potential presidential foe, former Vice President Joe Biden. While the Senate was hearing House prosecution managers argue their case, and Trump's lawyers challenged those arguments, The New York Times revealed that John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, had authored an as yet unpublished book demonstrating that the House case against Trump was true. True because, unlike the senators who shut their eyes and ears at Trump's trial, Bolton saw for himself the presidential tit-for-tat machinations that the House had alleged and, if proven, were criminal and impeachable. The Times also revealed the existence of 24 emails sent by Trump aides manifesting indisputably his lawless behavior. But the emails are secret. At the same time, two signal events occurred in the impeachment trial. The first was an argument by Trump's lawyers that every president seeking reelection believes his victory will be in the national interest and thus all presidential efforts toward that victory are constitutional and lawful. This morally bankrupt, intellectually dishonest argument – which effectively resuscitates from history's graveyard President Richard Nixon’s logic that \"when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal\" because the president is above the law – must have resonated with Senate Republican leaders. The leaders coerced their Senate Republican colleagues into embracing the view that – since the president did not want Bolton to testify or White House emails to be revealed – they must bar all witnesses and documents. The second signal event was shameful. It was the 51 to 49 Senate vote to bar witnesses and documents from the trial. Do innocent people behave this way? If Trump really believes he did not commit any crimes and any impeachable offenses, why would he orchestrate blocking evidence? And who – having taken an oath to do \"impartial justice\" – would close their eyes to the truth? How could such a marathon of speeches possibly be considered a trial? Trump will luxuriate in his victory. But the personal victory for him is a legal assault on the Constitution. The president has taken an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. Instead, he has trashed it. By manipulating Senate Republicans to bar firsthand evidence and keep it from senatorial and public scrutiny, Trump and his Senate collaborators have insulated him and future presidents from the moral and constitutional truism that no president is above the law.\n",

President trop is looking for the GOP senate for vindication but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It's throwing a wrench in the plans medianame the nest Iraq or Tara has the latest from Washington and that's good morning. Good mornings and in Canada Democrats are hoping to have witnesses testify as part of president trying to send trial that Republicans have already rejected that request to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hoping. Threatening to possibly delay president trumps trial. Could give her leverage. History put on hold president from becoming just the third president in US history to be impeached. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now refusing to take the next steps. Saying she wolf said articles of impeachment over to the set net. Until majority leader Mitch McConnell reveals with the president's trial will look like. Act founders owning both the constitution. They suspected that there could be a blow president. I don't think they suspected that with have a role president and rogue leader in the senate at the same time. Democrats have been pushing to hear from four witnesses the White House had blocked from testifying. Including acting chief of staff make Maldini and former national security advisor John Bolton. The issue coming up at last night's democratic debate. It president trop. Thinks that he should not be impeached he should not scared to what or where his own witnesses. But McConnell has already rejected that request. Indicating he wants a speedy trial and that he's working in total coordination with the White House Democrats are hoping threatening to possibly delay trumps trial will give them leverage. But for now at least Republicans aren't waiting. Looks like prosecutors are getting cold fate. In front of the entire country. And second guessing whether that you don't want the go to trial. President chopper responding on Twitter writing Pelosi is afraid to present impeachment to the senate. And adding so after Democrats gave me no due process in the house no lawyers no witnesses no nothing. They now want to tell the senate how to run their trial we think that what they did is unconstitutional. And lawmakers are hoping to have that senate trial begin the week of January 6 but that will all depend on when house speaker Pelosi decides to send those articles of impeachment. Over to the senate to name Kenneth."

       "      <td>Senate rejects new witnesses in Trump impeachment trial, paving the way for acquittal</td>\n",
       "      <td>— The Senate rejected a motion to allow consideration of additional witnesses and documents in President Trump's impeachment trial, rebuffing Democrats and virtually ensuring the president's ultimate acquittal on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate will hold the final vote Wednesday on the two articles of impeachment.          The motion failed by a vote of 49 to 51. Democrats failed to convince four Republicans to join them in voting to allow new evidence, with just two GOP lawmakers — Senators Susan Collins and Mitt Romney — crossing the aisle.          The Senate adjourned Friday around 8 p.m. and will reconvene Monday at 11 a.m. The Senate approved Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's timeline for the rest of the trial: Closing arguments will be Monday, senators will give speeches Monday through Wednesday and the final vote will occur Wednesday.          Earlier in the day, Republicans and the president's legal team argued the introduction of new witnesses and documents would prolong the trial for weeks or months.          They also warned the move would set a precedent of the Senate conducting its own impeachment investigation, arguing the House should have exhausted its options to compel testimony before impeaching the president. Some Republicans conceded the president acted improperly by pressuring Ukraine, but said removing him from office would lead to more frequent and more partisan impeachment proceedings.          \"If this shallow, hurried and wholly partisan impeachment were to succeed, it would rip the country apart, pouring gasoline on the fire of cultural divisions that already exist,\" Senator Lamar Alexander, one of the Republicans who was on the fence, said in a statement Thursday. \"It would create the weapon of perpetual impeachment to be used against future presidents whenever the House of Representatives is of a different political party.\"          The House managers, however, warned that failing to pursue new testimony from officials like former national security adviser John Bolton would set a \"very dangerous and long-lasting precedent\" that would \"nullify\" Congress' impeachment power.          \"This will set a new precedent. This will be cited in impeachment trials from this point until the end of history,\" Schiff said. \"You can bet that in every impeachment that follows, whether it's a presidential impeachment or the impeachment of a judge, if that judge or president believes that it is to his or her advantage that there will be a trial with no witnesses, they will cite the case of Donald J. Trump.\"          New revelations by former national security adviser John Bolton hung over Friday's vote and served to punctuate Democrats' arguments. The Senate reconvened just after The New York Times reported new details from a manuscript of Bolton's upcoming book.          Bolton writes, according to The Times, that the president instructed him to call the president of Ukraine and tell him to meet with Rudy Giuliani in May 2019. Bolton's reported account is the earliest indication of the president's direct involvement in the campaign to get Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Bolton has said he would appear before the Senate if he was subpoenaed.          for complete coverage of the president's impeachment trial in the Senate.

       "      <td>Joe Biden Nixes Deal That Would Have Him Testify In Senate Impeachment Trial</td>\n",
       "      <td>Former Vice President Joe Biden has dashed Senate Democrats’ hopes that he might submit to a witness trade, testifying in front of President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial in return for testimony from former White House national security advisor, John Bolton.          Biden was asked about the deal during a campaign stop in Iowa, and while he admitted that the issue wasn’t “irrational” he claimed Trump’s trial centered around a “Constitutional issue,” rather than one involving his and his son’s work in Ukraine. Testifying in front of the Senate, Biden added, would turn the trial into “some kind of farce or political theater,” as if it wasn’t already headed in that direction.          Ultimately, Biden says, he wants “no part” of any deal that would require he testify so that a White House official would also take the stand.          Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz floated the idea initially but, according to reports that surfaced yesterday, a group of Senate Democrats were seriously considering a testimony trade just so that Senate Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, would cave to the idea of hosting some witness testimony during the Senate impeachment trial.          Democrats have been desperate to find some way to get witnesses on the Senate floor, ostensibly to help close holes left in the Democrats’ case against the president from the House impeachment inquiry. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) tried, valiantly, to force McConnell to welcome testimony by withholding the articles of impeachment from the Senate, but even moderate Republicans, who were the deciding factor, said they’d prefer the case be set out in full by the Senate impeachment managers.          On Tuesday, in a vote that came near midnight, the Senate voted against allowing witness testimony during the first part of Trump’s Senate trial, but several Senators — including those same moderate Republicans — reserved the right to reverse their vote if, after the two sides present their opening arguments, questions remained about the president’s behavior.          Tuesday night, Democrats met in secret to discuss the Biden for Bolton trade (though, at the time, it wasn’t clear whether they would have given up Joe Biden or his son Hunter, whose involvement in Ukrainian oil and gas company, Burisma, is at the center of what Democrats claim is a “quid-pro-quo” agreement between Trump and the Ukrainian government, foreign aid in return for an investigation into both Bidens’ roles in how Burisma was treated by Ukrainian prosecutors back during the Obama Administration.          Democrats in charge of the trial seemed reticent to ink the deal and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), one of the House’s seven “impeachment managers,” openly decried the issue, calling it “irrelevant.” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), a key “Resistance” figure in Congress added that Hunter Biden’s testimony would be “irrelevant,” and that only Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney would need to testify.          If the Senate does vote to allow witnesses, it will be up to Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, to determine which witnesses are “relevant” to the task at hand.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Now that they’ve passed an impeachment bill, Democrats are slow-walking the process in a bid to secure procedural guarantees from Senate Republicans on how the trial will unfold.          Now that the House of Representatives has voted to impeach President Trump, action shifts to the Senate, whose members are charged by the Constitution to determine whether he should be convicted or acquitted. Yet wary Democrats are slow-walking the process in a bid to secure procedural guarantees from Senate Republicans on how the trial will unfold.          The House must first appoint members who will manage its case during the trial. When that happens, the House can notify the Senate of its decision to impeach the president and appoint managers.          According to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House will refrain from appointing managers until Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., agree on the ground rules that will govern the trial. At issue are whether the Senate will call additional witnesses and how long the trial will last.          Schumer wants the Senate to call particular witnesses (namely those who refused to testify during the House’s impeachment inquiry). But McConnell doesn’t think witnesses are needed and wants the trial wrapped up quickly.          Notwithstanding the McConnell-Schumer impasse, the House’s decision to appoint managers and notify the Senate is a major development. It formally begins the impeachment process under the Senate’s existing rules and practices. The Senate’s “Rules of Procedure When Sitting On Impeachment Trials” (i.e., the Impeachment Rules) stipulate clearly that senators must consider articles of impeachment once they arrive from the House. In short, the Senate must hold a trial; senators must act.          According to Rule II of the Impeachment Rules, proceedings begin as soon as the House managers arrive at “the bar of the Senate” to exhibit their articles of impeachment against President Trump. After the presentation of the articles, the rules stipulate that the presiding officer informs the House managers that the Senate will notify the House when it has organized for trial. The House managers then leave the Senate.          After the withdrawal of the House managers, the impeachment rules require it to organize for the trial. The first order of business under Rule III is the need to administer oaths to senators and their presiding officer.          The Constitution (Article I, section 3, clause 6) requires the chief justice of the United States to preside in a presidential impeachment trial such as this one. In that case, Rule IV details the procedures that senators follow to administer the oaths. Specifically, the presiding officer first administers the oath mentioned above to the chief justice. The chief justice then administers the oath to senators, en bloc.          After the administration of oaths, the impeachment rules stipulate that the chief justice instructs the sergeant at arms to announce the beginning of the trial. Rule III requires the Senate to remain in session “from day to day…after the trial shall commence (unless otherwise ordered by the Senate) until final judgment shall be rendered” (Sundays excepted).          “Unless otherwise ordered by the Senate” underscores the fact that senators can adopt a different trial schedule by passing a resolution to that effect. Senators may also suspend the impeachment trial by unanimous consent to consider legislative and executive business.          Under Rule VIII, senators must issue a writ of summons setting the date on which the president must respond to the accusations against him. (The Senate also sets the date on which the House managers respond to the president’s response.) Rule XXV even prescribes the text of the summons.          Under the Senate’s regular rules (i.e., its “Standing Rules”), senators could filibuster the writ of summons. But under its impeachment rules, such dilatory tactics are prohibited to ensure that the trial is not delayed and that a verdict is reached. Rule XXIV stipulates that “all the orders and decisions may be acted upon without objection” during the trial. If senators object, “the orders and decisions shall be voted on without debate by yeas and nays….subject to the operation of Rule VII.”          Rule VII requires the presiding officer to “direct all the forms of proceedings while the Senate is sitting for the purpose of trying an impeachment.” In that capacity, senators expect the presiding officer to rule on questions of evidence (i.e., issues of relevancy, materiality, redundancy) and any “incidental questions” that may arise during the trial.          The presiding officer may rule when presented with such questions, or he may submit them directly to the Senate to be decided. If the presiding officer does rule on a question raised during the trial, any senator may appeal it and ask for a “formal vote.”          Regardless of how questions are decided, the impeachment rules prohibit debate. That means the Senate votes immediately whenever questions arise during a trial, and the side with more votes (i.e., a simple majority) wins.          While the Senate’s impeachment rules permit limited debate during closed sessions, senators are allowed only one speech each in such circumstances under the provisions of Rule XXIV. The rule also caps speeches on “interlocutory questions” at ten minutes.          The Senate may adopt supplementary rules to structure impeachment proceedings. During the 1999 Bill Clinton impeachment trial, senators approved two supplementary rules packages (S. Res. 16 and S. Res. 30). S. Res. 16 set the dates by which the president was required to respond to the articles of impeachment and by which the House managers were required to respond to the president’s response. It also set aside a 16-hour block of time for senators to question the parties.          Res. 30 authorized the deposition of particular witnesses and delegated to the majority and minority leaders the power to determine the deposition time for all witnesses. The resolution also empowered House managers and the president’s counsel to make a motion to resolve any objections made during the depositions after a short review period.          Democrats and Republicans alike cite the Clinton procedures as a model for what the Senate should do today. Schumer references them in a letter he sent McConnell outlining his proposal on how the trial should proceed.          McConnell appears to agree with Schumer when it comes to the benefits of the structured approach adopted by the Senate in 1999, stating that “the basic procedural framework of the Clinton impeachment trial served the Senate and the nation well, in my view…I still believe the Senate should try to follow the 1999 model.”          This agreement between McConnell and Schumer on the basic need for supplementary rules suggests that a package is likely to be approved when the Senate reconvenes after the holidays, with or without naming particular witnesses. In the unlikely event that the McConnell-Schumer talks break down, the fact that the Senate has 26 rules and a substantial body of precedents to govern its proceedings when sitting as a court of impeachment suggests that it will be able to conduct the trial.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BREAKING: Senator Hawley Drafts Motions To Subpoena Bidens, Schiff, Whistleblower</td>\n",
       "      <td>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-SC), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has drafted motions to subpoena Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, his son, Hunter Biden, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), and the Ukraine whistleblower.          “The Missouri Republican is preparing to file subpoena requests for witnesses and documents that Democrats and Republicans alike won’t want to vote on, a tactic intended to convince a handful of senators to sink a vote next week to consider new evidence in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial,” Politico reported. “Hawley’s strategy harmonizes with plans from GOP Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky to force votes to hear from Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son who was on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.”          On Twitter, Hawley wrote, “I have drafted motions to subpoena Adam Schiff, the ‘whistleblower,’ Hunter Biden, and Joe Biden to testify. If the Senate calls witnesses, I will ask for votes on all these next week.”          Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has sought to create a narrative that Senate Republicans are engaged in a cover-up because they are not allowing additional witnesses or evidence to be introduced into the trial outside of what the Democrat-controlled House already presented.          Schumer’s remarks contradict his past statements on the issue when he said that it made no sense for the Senate to call witnesses to testify when they were not called by the House.          Politico added, “Hawley would also seek communications among the whistleblower, Schiff and his staff, transcripts of [Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael] Atkinson’s congressional testimony, communications between the House impeachment managers and Democratic presidential candidates as well as documents related to Biden’s drive to oust former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin.”          Republicans kicked off their defense of Trump on Saturday in the Senate with deputy White House counsel Michael Purpura laying out the following six points that are going to be the outline of Trump’s defense:     • “The transcript shows that the president did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything. The paused security assistance funds aren’t even mentioned on the call.”     • “President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said that there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on them to review anything.”     • “President Zelensky and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did not even know, did not even know, the security assistance was paused until the end of August, over a month after the July 25 call.”     • “Not a single witness testified that the President himself said that there was any connection between any investigations and security assistance, a presidential meeting, or anything else.”     • “The security assistance flowed on September 11 and a presidential meeting took place on September 25 without the Ukrainian government announcing any investigations.”     • “The Democrats blind drive to impeach the president does not and cannot change the fact, as attested to by the Democrats own witnesses, that President Trump has been a better friend and stronger supporter of Ukraine than his predecessor.”          This report has been updated to include additional information.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Marco Rubio Hits Left's ‘Stupid’ Impeachment Games</td>\n",
       "      <td>Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) blasted Democrats’ “stupid” impeachment games on Thursday and asserted that the Senate has “no duty” to go beyond the impeachment witnesses who testified before House lawmakers.          “A Senate trial will be on the two Articles of Impeachment passed by House (if Speaker ever decides to send them over),” he continued, noting that the House voted on the articles “based on testimony of certain witnesses.”          Because of that, the “Senate has no duty to go beyond those witnesses in our trial,” Rubio concluded:          While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) had what McConnell described as a “cordial” conversation on the parameters of the looming impeachment trial prior to the new year, they did not settle their differences on how to proceed. Schumer has not relented on his demand for witnesses, particularly Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton.          “He [Schumer] wants to volunteer the Senate’s time and energy on a fishing expedition to see whether his own ideas could make Chairman Schiff’s sloppy work more persuasive than Chairman Schiff himself bothered to make it,” McConnell stated in December.          So, madame president, this concept is dead wrong. The Senate is meant to act as judge and jury to hear a trial, not to rerun the entire fact-finding investigation because angry partisans rushed sloppily through it. The trajectory that the Democratic leader apparently wants to take us down or before he’s even heard opening arguments could set a nightmare nightmarish precedent for our institution.          However, McConnell did not shut the door on impeachment witnesses altogether.          “We haven’t ruled out witnesses,” McConnell told Fox &amp; Friends in December. “We’ve said, ‘Let’s handle this case just like we did with President Clinton.’”          Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) concurred, telling Maine Public Radio on Monday that she is also open to calling witnesses.          “I am open to witnesses,” she confirmed.          “I think it’s premature to decide who should be called until we see the evidence that is presented and get the answers to the questions that we senators can submit through the Chief Justice to both sides,” she added.</td>\n",

The Senate will hold the final vote Wednesday on the two articles of impeachment.          The motion failed by a vote of 49 to 51. Democrats failed to convince four Republicans to join them in voting to allow new evidence, with just two GOP lawmakers — Senators Susan Collins and Mitt Romney — crossing the aisle.          The Senate adjourned Friday around 8 p.m. and will reconvene Monday at 11 a.m. The Senate approved Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's timeline for the rest of the trial: Closing arguments will be Monday, senators will give speeches Monday through Wednesday and the final vote will occur Wednesday.          Earlier in the day, Republicans and the president's legal team argued the introduction of new witnesses and documents would prolong the trial for weeks or months.          They also warned the move would set a precedent of the Senate conducting its own impeachment investigation, arguing the House should have exhausted its options to compel testimony before impeaching the president. Some Republicans conceded the president acted improperly by pressuring Ukraine, but said removing him from office would lead to more frequent and more partisan impeachment proceedings.          \"If this shallow, hurried and wholly partisan impeachment were to succeed, it would rip the country apart, pouring gasoline on the fire of cultural divisions that already exist,\" Senator Lamar Alexander, one of the Republicans who was on the fence, said in a statement Thursday. \"It would create the weapon of perpetual impeachment to be used against future presidents whenever the House of Representatives is of a different political party.\"          The House managers, however, warned that failing to pursue new testimony from officials like former national security adviser John Bolton would set a \"very dangerous and long-lasting precedent\" that would \"nullify\" Congress' impeachment power.          \"This will set a new precedent. This will be cited in impeachment trials from this point until the end of history,\" Schiff said. \"You can bet that in every impeachment that follows, whether it's a presidential impeachment or the impeachment of a judge, if that judge or president believes that it is to his or her advantage that there will be a trial with no witnesses, they will cite the case of Donald J. Trump.\"          New revelations by former national security adviser John Bolton hung over Friday's vote and served to punctuate Democrats' arguments. The Senate reconvened just after The New York Times reported new details from a manuscript of Bolton's upcoming book.          Bolton writes, according to The Times, that the president instructed him to call the president of Ukraine and tell him to meet with Rudy Giuliani in May 2019. Bolton's reported account is the earliest indication of the president's direct involvement in the campaign to get Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

Biden was asked about the deal during a campaign stop in Iowa, and while he admitted that the issue wasn’t “irrational” he claimed Trump’s trial centered around a “Constitutional issue,” rather than one involving his and his son’s work in Ukraine. Testifying in front of the Senate, Biden added, would turn the trial into “some kind of farce or political theater,” as if it wasn’t already headed in that direction.          Ultimately, Biden says, he wants “no part” of any deal that would require he testify so that a White House official would also take the stand.          Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz floated the idea initially but, according to reports that surfaced yesterday, a group of Senate Democrats were seriously considering a testimony trade just so that Senate Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, would cave to the idea of hosting some witness testimony during the Senate impeachment trial.          Democrats have been desperate to find some way to get witnesses on the Senate floor, ostensibly to help close holes left in the Democrats’ case against the president from the House impeachment inquiry. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) tried, valiantly, to force McConnell to welcome testimony by withholding the articles of impeachment from the Senate, but even moderate Republicans, who were the deciding factor, said they’d prefer the case be set out in full by the Senate impeachment managers.          On Tuesday, in a vote that came near midnight, the Senate voted against allowing witness testimony during the first part of Trump’s Senate trial, but several Senators — including those same moderate Republicans — reserved the right to reverse their vote if, after the two sides present their opening arguments, questions remained about the president’s behavior.          Tuesday night, Democrats met in secret to discuss the Biden for Bolton trade (though, at the time, it wasn’t clear whether they would have given up Joe Biden or his son Hunter, whose involvement in Ukrainian oil and gas company, Burisma, is at the center of what Democrats claim is a “quid-pro-quo” agreement between Trump and the Ukrainian government, foreign aid in return for an investigation into both Bidens’ roles in how Burisma was treated by Ukrainian prosecutors back during the Obama Administration.          Democrats in charge of the trial seemed reticent to ink the deal and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), one of the House’s seven “impeachment managers,” openly decried the issue, calling it “irrelevant.” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), a key “Resistance” figure in Congress added that Hunter Biden’s testimony would be “irrelevant,” and that only Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney would need to testify.          If the Senate does vote to allow witnesses, it will be up to Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, to determine which witnesses are “relevant” to the task at hand.\n",
       "800                                       Your Guide To What Happens Next With Impeachment  Now that they’ve passed an impeachment bill, Democrats are slow-walking the process in a bid to secure procedural guarantees from Senate Republicans on how the trial will unfold.          Now that the House of Representatives has voted to impeach President Trump, action shifts to the Senate, whose members are charged by the Constitution to determine whether he should be convicted or acquitted. Yet wary Democrats are slow-walking the process in a bid to secure procedural guarantees from Senate Republicans on how the trial will unfold.          The House must first appoint members who will manage its case during the trial. When that happens, the House can notify the Senate of its decision to impeach the president and appoint managers.          According to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House will refrain from appointing managers until Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., agree on the ground rules that will govern the trial. At issue are whether the Senate will call additional witnesses and how long the trial will last.          Schumer wants the Senate to call particular witnesses (namely those who refused to testify during the House’s impeachment inquiry). But McConnell doesn’t think witnesses are needed and wants the trial wrapped up quickly.          Notwithstanding the McConnell-Schumer impasse, the House’s decision to appoint managers and notify the Senate is a major development. It formally begins the impeachment process under the Senate’s existing rules and practices. The Senate’s “Rules of Procedure When Sitting On Impeachment Trials” (i.e., the Impeachment Rules) stipulate clearly that senators must consider articles of impeachment once they arrive from the House. In short, the Senate must hold a trial; senators must act.          According to Rule II of the Impeachment Rules, proceedings begin as soon as the House managers arrive at “the bar of the Senate” to exhibit their articles of impeachment against President Trump. After the presentation of the articles, the rules stipulate that the presiding officer informs the House managers that the Senate will notify the House when it has organized for trial. The House managers then leave the Senate.          After the withdrawal of the House managers, the impeachment rules require it to organize for the trial. The first order of business under Rule III is the need to administer oaths to senators and their presiding officer.          The Constitution (Article I, section 3, clause 6) requires the chief justice of the United States to preside in a presidential impeachment trial such as this one. In that case, Rule IV details the procedures that senators follow to administer the oaths. Specifically, the presiding officer first administers the oath mentioned above to the chief justice. The chief justice then administers the oath to senators, en bloc.          After the administration of oaths, the impeachment rules stipulate that the chief justice instructs the sergeant at arms to announce the beginning of the trial. Rule III requires the Senate to remain in session “from day to day…after the trial shall commence (unless otherwise ordered by the Senate) until final judgment shall be rendered” (Sundays excepted).          “Unless otherwise ordered by the Senate” underscores the fact that senators can adopt a different trial schedule by passing a resolution to that effect. Senators may also suspend the impeachment trial by unanimous consent to consider legislative and executive business.          Under Rule VIII, senators must issue a writ of summons setting the date on which the president must respond to the accusations against him. (The Senate also sets the date on which the House managers respond to the president’s response.) Rule XXV even prescribes the text of the summons.          Under the Senate’s regular rules (i.e., its “Standing Rules”), senators could filibuster the writ of summons. But under its impeachment rules, such dilatory tactics are prohibited to ensure that the trial is not delayed and that a verdict is reached. Rule XXIV stipulates that “all the orders and decisions may be acted upon without objection” during the trial. If senators object, “the orders and decisions shall be voted on without debate by yeas and nays….subject to the operation of Rule VII.”          Rule VII requires the presiding officer to “direct all the forms of proceedings while the Senate is sitting for the purpose of trying an impeachment.” In that capacity, senators expect the presiding officer to rule on questions of evidence (i.e., issues of relevancy, materiality, redundancy) and any “incidental questions” that may arise during the trial.          The presiding officer may rule when presented with such questions, or he may submit them directly to the Senate to be decided. If the presiding officer does rule on a question raised during the trial, any senator may appeal it and ask for a “formal vote.”          Regardless of how questions are decided, the impeachment rules prohibit debate. That means the Senate votes immediately whenever questions arise during a trial, and the side with more votes (i.e., a simple majority) wins.          While the Senate’s impeachment rules permit limited debate during closed sessions, senators are allowed only one speech each in such circumstances under the provisions of Rule XXIV. The rule also caps speeches on “interlocutory questions” at ten minutes.          The Senate may adopt supplementary rules to structure impeachment proceedings. During the 1999 Bill Clinton impeachment trial, senators approved two supplementary rules packages (S. Res. 16 and S. Res. 30). S. Res. 16 set the dates by which the president was required to respond to the articles of impeachment and by which the House managers were required to respond to the president’s response. It also set aside a 16-hour block of time for senators to question the parties.          Res. 30 authorized the deposition of particular witnesses and delegated to the majority and minority leaders the power to determine the deposition time for all witnesses. The resolution also empowered House managers and the president’s counsel to make a motion to resolve any objections made during the depositions after a short review period.          Democrats and Republicans alike cite the Clinton procedures as a model for what the Senate should do today. Schumer references them in a letter he sent McConnell outlining his proposal on how the trial should proceed.          McConnell appears to agree with Schumer when it comes to the benefits of the structured approach adopted by the Senate in 1999, stating that “the basic procedural framework of the Clinton impeachment trial served the Senate and the nation well, in my view…I still believe the Senate should try to follow the 1999 model.”          This agreement between McConnell and Schumer on the basic need for supplementary rules suggests that a package is likely to be approved when the Senate reconvenes after the holidays, with or without naming particular witnesses. In the unlikely event that the McConnell-Schumer talks break down, the fact that the Senate has 26 rules and a substantial body of precedents to govern its proceedings when sitting as a court of impeachment suggests that it will be able to conduct the trial.\n",

Josh Hawley (R-SC), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has drafted motions to subpoena Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, his son, Hunter Biden, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), and the Ukraine whistleblower.          “The Missouri Republican is preparing to file subpoena requests for witnesses and documents that Democrats and Republicans alike won’t want to vote on, a tactic intended to convince a handful of senators to sink a vote next week to consider new evidence in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial,” Politico reported. “Hawley’s strategy harmonizes with plans from GOP Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky to force votes to hear from Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son who was on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.”          On Twitter, Hawley wrote, “I have drafted motions to subpoena Adam Schiff, the ‘whistleblower,’ Hunter Biden, and Joe Biden to testify. If the Senate calls witnesses, I will ask for votes on all these next week.”          Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has sought to create a narrative that Senate Republicans are engaged in a cover-up because they are not allowing additional witnesses or evidence to be introduced into the trial outside of what the Democrat-controlled House already presented.          Schumer’s remarks contradict his past statements on the issue when he said that it made no sense for the Senate to call witnesses to testify when they were not called by the House.          Politico added, “Hawley would also seek communications among the whistleblower, Schiff and his staff, transcripts of [Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael] Atkinson’s congressional testimony, communications between the House impeachment managers and Democratic presidential candidates as well as documents related to Biden’s drive to oust former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin.”          Republicans kicked off their defense of Trump on Saturday in the Senate with deputy White House counsel Michael Purpura laying out the following six points that are going to be the outline of Trump’s defense:     • “The transcript shows that the president did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything. The paused security assistance funds aren’t even mentioned on the call.”     • “President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said that there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on them to review anything.”     • “President Zelensky and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did not even know, did not even know, the security assistance was paused until the end of August, over a month after the July 25 call.”     • “Not a single witness testified that the President himself said that there was any connection between any investigations and security assistance, a presidential meeting, or anything else.”     • “The security assistance flowed on September 11 and a presidential meeting took place on September 25 without the Ukrainian government announcing any investigations.”     • “The Democrats blind drive to impeach the president does not and cannot change the fact, as attested to by the Democrats own witnesses, that President Trump has been a better friend and stronger supporter of Ukraine than his predecessor.”          This report has been updated to include additional information.\n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) blasted Democrats’ “stupid” impeachment games on Thursday and asserted that the Senate has “no duty” to go beyond the impeachment witnesses who testified before House lawmakers.          “A Senate trial will be on the two Articles of Impeachment passed by House (if Speaker ever decides to send them over),” he continued, noting that the House voted on the articles “based on testimony of certain witnesses.”          Because of that, the “Senate has no duty to go beyond those witnesses in our trial,” Rubio concluded:          While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) had what McConnell described as a “cordial” conversation on the parameters of the looming impeachment trial prior to the new year, they did not settle their differences on how to proceed. Schumer has not relented on his demand for witnesses, particularly Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton.          “He [Schumer] wants to volunteer the Senate’s time and energy on a fishing expedition to see whether his own ideas could make Chairman Schiff’s sloppy work more persuasive than Chairman Schiff himself bothered to make it,” McConnell stated in December.          So, madame president, this concept is dead wrong. The Senate is meant to act as judge and jury to hear a trial, not to rerun the entire fact-finding investigation because angry partisans rushed sloppily through it. The trajectory that the Democratic leader apparently wants to take us down or before he’s even heard opening arguments could set a nightmare nightmarish precedent for our institution.          However, McConnell did not shut the door on impeachment witnesses altogether.          “We haven’t ruled out witnesses,” McConnell told Fox & Friends in December. “We’ve said, ‘Let’s handle this case just like we did with President Clinton.’”          Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) concurred, telling Maine Public Radio on Monday that she is also open to calling witnesses.          “I am open to witnesses,” she confirmed.          “I think it’s premature to decide who should be called until we see the evidence that is presented and get the answers to the questions that we senators can submit through the Chief Justice to both sides,” she added."

       "      <td>The truth about Sanders' Cold War comments is too complicated for cable news</td>\n",
       "      <td>This was the week that Bernie Sanders ran smack into a great American myth. That myth is that the United States nobly won the Cold War, which was a black-and-white clash between the forces of good and free enterprise (us) and the forces of evil and communism (them). Sanders’ dabbling in Cold War politics, when he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont, became campaign fodder, as he solidly assumed the frontrunner position in the Democrats’ presidential nomination race. His trips to Cuba, Nicaragua, and the Soviet Union in the 1980s and his statements back then about conditions in those countries have come under scrutiny, with Sanders’ political foes and pundits pushing a blunt message: lefty Sanders was soft on commie dictators.          At the South Carolina Democratic debate on Tuesday night, Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan raised the matter with Sanders: “You also have a track record of expressing sympathy for socialist governments in Cuba and in Nicaragua. Can Americans trust that a democratic socialist president will not give authoritarians a free pass?” Sanders replied that he has “opposed authoritarianism all over the world.” He was booed by some in the audience, and excoriated by his rivals, with Pete Buttigieg accusing Sanders of hyping “the bright side of the Castro regime” and having “a nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s.”          The chaotic back-and-forth at the debate and much of the discussion about Sanders’ past actions ignore the nuances and realities of the 1980s. This is not to say that Sanders’ views and remarks are beyond critique. But they are being slammed with little or no context.          The Ronald Reagan chapter of the Cold War was not a simple tale of right versus wrong. As Reaganite hawks embraced the militarism of the era, they increased geopolitical and nuclear tensions, and they cut deals with murderers, torturers, and drug runners. Since then, they’ve depicted this stretch as a time when a gallant Ronald Reagan bravely stared down the Evil Empire and won the day. The Berlin Wall crumbled. The Soviet Union collapsed. But it was far more complicated—and costly.          With the Reaganauts building up the nuclear arsenal and looking to deploy nuclear missiles into the heart of Europe, millions of Americans feared the East-West conflict could—purposefully or accidentally—lead to a nuclear war. It didn’t help that a Pentagon official early during Reagan’s first term downplayed the consequences of nuclear war and told a reporter, “If there are enough shovels to go around, everybody’s going to make it.” (Remember that the nuclear freeze movement mobilized people throughout the land and that Democrats battled Reagan on arms control policy.) The surrogate wars waged by Washington and Moscow in Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere contributed to the sense that a showdown could be on its way.          As the Cold Warriors pursued their crusade against the Soviet Union, they stuck to a version of the Domino Theory, which was once used to justify the United States’ misguided intervention in Vietnam. (That led to the deaths of more than 58,000 US soldiers and an estimated 3.3 million Vietnamese fighters and civilians.) So they bear-hugged anti-communist authoritarians across the globe: The anti-Semitic and fascist junta in Argentina, the apartheid regime of South Africa, the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, the murderous tyrant Augusto Pinochet in Chile, and other thugs and killers. Jeane Kirkpatrick, Reagan’s ambassador to the UN, had developed a doctrine to rationalize such behavior, claiming that right-wing authoritarian regimes were not as bad as totalitarian communist governments and, consequently, the United States could work with non-communist dictators who were favorably inclined toward the United States—even as they disappeared and tortured their own citizens and crushed dissent.          An unknown number—hundreds of thousands?—of civilians in these countries paid the ultimate price for this geostrategic dance with the devil(s). One notable and horrific example: Washington, looking to buttress anti-communist allies in Central America, financed and trained the military of El Salvador, which butchered 1,200 civilians at El Mozote in 1981 and engaged in other atrocities. Earlier, the National Guard there had raped and murdered four American nuns, and Archbishop Oscar Romero was assassinated after asking the United States to halt military aid to the country. (Elliott Abrams, then a senior Reagan administration official, helped cover up the El Mozote massacre. Today, he’s a top envoy for President Trump.) In nearby Nicaragua, the Reagan administration backed the Contra rebels fighting the nation’s socialist Sandinista government, disregarding reports of Contra human rights abuses and drug running. (The Sandinistas in 1979 had overthrown the corrupt and tyrannical reign of Anastasio Somoza, who had ruled with American support.) Washington gave a green-light to bloodshed, torture, and corruption around the world—for corruption, see the case of Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire—as long as the perps claimed to be part of the war on communism. And it fixated on Fidel Castro in Cuba, continuing a decades-old economic blockade that failed to dislodge the communist dictator but that did punish the people of Cuba.          In this environment of nuclear fear and bloody bargains, progressives such as Sanders looked for a way out. They sought to make citizen-to-citizen connections with countries in Washington’s crosshairs to diminish tensions and counter the demonization of these countries pushed by the hawks. So Sanders as mayor developed a “sister city” relationship with Yaroslavl, a Russian city of 600,000 on the Volga River. And he traveled there in 1988 shortly after he was married. (That’s why he referred to this trip as a “very strange honeymoon.”) He visited Cuba in 1989 and proposed a sister-city relationship with Havana. And in 1985, he traveled to Nicaragua, as a fierce opponent of the Contra war, at a time when many Americans and many Democrats in Congress also opposed the Reagan administration’s support of the Contras.          Sanders’ particular actions and statements related to these visits are fair game. Was he too soft on Castro? Sanders did seem mostly focused on advances in literacy and health care in Cuba since Castro and his rebels booted out the brutal military dictator Fulgencio Batista. After returning from Cuba in 1989, Sanders told a local Vermont paper that Cuba “is not a perfect society” but that he saw merit in the Cuban argument that Americans could not be truly “free” in a society with homelessness and hunger. “The question is how you bring both economic and political freedom together in one society,” Sanders said. And he hailed the Cuban revolution for encouraging people to work for the common good and noted that in a region where many people are oppressed and starving, “Cuba is a model of what a society could be.”          While in Nicargaua, Sanders attended a rally, where the audience chanted, “Here, there, everywhere, the Yankee will die.” (Sanders has said he did not remember hearing this anti-American chant.) But his trip to Nicaragua was part of what he had described as an effort—”in at least some small way”—to “play a role in reversing President Reagan’s policies in Central America” and ending the war there.          Sanders’ trip to the Soviet Union is easy to mock. There is video of him dancing and also—shirtless—singing “This Land Is Your Land” to his hosts after a stint in a sauna. But this visit was motivated by a concern similar to what had led him to Nicaragua. As Sanders explained a year before making that trek, “By encouraging citizen-to-citizen exchanges—of young people, artists and musicians, business people, public officials, and just plain ordinary citizens, we can break down the barriers and stereotypes which exist between the Soviet Union and the United States.” Upon his return, he pointed out positive elements of Soviet life he had witnessed—after-school programs, low rents—but he also acknowledged the down sides (problems with food availability, antiquated medical technology).          It is true that during and after these trips Sanders did not assail the governments of these countries or denounce their repressive ways. He did not blast away at the Soviet, Cuban, and Nicaraguan regimes. (At the time, Daniel Ortega, then and now the leader of Nicaragua, was not yet the corrupt autocrat he later became.) Sanders, like many progressives at the time, was looking to make connections in the countries targeted by the Reaganauts and create a citizens’ foreign policy. He was attempting to subvert those Reagan policies that exacerbated conflict, intensified the arms race, contributed to violence and human rights abuses, and financed wars. In the case of Nicaragua, Congress restrained Reagan’s efforts to assist the Contras. But then the White House arguably broke the law by secretly funneling aid to the Contras, which included the funds raised by its covert and also arguably illegal sales of arms to Iran.          None of this is to say Sanders made the right judgments in every instance. He probably swung too far in the other direction while attempting to counter the ends-justify-the-means Cold Warriors. (An editorial in a Vermont paper called Sanders “a long-time admirer of Fidel Castro and what he has done for the Cuban people.” Sanders did say at the time that he wanted to meet Castro, who clearly was a dictator.) At the time, as progressives justifiably criticized Reagan’s policies regarding Nicaragua, Cuba, and the Soviet Union, there was a tendency within some quarters of the left to be too forgiving of Castro, the Sandinistas, and others and an inclination not to dump on regimes in Latin America and elsewhere that were opposing US interventionism. That’s something that Sanders has to address (even as Trump gets away with making nice with tyrannical brutes around the world, including Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Rodrigo Duterte, Mohammed bin Salman, and others).          Sanders’ interactions with these nations and his remarks from those days are part of a larger tale. He was a committed foe of the Cold War and its hawks. Opposing Reagan’s secret and not-too-secret wars in Central America and elsewhere was virtuous. Looking to diminish the tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States with people-to-people diplomacy was commendable. In these endeavors, Sanders was on the right side of history. But as with some on the left, Sanders did not focus on the anti-democratic foundations of the Soviet Union and Cuba, in part because the Cold Warriors themselves were already demonizing these societies in war-mongering fashion. Consequently, Sanders is now vulnerable to slashing and simplistic attacks that depict him as a sucker for lefty dictators. The world—then and now—is far more complex than that. But if this assault continues, the challenge for Sanders will be to explain his positions of the past and convey the larger myth-busting story of the Cold War—which is tough to do in short sound bites or on a chaotic debate stage. And doing so may well become a big—and an appropriate—test for this presidential candidate.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\"Our economic challenges will be conquered not by force, but by cooperation and mutual respect,\" Johnson says in one of the ads. \"For the independent majority of Americans who feel as I do, I say: Why wait one more day?\"          At the rally itself, Sanders continued making the pitch he's been honing since he returned to the campaign trail: This isn't a year to vote third party. Mentioning Clinton's name sparingly, Sanders told several hundred voters — many still wearing gear from the Democratic primary — that their votes could stop the election of a Republican \"who thinks climate change is a hoax.\"          Sanders, who was the most prominent independent in American politics even before his run, is gradually embracing a role as a third-party critic, a spoiler of the spoilers. As Democrats contemplate ways to tamp down a protest vote for Johnson, or for the Green Party's Jill Stein, Sanders is already arguing that anyone who voted for him would set the movement back by voting against Clinton. In an interview after the rally — the first in a three-state weekend tour for Democratic candidates — Sanders said that Democrats and the media need to focus on Clinton's actual policies more than they have been, in a campaign dominated by back-and-forths about Trump's gaffes.          \"This is not the time for a protest vote, in terms of a presidential campaign,\" Sanders said. \"I ran as a third-party candidate. I'm the longest-serving independent in the history of the United States Congress. I know more about third-party politics than anyone else in the Congress, okay? And if people want to run as third-party candidates, God bless them! Run for Congress. Run for governor. Run for state legislature. When we're talking about president of the United States, in my own personal view, this is not time for a protest vote. This is time to elect Hillary Clinton and then work after the election to mobilize millions of people to make sure she can be the most progressive president she can be.\"          The journey from Clinton primary foe to Clinton surrogate has been awkward for Sanders. At high-profile moments during the Democratic National Convention, including an address to his delegates, he mentioned his endorsement near the top of his remarks and was blown back by jeers and boos. Since then, Sanders has tucked his endorsement later in his speeches, after rundowns of exactly what concessions his campaign got from the Democratic Party, and what a Trump presidency would undo.          That spoonful-of-sugar approach has led to less obvious backlash; it's also truer to Sanders's long-term goals. His campaign performed most strongly in \"open\" primaries and caucuses, where independent voters could play without registering as Democrats. He did worse than expected in New York, and cited the state's onerous registration standards, which require voters to be members of a party for six months before voting in their primaries. The state's Working Families Party, which endorsed and organized for Sanders, found itself in a bind.          In the run-up to the Democratic convention, Sanders unsuccessfully lobbied for the party to open all of its primaries to all voters. Since then, he has confirmed that he will seek reelection as an independent. And on Thursday night, Sanders keynoted the 18th annual Working Families Party gala, mentioning Clinton's name just twice in the context of his \"political revolution.\" One of those times, Sanders beseeched anyone who backed Clinton \"to vote for her on the Working Families Party line.\"          New York's unique \"fusion\" laws, which allow candidates to seek multiple party nominations and aggregate their votes toward a winning total, give Sanders the opportunity to back Clinton while growing a force outside the Democratic Party. In two-dozen interviews at the New Paltz rally, four voters said they had contemplated voting for a third party but were rethinking that after polls showed Trump gaining ground.          Eli Campbell, 21, arrived at the rally with a photoshopped portrait of Trump and Clinton wearing crowns in front of the White House. (The original photo was taken at Trump's wedding to his third and current wife, Melania, which Clinton attended.) \"People like me have been told that it doesn't matter if we want a world that works,\" said Campbell, as other voters, many from the nearby university, snapped photos. \"We have to wait for it.\"          Campbell said he was leaning toward supporting Stein, but he, too, had seen polling that suggested Trump might win the presidency. If it seemed that his vote would be decisive, Campbell admitted that he could vote for Clinton.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Tim Miller, once a spokesman for the RNC and a former strategist for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, joined the hosts of medianame News' \"Powerhouse Politics\" podcast on Wednesday, offering his insight on the neck-and-neck race between 2020 Democrats -- Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden -- ahead of the Iowa caucuses.          Miller said the anti-establishment campaign run by Sanders has brought him déjà vu -- reminding him in many ways of then-candidate Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.          \"Obviously there are many differences between Bernie and Trump from a policy standpoint, but kind of the animating features of their campaign and what is appealing to them is very much a deja vu,\" Miller told the hosts, medianame News' Political Director Rick Klein and Chief White House Correspondent Johnathan Karl. \" I think there is very much deja vu at the state of the Democratic Party and how kind of the inmates are taking over the asylum and the establishment.\"          In a recent article for his advocacy group's protect \"The Bullwark,\" Miller laid out the influence anti-establishment candidates in the past have had on the 2020 Democratic candidates.          \"His supporters come from pockets of the country and the Internet that have been rejected or mocked by many of these status makers,\" he said of Sanders in his article, adding that the anti-establishment movement \"creates new types of political celebrities who would be totally unrecognizable to your average news consumer.\"          Miller said watching the establishment Democrats, such as Biden, working to stop Sanders from clinching the nomination reminds him of his former RNC position.          \"I lived making those phone calls to, you know, Republican establishment figures, asking them to speak out,\" Miller said. \"And, you know, by the time folks really wanted to act against Trump, it was too late.          The hosts again turned to his article, asking Miller about his belief that a \"ghost\" of Utah Sen. Mitt Romney was haunting Biden, and if he thought the 2020 candidate could find himself falling into the same path as Romney -- a favorite of the establishment in 2012 -- who was later defeated by former President Barack Obama.          Klein also pointed out that despite arguments rising at debates and among campaign ads, the gloves between Democrats have stayed on for the most part.          In response, Miller said the nomination ultimately depends on the circumstances: What are the other candidates doing?          \"When you look at this primary, the question is, can Biden go follow that Romney path with the help of maybe [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren staying around a little bit longer than she should ... or does Biden kind of fall victim to, you know, what the sort of established Republicans saw in 2016, which was a lot of infighting and jockeying while the populist insurgent Trump, And in this case, Bernie, you know, run away with the nomination.\"          He added, \"I think that's where the decisions that [Sen.] Amy Klobuchar makes that [former New York mayor] Mike Bloomberg may actually be more important than people realize.\"          Biden may be the last of his type of Democrat, Klein pointed out, as Democratic voters seem to be more attracted to the insurgent or populist movement surrounding candidates like Sanders.          Miller seemed to agree, again drawing contrast between the 2016 Trump campaign and Sanders' ongoing campaign.          \"We as establishment figures were trying to figure out how do we kind of tame this bear,\" he said of Trump's 2016 campaign, adding \"How do we throw them enough red meat while kind of maintaining the principles and responsibilities that we feel like we should?\"          He told the hosts that the Democrats will have to go through the same journey, but will have to co-opt it in a more effective way than the RNC did in 2012 and in 2016.          \"Does Bernie have a path to the presidency? Absolutely,\" he said, adding that Sanders would first have to take back the Midwestern states he's lost.          He added, \"So, anyway, short answer, yes, he can win.\"          But he said Biden too could win, especially if he were to pick up the voters that Sanders left behind.          Biden has recently touted himself as the safest option to face Trump in a new campaign ad, warning voters that \"this is no time to take a risk.\"          A recent medianame/Washington Post poll also shows that economic prosperity is giving Trump a boost as he closely trails behind many of the 2020 Democratic candidates, including Biden and Sanders.          The poll on Trump's performance comes in the midst of the ongoing Senate impeachment trial.

       "      <td>The American Left dreams of importing the Nordic social system — but how accurate is their caricature?          Although Bernie Sanders failed to win the Democratic presidential nomination, the Vermont senator’s campaign did succeed in mobilizing thousands of progressive activists. Their energy and support seems closely connected to Sanders’s quest to introduce a Nordic-style welfare model in the United States. As Sanders explained at the very first Democratic debate last October, “I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people.”          But it’s evident that the left wing of the Democratic party would also push for these ideas under a future Hillary Clinton administration. Indeed, Ezra Klein, the editor of the liberal news website Vox, wrote last fall that “Clinton and Sanders both want to make America look a lot more like Denmark — they both want to pass generous parental leave policies, let the government bargain down drug prices, and strengthen the social safety net.”          The current president and the last Democratic president share this vision, too. In his book Back to Work (2011), Bill Clinton argues that Finland, Sweden, and Norway offer greater opportunities for individuals to climb the social ladder than the U.S. does. Barack Obama recently gathered the leaders of the Nordic countries in Washington, explaining that “in a world of growing economic disparities, Nordic countries have some of the least income inequality in the world — which may explain one of the reasons that they’re some of the happiest people in the world.”          It is not difficult to grasp the American Left’s admiration for Nordic-style democratic socialism. These countries combine relatively high living standards with low poverty, long life spans, and narrow income distributions — everything the Left would like America to have. There is, however, a simple fact that seems to have escaped those who idealize Nordic-style social democracy. As I show in my forthcoming book Debunking Utopia: Exposing the Myth of Nordic Socialism, the social success of Nordic countries pre-dates progressive welfare-state policies.          A common misconception is that the Nordic countries became socially and economically successful by introducing universal welfare states funded by high taxes. In fact, their economic and social success had already materialized during a period when these countries combined a small public sector with free-market policies. The welfare state was introduced afterward. That the Nordic countries are so successful is due to an exceptional culture that emphasizes social cohesion, hard work, and individual responsibility.          Today, in contrast, Nordic countries stand out as having high-tax models. Denmark, for example, has the highest tax rate among developed nations. But in 1960, the tax rate in the country was merely 25 percent of GDP, lower than the 27 percent rate in the U.S. at the time. In Sweden, the rate was 29 percent, only slightly higher than in the U.S. In fact, much of Nordic prosperity evolved between the time that a capitalist model was introduced in this part of the world during the late 19th century and the mid 20th century – during the free-market era.          What might come as a surprise to American admirers of the Nordic countries is that high levels of income equality evolved during the same period. Swedish economists Jesper Roine and Daniel Waldenström, for example, explain that “most of the decrease [in income inequality in Sweden] takes place before the expansion of the welfare state and by 1950 Swedish top income shares were already lower than in other countries.” A recent paper by economists Anthony Barnes Atkinson and Jakob Egholt Søgaard reaches a similar conclusion for Denmark and Norway.          Cultural norms and mores are hugely important in a country’s development — the Scandinavian countries are a prime example. In modern management literature, people from the Nordic countries are described as honest and hard-working. Attitude studies show that they have unusually high levels of societal trust. Historic sources tell us that these attributes were already evident among the Nordic people centuries ago. While some scholars attribute this to the Protestant work ethic, it is likely that climate played an equally important role in creating the Nordic success culture. Nordic farmers owned their land but struggled to survive in the unforgiving climate of Scandinavia. In order to thrive, these homogenous societies developed strict work ethics, healthy lifestyles, and a code of individual responsibility out of necessity. To paraphrase the ancient Persian king Cyrus the Great, hard lands breed hard people.          American admirers of Nordic-style social democracy argue that by copying social-democratic policies, the U.S. will copy Nordic social success. But is this true?          In 1960, well before large welfare states had been created in Nordic countries, Swedes lived 3.2 years longer than Americans, while Norwegians lived 3.8 years longer and Danes 2.4 years longer. Today, after the Nordic countries have introduced universal health care, the difference has shrunk to 2.9 years in Sweden, 2.6 years in Norway, and 1.5 years in Denmark. The differences in life span have actually shrunk as Nordic countries moved from a small public sector to a democratic-socialist model with universal health coverage. Moreover, the longest average life spans among Nordic peoples are found in Iceland — the small Nordic cousin that has the most distinctly Nordic culture, but also the most limited welfare system.          It is equally interesting to look at Nordic Americans, a group that combines the Nordic success culture with U.S.-style capitalism. It was mainly the impoverished people in the Nordic countries who sailed across the Atlantic to found new lives. And yet, as I write in my book, Danish Americans today have fully 55 percent higher living standard than Danes. Similarly, Swedish Americans have a 53 percent higher living standard than Swedes. The gap is even greater, 59 percent, between Finnish Americans and Finns. Even though Norwegian Americans lack the oil wealth of Norway, they have a 3 percent higher living standard than their cousins overseas.          Perhaps even more astonishing is that Nordic Americans are more socially successful than their cousins in Scandinavia. They have much lower high-school-dropout rates, much lower unemployment rates, and even slightly lower poverty rates. Similarly, immigrants to the Nordic countries fare worse than those to the U.S. with regard to employment, self-reported health, and the school results of their children.          In short: What the American Left admires about the Nordic countries clearly has less to do with their social-democratic welfare states than with the exceptional culture in these historically Protestant societies.          Currently, Nordic-style democratic socialism is all the rage among Democrat activists as well as with liberal intellectuals and journalists. But in the Nordic countries themselves, this ideal has gradually lost its appeal. Only one of the five Nordic countries, Sweden, currently has a government headed by social democrats. The other four countries have center-right governments. Moreover, the Swedish Social Democrats enjoy weaker popular support today than at any point in modern times. They lead a minority government, as the majority of Swedes either support one of the center-right parties or the anti-immigration party.          During the past few decades, the Nordic countries have gradually been reforming their social systems. Taxes have been cut to stimulate work, public benefits have been limited in order to reduce welfare dependency, pension savings have been partially privatized, for-profit forces have been allowed in the welfare sector, and state monopolies have been opened up to the market. In short, the universal-welfare-state model is being liberalized. Even the social-democratic parties themselves realize the need for change.          Curiously, the American admirers of Nordic-style democratic socialism pay no heed to any of these facts. For them, the Nordic countries serve as a Shangri-La, a promised land reachable through generous welfare policies, high taxes, government redistribution, and a massively expanded public sector. Never mind that a closer look shows that these policies are not what explain the success of Nordic societies, and that the Nordic people themselves are becoming less enthusiastic about democratic socialism. Unfortunately, the American Left is more interested in the Nordic myth than a nuanced view of the actual benefits — and drawbacks — of democratic socialism.</td>\n",

       "      <td>MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa — Bernie Sanders found himself on the receiving end of attacks from both President Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren on Sunday, a reflection of his rising status in the Democratic presidential race and perceived momentum just three weeks out from the Iowa caucuses.          In a tweet, Trump declared, “Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party. So what does this all mean? Stay tuned!” Sanders responded in the same medium: “It means you’re going to lose.”          But it was Warren – who has generally avoided criticizing her fellow progressive over the course of the Democratic primary – who offered the sharpest criticism of the Vermont senator, saying she was “disappointed” by a report that the Sanders‘ campaign is instructing its volunteers to speak negatively about her to win over undecided voters and suggesting he is too divisive to beat Trump.          “We cannot nominate someone who takes big chunks of the Democratic coalition for granted. We need someone who will bring our party together,” she told reporters after a campaign event in Iowa.          “We need someone who will excite every part of the Democratic Party, someone who will be there, someone that every Democrat can believe in.”          Warren also warned against repeating “the factionalism of 2016,” during which the unexpected strength of Sanders‘ challenge to Hillary Clinton’s candidacy produced a drawn-out and oftentimes nasty Democratic primary fight that some Democrats say contributed to Trump’s win.          Her comments come in response to a report in Politico revealing the Sanders campaign canvassing script suggests volunteers tell voters leaning towards Warren that “people who support her are highly-educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what” and that the senator is “bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party.”          The Warren campaign cited the Politico report in a fundraising appeal Sunday night, saying that “we can’t afford to repeat the factionalism of the 2016 primary.”          Both Sanders and Warren, who are vying for the progressive lane in the primary and largely agree on many of the biggest issues in the race, have up until now publicly avoided attacking one another and in fact have been complimentary of each other.          In contrast, Sanders has in recent weeks been going aggressively after opponent Joe Biden for his support for the Iraq War and his trade policy.          While Biden has largely stayed mum on Sanders‘ attacks in recent days, Warren’s broadside sets the potential for a debate-stage clash in which he’ll likely be attacked by multiple opponents. The Vermont senator has been rising in a handful of state and national polls over the past month and is seen to have momentum heading into the final three weeks before the first nominating contest takes place in Iowa.</td>\n",

       "44   This was the week that Bernie Sanders ran smack into a great American myth. That myth is that the United States nobly won the Cold War, which was a black-and-white clash between the forces of good and free enterprise (us) and the forces of evil and communism (them). Sanders’ dabbling in Cold War politics, when he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont, became campaign fodder, as he solidly assumed the frontrunner position in the Democrats’ presidential nomination race. His trips to Cuba, Nicaragua, and the Soviet Union in the 1980s and his statements back then about conditions in those countries have come under scrutiny, with Sanders’ political foes and pundits pushing a blunt message: lefty Sanders was soft on commie dictators.          At the South Carolina Democratic debate on Tuesday night, Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan raised the matter with Sanders: “You also have a track record of expressing sympathy for socialist governments in Cuba and in Nicaragua. Can Americans trust that a democratic socialist president will not give authoritarians a free pass?” Sanders replied that he has “opposed authoritarianism all over the world.” He was booed by some in the audience, and excoriated by his rivals, with Pete Buttigieg accusing Sanders of hyping “the bright side of the Castro regime” and having “a nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s.”          The chaotic back-and-forth at the debate and much of the discussion about Sanders’ past actions ignore the nuances and realities of the 1980s. This is not to say that Sanders’ views and remarks are beyond critique. But they are being slammed with little or no context.          The Ronald Reagan chapter of the Cold War was not a simple tale of right versus wrong. As Reaganite hawks embraced the militarism of the era, they increased geopolitical and nuclear tensions, and they cut deals with murderers, torturers, and drug runners. Since then, they’ve depicted this stretch as a time when a gallant Ronald Reagan bravely stared down the Evil Empire and won the day. The Berlin Wall crumbled. The Soviet Union collapsed. But it was far more complicated—and costly.          With the Reaganauts building up the nuclear arsenal and looking to deploy nuclear missiles into the heart of Europe, millions of Americans feared the East-West conflict could—purposefully or accidentally—lead to a nuclear war. It didn’t help that a Pentagon official early during Reagan’s first term downplayed the consequences of nuclear war and told a reporter, “If there are enough shovels to go around, everybody’s going to make it.” (Remember that the nuclear freeze movement mobilized people throughout the land and that Democrats battled Reagan on arms control policy.) The surrogate wars waged by Washington and Moscow in Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere contributed to the sense that a showdown could be on its way.          As the Cold Warriors pursued their crusade against the Soviet Union, they stuck to a version of the Domino Theory, which was once used to justify the United States’ misguided intervention in Vietnam. (That led to the deaths of more than 58,000 US soldiers and an estimated 3.3 million Vietnamese fighters and civilians.) So they bear-hugged anti-communist authoritarians across the globe: The anti-Semitic and fascist junta in Argentina, the apartheid regime of South Africa, the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, the murderous tyrant Augusto Pinochet in Chile, and other thugs and killers. Jeane Kirkpatrick, Reagan’s ambassador to the UN, had developed a doctrine to rationalize such behavior, claiming that right-wing authoritarian regimes were not as bad as totalitarian communist governments and, consequently, the United States could work with non-communist dictators who were favorably inclined toward the United States—even as they disappeared and tortured their own citizens and crushed dissent.          An unknown number—hundreds of thousands?—of civilians in these countries paid the ultimate price for this geostrategic dance with the devil(s). One notable and horrific example: Washington, looking to buttress anti-communist allies in Central America, financed and trained the military of El Salvador, which butchered 1,200 civilians at El Mozote in 1981 and engaged in other atrocities. Earlier, the National Guard there had raped and murdered four American nuns, and Archbishop Oscar Romero was assassinated after asking the United States to halt military aid to the country. (Elliott Abrams, then a senior Reagan administration official, helped cover up the El Mozote massacre. Today, he’s a top envoy for President Trump.) In nearby Nicaragua, the Reagan administration backed the Contra rebels fighting the nation’s socialist Sandinista government, disregarding reports of Contra human rights abuses and drug running. (The Sandinistas in 1979 had overthrown the corrupt and tyrannical reign of Anastasio Somoza, who had ruled with American support.) Washington gave a green-light to bloodshed, torture, and corruption around the world—for corruption, see the case of Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire—as long as the perps claimed to be part of the war on communism. And it fixated on Fidel Castro in Cuba, continuing a decades-old economic blockade that failed to dislodge the communist dictator but that did punish the people of Cuba.          In this environment of nuclear fear and bloody bargains, progressives such as Sanders looked for a way out. They sought to make citizen-to-citizen connections with countries in Washington’s crosshairs to diminish tensions and counter the demonization of these countries pushed by the hawks. So Sanders as mayor developed a “sister city” relationship with Yaroslavl, a Russian city of 600,000 on the Volga River. And he traveled there in 1988 shortly after he was married. (That’s why he referred to this trip as a “very strange honeymoon.”) He visited Cuba in 1989 and proposed a sister-city relationship with Havana. And in 1985, he traveled to Nicaragua, as a fierce opponent of the Contra war, at a time when many Americans and many Democrats in Congress also opposed the Reagan administration’s support of the Contras.          Sanders’ particular actions and statements related to these visits are fair game. Was he too soft on Castro? Sanders did seem mostly focused on advances in literacy and health care in Cuba since Castro and his rebels booted out the brutal military dictator Fulgencio Batista. After returning from Cuba in 1989, Sanders told a local Vermont paper that Cuba “is not a perfect society” but that he saw merit in the Cuban argument that Americans could not be truly “free” in a society with homelessness and hunger. “The question is how you bring both economic and political freedom together in one society,” Sanders said. And he hailed the Cuban revolution for encouraging people to work for the common good and noted that in a region where many people are oppressed and starving, “Cuba is a model of what a society could be.”          While in Nicargaua, Sanders attended a rally, where the audience chanted, “Here, there, everywhere, the Yankee will die.” (Sanders has said he did not remember hearing this anti-American chant.) But his trip to Nicaragua was part of what he had described as an effort—”in at least some small way”—to “play a role in reversing President Reagan’s policies in Central America” and ending the war there.          Sanders’ trip to the Soviet Union is easy to mock. There is video of him dancing and also—shirtless—singing “This Land Is Your Land” to his hosts after a stint in a sauna. But this visit was motivated by a concern similar to what had led him to Nicaragua. As Sanders explained a year before making that trek, “By encouraging citizen-to-citizen exchanges—of young people, artists and musicians, business people, public officials, and just plain ordinary citizens, we can break down the barriers and stereotypes which exist between the Soviet Union and the United States.” Upon his return, he pointed out positive elements of Soviet life he had witnessed—after-school programs, low rents—but he also acknowledged the down sides (problems with food availability, antiquated medical technology).          It is true that during and after these trips Sanders did not assail the governments of these countries or denounce their repressive ways. He did not blast away at the Soviet, Cuban, and Nicaraguan regimes. (At the time, Daniel Ortega, then and now the leader of Nicaragua, was not yet the corrupt autocrat he later became.) Sanders, like many progressives at the time, was looking to make connections in the countries targeted by the Reaganauts and create a citizens’ foreign policy. He was attempting to subvert those Reagan policies that exacerbated conflict, intensified the arms race, contributed to violence and human rights abuses, and financed wars. In the case of Nicaragua, Congress restrained Reagan’s efforts to assist the Contras. But then the White House arguably broke the law by secretly funneling aid to the Contras, which included the funds raised by its covert and also arguably illegal sales of arms to Iran.          None of this is to say Sanders made the right judgments in every instance. He probably swung too far in the other direction while attempting to counter the ends-justify-the-means Cold Warriors. (An editorial in a Vermont paper called Sanders “a long-time admirer of Fidel Castro and what he has done for the Cuban people.” Sanders did say at the time that he wanted to meet Castro, who clearly was a dictator.) At the time, as progressives justifiably criticized Reagan’s policies regarding Nicaragua, Cuba, and the Soviet Union, there was a tendency within some quarters of the left to be too forgiving of Castro, the Sandinistas, and others and an inclination not to dump on regimes in Latin America and elsewhere that were opposing US interventionism. That’s something that Sanders has to address (even as Trump gets away with making nice with tyrannical brutes around the world, including Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Rodrigo Duterte, Mohammed bin Salman, and others).          Sanders’ interactions with these nations and his remarks from those days are part of a larger tale. He was a committed foe of the Cold War and its hawks. Opposing Reagan’s secret and not-too-secret wars in Central America and elsewhere was virtuous. Looking to diminish the tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States with people-to-people diplomacy was commendable. In these endeavors, Sanders was on the right side of history. But as with some on the left, Sanders did not focus on the anti-democratic foundations of the Soviet Union and Cuba, in part because the Cold Warriors themselves were already demonizing these societies in war-mongering fashion. Consequently, Sanders is now vulnerable to slashing and simplistic attacks that depict him as a sucker for lefty dictators. The world—then and now—is far more complex than that. But if this assault continues, the challenge for Sanders will be to explain his positions of the past and convey the larger myth-busting story of the Cold War—which is tough to do in short sound bites or on a chaotic debate stage. And doing so may well become a big—and an appropriate—test for this presidential candidate.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \"Our economic challenges will be conquered not by force, but by cooperation and mutual respect,\" Johnson says in one of the ads. \"For the independent majority of Americans who feel as I do, I say: Why wait one more day?\"          At the rally itself, Sanders continued making the pitch he's been honing since he returned to the campaign trail: This isn't a year to vote third party. Mentioning Clinton's name sparingly, Sanders told several hundred voters — many still wearing gear from the Democratic primary — that their votes could stop the election of a Republican \"who thinks climate change is a hoax.\"          Sanders, who was the most prominent independent in American politics even before his run, is gradually embracing a role as a third-party critic, a spoiler of the spoilers. As Democrats contemplate ways to tamp down a protest vote for Johnson, or for the Green Party's Jill Stein, Sanders is already arguing that anyone who voted for him would set the movement back by voting against Clinton. In an interview after the rally — the first in a three-state weekend tour for Democratic candidates — Sanders said that Democrats and the media need to focus on Clinton's actual policies more than they have been, in a campaign dominated by back-and-forths about Trump's gaffes.          \"This is not the time for a protest vote, in terms of a presidential campaign,\" Sanders said. \"I ran as a third-party candidate. I'm the longest-serving independent in the history of the United States Congress. I know more about third-party politics than anyone else in the Congress, okay? And if people want to run as third-party candidates, God bless them! Run for Congress. Run for governor. Run for state legislature. When we're talking about president of the United States, in my own personal view, this is not time for a protest vote. This is time to elect Hillary Clinton and then work after the election to mobilize millions of people to make sure she can be the most progressive president she can be.\"          The journey from Clinton primary foe to Clinton surrogate has been awkward for Sanders. At high-profile moments during the Democratic National Convention, including an address to his delegates, he mentioned his endorsement near the top of his remarks and was blown back by jeers and boos. Since then, Sanders has tucked his endorsement later in his speeches, after rundowns of exactly what concessions his campaign got from the Democratic Party, and what a Trump presidency would undo.          That spoonful-of-sugar approach has led to less obvious backlash; it's also truer to Sanders's long-term goals. His campaign performed most strongly in \"open\" primaries and caucuses, where independent voters could play without registering as Democrats. He did worse than expected in New York, and cited the state's onerous registration standards, which require voters to be members of a party for six months before voting in their primaries. The state's Working Families Party, which endorsed and organized for Sanders, found itself in a bind.          In the run-up to the Democratic convention, Sanders unsuccessfully lobbied for the party to open all of its primaries to all voters. Since then, he has confirmed that he will seek reelection as an independent. And on Thursday night, Sanders keynoted the 18th annual Working Families Party gala, mentioning Clinton's name just twice in the context of his \"political revolution.\" One of those times, Sanders beseeched anyone who backed Clinton \"to vote for her on the Working Families Party line.\"          New York's unique \"fusion\" laws, which allow candidates to seek multiple party nominations and aggregate their votes toward a winning total, give Sanders the opportunity to back Clinton while growing a force outside the Democratic Party. In two-dozen interviews at the New Paltz rally, four voters said they had contemplated voting for a third party but were rethinking that after polls showed Trump gaining ground.          Eli Campbell, 21, arrived at the rally with a photoshopped portrait of Trump and Clinton wearing crowns in front of the White House. (The original photo was taken at Trump's wedding to his third and current wife, Melania, which Clinton attended.) \"People like me have been told that it doesn't matter if we want a world that works,\" said Campbell, as other voters, many from the nearby university, snapped photos. \"We have to wait for it.\"          Campbell said he was leaning toward supporting Stein, but he, too, had seen polling that suggested Trump might win the presidency. If it seemed that his vote would be decisive, Campbell admitted that he could vote for Clinton.  \n",

                                                                                         Tim Miller, once a spokesman for the RNC and a former strategist for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, joined the hosts of medianame News' \"Powerhouse Politics\" podcast on Wednesday, offering his insight on the neck-and-neck race between 2020 Democrats -- Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden -- ahead of the Iowa caucuses.          Miller said the anti-establishment campaign run by Sanders has brought him déjà vu -- reminding him in many ways of then-candidate Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.          \"Obviously there are many differences between Bernie and Trump from a policy standpoint, but kind of the animating features of their campaign and what is appealing to them is very much a deja vu,\" Miller told the hosts, medianame News' Political Director Rick Klein and Chief White House Correspondent Johnathan Karl. \" I think there is very much deja vu at the state of the Democratic Party and how kind of the inmates are taking over the asylum and the establishment.\"          In a recent article for his advocacy group's protect \"The Bullwark,\" Miller laid out the influence anti-establishment candidates in the past have had on the 2020 Democratic candidates.          \"His supporters come from pockets of the country and the Internet that have been rejected or mocked by many of these status makers,\" he said of Sanders in his article, adding that the anti-establishment movement \"creates new types of political celebrities who would be totally unrecognizable to your average news consumer.\"          Miller said watching the establishment Democrats, such as Biden, working to stop Sanders from clinching the nomination reminds him of his former RNC position.          \"I lived making those phone calls to, you know, Republican establishment figures, asking them to speak out,\" Miller said. \"And, you know, by the time folks really wanted to act against Trump, it was too late.          The hosts again turned to his article, asking Miller about his belief that a \"ghost\" of Utah Sen. Mitt Romney was haunting Biden, and if he thought the 2020 candidate could find himself falling into the same path as Romney -- a favorite of the establishment in 2012 -- who was later defeated by former President Barack Obama.          Klein also pointed out that despite arguments rising at debates and among campaign ads, the gloves between Democrats have stayed on for the most part.          In response, Miller said the nomination ultimately depends on the circumstances: What are the other candidates doing?          \"When you look at this primary, the question is, can Biden go follow that Romney path with the help of maybe [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren staying around a little bit longer than she should ... or does Biden kind of fall victim to, you know, what the sort of established Republicans saw in 2016, which was a lot of infighting and jockeying while the populist insurgent Trump, And in this case, Bernie, you know, run away with the nomination.\"          He added, \"I think that's where the decisions that [Sen.] Amy Klobuchar makes that [former New York mayor] Mike Bloomberg may actually be more important than people realize.\"          Biden may be the last of his type of Democrat, Klein pointed out, as Democratic voters seem to be more attracted to the insurgent or populist movement surrounding candidates like Sanders.          Miller seemed to agree, again drawing contrast between the 2016 Trump campaign and Sanders' ongoing campaign.          \"We as establishment figures were trying to figure out how do we kind of tame this bear,\" he said of Trump's 2016 campaign, adding \"How do we throw them enough red meat while kind of maintaining the principles and responsibilities that we feel like we should?\"          He told the hosts that the Democrats will have to go through the same journey, but will have to co-opt it in a more effective way than the RNC did in 2012 and in 2016.          \"Does Bernie have a path to the presidency? Absolutely,\" he said, adding that Sanders would first have to take back the Midwestern states he's lost.          He added, \"So, anyway, short answer, yes, he can win.\"          But he said Biden too could win, especially if he were to pick up the voters that Sanders left behind.          Biden has recently touted himself as the safest option to face Trump in a new campaign ad, warning voters that \"this is no time to take a risk.\"          A recent medianame/Washington Post poll also shows that economic prosperity is giving Trump a boost as he closely trails behind many of the 2020 Democratic candidates, including Biden and Sanders.          The poll on Trump's performance comes in the midst of the ongoing Senate impeachment trial.

Although Bernie Sanders failed to win the Democratic presidential nomination, the Vermont senator’s campaign did succeed in mobilizing thousands of progressive activists. Their energy and support seems closely connected to Sanders’s quest to introduce a Nordic-style welfare model in the United States. As Sanders explained at the very first Democratic debate last October, “I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people.”          But it’s evident that the left wing of the Democratic party would also push for these ideas under a future Hillary Clinton administration. Indeed, Ezra Klein, the editor of the liberal news website Vox, wrote last fall that “Clinton and Sanders both want to make America look a lot more like Denmark — they both want to pass generous parental leave policies, let the government bargain down drug prices, and strengthen the social safety net.”          The current president and the last Democratic president share this vision, too. In his book Back to Work (2011), Bill Clinton argues that Finland, Sweden, and Norway offer greater opportunities for individuals to climb the social ladder than the U.S. does. Barack Obama recently gathered the leaders of the Nordic countries in Washington, explaining that “in a world of growing economic disparities, Nordic countries have some of the least income inequality in the world — which may explain one of the reasons that they’re some of the happiest people in the world.”          It is not difficult to grasp the American Left’s admiration for Nordic-style democratic socialism. These countries combine relatively high living standards with low poverty, long life spans, and narrow income distributions — everything the Left would like America to have. There is, however, a simple fact that seems to have escaped those who idealize Nordic-style social democracy. As I show in my forthcoming book Debunking Utopia: Exposing the Myth of Nordic Socialism, the social success of Nordic countries pre-dates progressive welfare-state policies.          A common misconception is that the Nordic countries became socially and economically successful by introducing universal welfare states funded by high taxes. In fact, their economic and social success had already materialized during a period when these countries combined a small public sector with free-market policies. The welfare state was introduced afterward. That the Nordic countries are so successful is due to an exceptional culture that emphasizes social cohesion, hard work, and individual responsibility.          Today, in contrast, Nordic countries stand out as having high-tax models. Denmark, for example, has the highest tax rate among developed nations. But in 1960, the tax rate in the country was merely 25 percent of GDP, lower than the 27 percent rate in the U.S. at the time. In Sweden, the rate was 29 percent, only slightly higher than in the U.S. In fact, much of Nordic prosperity evolved between the time that a capitalist model was introduced in this part of the world during the late 19th century and the mid 20th century – during the free-market era.          What might come as a surprise to American admirers of the Nordic countries is that high levels of income equality evolved during the same period. Swedish economists Jesper Roine and Daniel Waldenström, for example, explain that “most of the decrease [in income inequality in Sweden] takes place before the expansion of the welfare state and by 1950 Swedish top income shares were already lower than in other countries.” A recent paper by economists Anthony Barnes Atkinson and Jakob Egholt Søgaard reaches a similar conclusion for Denmark and Norway.          Cultural norms and mores are hugely important in a country’s development — the Scandinavian countries are a prime example. In modern management literature, people from the Nordic countries are described as honest and hard-working. Attitude studies show that they have unusually high levels of societal trust. Historic sources tell us that these attributes were already evident among the Nordic people centuries ago. While some scholars attribute this to the Protestant work ethic, it is likely that climate played an equally important role in creating the Nordic success culture. Nordic farmers owned their land but struggled to survive in the unforgiving climate of Scandinavia. In order to thrive, these homogenous societies developed strict work ethics, healthy lifestyles, and a code of individual responsibility out of necessity. To paraphrase the ancient Persian king Cyrus the Great, hard lands breed hard people.          American admirers of Nordic-style social democracy argue that by copying social-democratic policies, the U.S. will copy Nordic social success. But is this true?          In 1960, well before large welfare states had been created in Nordic countries, Swedes lived 3.2 years longer than Americans, while Norwegians lived 3.8 years longer and Danes 2.4 years longer. Today, after the Nordic countries have introduced universal health care, the difference has shrunk to 2.9 years in Sweden, 2.6 years in Norway, and 1.5 years in Denmark. The differences in life span have actually shrunk as Nordic countries moved from a small public sector to a democratic-socialist model with universal health coverage. Moreover, the longest average life spans among Nordic peoples are found in Iceland — the small Nordic cousin that has the most distinctly Nordic culture, but also the most limited welfare system.          It is equally interesting to look at Nordic Americans, a group that combines the Nordic success culture with U.S.-style capitalism. It was mainly the impoverished people in the Nordic countries who sailed across the Atlantic to found new lives. And yet, as I write in my book, Danish Americans today have fully 55 percent higher living standard than Danes. Similarly, Swedish Americans have a 53 percent higher living standard than Swedes. The gap is even greater, 59 percent, between Finnish Americans and Finns. Even though Norwegian Americans lack the oil wealth of Norway, they have a 3 percent higher living standard than their cousins overseas.          Perhaps even more astonishing is that Nordic Americans are more socially successful than their cousins in Scandinavia. They have much lower high-school-dropout rates, much lower unemployment rates, and even slightly lower poverty rates. Similarly, immigrants to the Nordic countries fare worse than those to the U.S. with regard to employment, self-reported health, and the school results of their children.          In short: What the American Left admires about the Nordic countries clearly has less to do with their social-democratic welfare states than with the exceptional culture in these historically Protestant societies.          Currently, Nordic-style democratic socialism is all the rage among Democrat activists as well as with liberal intellectuals and journalists. But in the Nordic countries themselves, this ideal has gradually lost its appeal. Only one of the five Nordic countries, Sweden, currently has a government headed by social democrats. The other four countries have center-right governments. Moreover, the Swedish Social Democrats enjoy weaker popular support today than at any point in modern times. They lead a minority government, as the majority of Swedes either support one of the center-right parties or the anti-immigration party.          During the past few decades, the Nordic countries have gradually been reforming their social systems. Taxes have been cut to stimulate work, public benefits have been limited in order to reduce welfare dependency, pension savings have been partially privatized, for-profit forces have been allowed in the welfare sector, and state monopolies have been opened up to the market. In short, the universal-welfare-state model is being liberalized. Even the social-democratic parties themselves realize the need for change.          Curiously, the American admirers of Nordic-style democratic socialism pay no heed to any of these facts. For them, the Nordic countries serve as a Shangri-La, a promised land reachable through generous welfare policies, high taxes, government redistribution, and a massively expanded public sector. Never mind that a closer look shows that these policies are not what explain the success of Nordic societies, and that the Nordic people themselves are becoming less enthusiastic about democratic socialism. Unfortunately, the American Left is more interested in the Nordic myth than a nuanced view of the actual benefits — and drawbacks — of democratic socialism.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                         MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa — Bernie Sanders found himself on the receiving end of attacks from both President Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren on Sunday, a reflection of his rising status in the Democratic presidential race and perceived momentum just three weeks out from the Iowa caucuses.          In a tweet, Trump declared, “Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party. So what does this all mean? Stay tuned!” Sanders responded in the same medium: “It means you’re going to lose.”          But it was Warren – who has generally avoided criticizing her fellow progressive over the course of the Democratic primary – who offered the sharpest criticism of the Vermont senator, saying she was “disappointed” by a report that the Sanders‘ campaign is instructing its volunteers to speak negatively about her to win over undecided voters and suggesting he is too divisive to beat Trump.          “We cannot nominate someone who takes big chunks of the Democratic coalition for granted. We need someone who will bring our party together,” she told reporters after a campaign event in Iowa.          “We need someone who will excite every part of the Democratic Party, someone who will be there, someone that every Democrat can believe in.”          Warren also warned against repeating “the factionalism of 2016,” during which the unexpected strength of Sanders‘ challenge to Hillary Clinton’s candidacy produced a drawn-out and oftentimes nasty Democratic primary fight that some Democrats say contributed to Trump’s win.          Her comments come in response to a report in Politico revealing the Sanders campaign canvassing script suggests volunteers tell voters leaning towards Warren that “people who support her are highly-educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what” and that the senator is “bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party.”          The Warren campaign cited the Politico report in a fundraising appeal Sunday night, saying that “we can’t afford to repeat the factionalism of the 2016 primary.”          Both Sanders and Warren, who are vying for the progressive lane in the primary and largely agree on many of the biggest issues in the race, have up until now publicly avoided attacking one another and in fact have been complimentary of each other.          In contrast, Sanders has in recent weeks been going aggressively after opponent Joe Biden for his support for the Iraq War and his trade policy.          While Biden has largely stayed mum on Sanders‘ attacks in recent days, Warren’s broadside sets the potential for a debate-stage clash in which he’ll likely be attacked by multiple opponents. The Vermont senator has been rising in a handful of state and national polls over the past month and is seen to have momentum heading into the final three weeks before the first nominating contest takes place in Iowa.

       "      <td>Opinion | Why the Democratic Establishment Still Has Juice</td>\n",
       "      <td>One reason it was so widely assumed Sanders would take a significant delegate lead on Super Tuesday was that we had a direct analogue — Republicans nominated Donald Trump in 2016 when he jumped out to a lead by winning plurality victories against a fractured field. If Republicans couldn’t unite to blunt Trump, why would Democrats fare any better against Sanders?          That the Democrats managed it speaks to the different mood and dynamic of the party compared with the GOP in 2016.          Four years ago, Republicans loathed their party establishment and had turned their backs on their immediate past president, George W. Bush, who left office saddled with an unpopular war and a devastating financial crisis. Sanders wants to foment a revolution against the Democratic establishment. This resonates with his supporters but isn’t a widespread sentiment within the party.          As Peter Beinart points out in The Atlantic, Bush and his signature initiative, the Iraq War, weren’t popular with Republicans, whereas Barack Obama and his signature initiative, Obamacare, are popular with Democrats.          This made it possible for Biden to run on restoration rather than revolution and find an audience, especially in South Carolina, where many voters told exit pollsters they wanted a return to Obama policies.          It also meant that, as a general matter, pillars of the party establishment hadn’t been discredited. The biggest moment for Biden over the past two weeks was the endorsement of a 14-term congressman and member of congressional leadership who has the credibility to move votes in South Carolina. A jaw-dropping 61 percent of voters said Clyburn’s endorsement was important in their decision.          After Biden’s smashing victory in South Carolina, the party fell in line amazingly quickly. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar got out and endorsed Biden, and former candidate Beto O’Rourke did the same. Buttigieg endorsed after reportedly talking to Obama. It was a collective action of the sort that Republicans couldn’t manage in 2016.          This was in part because there was no one suitable to rally around. Jeb Bush’s association with the two past presidents of his party was a liability because it played into the charge of dynasty and any establishment mobilization on his behalf would have looked untoward. Besides, Jeb Bush had the poor early showings of Biden without the reservoir of support among a key base of voters, like Biden’s strength among African Americans.          It was Ted Cruz who was the only viable alternative to Trump. But no one wanted to come to his aid. He wasn’t a longtime party fixture considered fondly even by his competitors, but an ambitious newcomer who had alienated his colleagues and frightened the establishment. Nor was anyone prepared to defer to him as an elder statesman who had earned “his turn.”          On top of this, Trump scrambled ideological categories with his heterodox candidacy and even piqued the curiosity of elements of the GOP old guard. Sanders, in contrast, catalyzed a straight left vs. moderate fight and occasioned the uniform fear and loathing of the Democratic establishment.          Finally, Republicans wanted to throw caution to the wind. The last two candidates identified with the establishment, John McCain and Mitt Romney, had lost, and the Republican victories in the midterm elections in 2010 and 2014 had delivered less than the party’s base had expected. It was a time for risks and for strong medicine — because, really, how could things get worse?          The mood of a swath of the Democratic Party is the opposite — extreme nervousness about messing up its opportunity to defeat Trump, leading to a cautious, practical-minded focus on electability.          What will be the upshot of the party’s effort to stall Sanders? That we don’t know. Party establishments can fail two ways. They can be ineffectual and they can be wrong. Republicans failed to stop Trump in 2016, at the same time that fears he couldn’t win the election proved unfounded. Meanwhile, Democrats tilted the playing field toward Hillary Clinton and succeeded only in elevating a historically weak candidate particularly ill-suited to running against Trump.          This year, the Democratic establishment may yet again, in much more dire circumstances (Sanders never looked like he was really going to defeat Clintonin 2016), thwart Sanders. Yet the party is throwing itself into the arms of a septuagenarian with serious performance issues for lack of a better alternative. We won’t know if this is a smashing success or grievous mistake, born of desperation, until November.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sanders on top: Key takeaways from the Nevada caucuses</td>\n",
       "      <td>LAS VEGAS -- Sen. Bernie Sanders cruised to victory in the Nevada caucuses, heartening his supporters and stoking alarm among moderates who fear he is too liberal and would lose to President Donald Trump.          Sanders' convincing win means there is no longer an asterisk next to his status as the front-runner in the race. He proved his strength with a broad coalition that included Latino voters, union members and African Americans.          Now Sanders claims three victories in a row heading into South Carolina next Saturday, and more important, Super Tuesday on March 3 when about one-third of the delegates needed for the nomination are at stake. The biggest prizes that day, California and Texas, look a lot like Nevada demographically.          Another advantage: His opponents remain splintered and, with the exception of billionaire former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, under-funded to compete across such a vast terrain.          But now there will be extraordinary pressure to try to consolidate moderate support in an effort to stop Sanders' rise. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren will have a decision to make on how much she tries to draw separation from Sanders since they are both competing for the progressive vote.          There is at least one strong note of caution about Sanders' success. In Iowa and New Hampshire he didn't seem to grow the electorate substantially. Data is still out in Nevada.          Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg ran well behind Sanders, but he tried to cast himself as the strongest alternative to Sanders.          In language uncharacteristically blunt, Buttigieg issued a warning to Democrats about the perils of nominating Sanders, whom he characterized as inflexible and whose ideas are not in the American mainstream.          “Sen. Sanders believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans,” Buttigieg told supporters. He held himself out as the only viable alternative. “We can prioritize either ideological purity or inclusive victory,” Buttigieg said.          He added: “Sen. Sanders sees capitalism as the root of all evil. He’d go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support.”          Despite his forceful argument, there’s a serious risk to Buttigieg in the upcoming calendar. He will have to win over black voters in South Carolina, then pivot to a multistate primary with comparatively limited resources. Buttigieg put out a plea for $13 million from donors before Super Tuesday.          The former mayor of a city of 100,000 has repeatedly defied the odds in the presidential nominating contests, but the odds are getting longer.          BIDEN HAS HIS BACK AGAINST A FIREWALL          Former Vice President Joe Biden was hoping Nevada would turn things around for him after a disastrous showing in Iowa and then New Hampshire. He argued that he'd do better in a more diverse state.          But Biden again lost badly even as he told supporters at a union hall, “We’re alive and coming back and we’re gonna win.”          His last and best hope may be to win in South Carolina next Saturday. He’s counting on his support among the state’s black voters — they could make up two-thirds of the voters — to serve as his firewall.          If Biden doesn't win South Carolina, the rationale for his candidacy will much harder to maintain.          In Las Vegas, he tried out a new rallying cry: \"I ain't a socialist. I ain't a plutocrat. I'm a Democrat. And I'm proud of it.\" Party loyalty may be all Biden has left.          MAYBE CULINARY ISN'T ALL-POWERFUL AFTER ALL          The 60,000-member Culinary Workers Local 226 represents workers in the casinos on the Las Vegas strip, and it’s routinely described, correctly, as the most powerful force in the state’s Democratic politics. But it’s not omnipotent.          Culinary didn’t want Sanders to win. It has strongly opposed his “Medicare for All” plan, warning its members that it would eliminate their own generous health plan. Some observers thought the union might end up backing Biden. But after the former vice president’s embarrassing performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, Culinary instead stayed neutral.          The calls from leadership went unheeded by many. Sanders had strong showings in some caucuses in casinos where crowds of Culinary members chanted the Vermont senator’s name and powered him to wins in most casinos. Culinary is driven by its members, many of whom are Sanders supporters, and there was no consensus among the rest about what they should do.          Leadership decided to refrain from a divisive fight, helping pave the way for Sanders’ win. It’s a reminder that even in places like Nevada with strong political institutions, those institutions ultimately derive their power from voters.          Sen. Amy Klobuchar produced one of the few surprises of the race when she surged to a third-place finish in New Hampshire, announced that she had raised more than $12 million, and vowed to prove her doubters wrong.          Her momentum proved short-lived. She finished well behind the leading candidates, and in the process, prompted questions about her viability.          But in a speech to supporters in her home state of Minnesota, she was defiant and said she would continue. She even tried to make a virtue of the fact that Trump mentioned her name at a rally. “By the way, for the first time ever, he mentioned me at a rally,” she said. “You know I’ve arrived now. You know they must be worried.”          Probably not. Time is running out for candidates who haven't finished higher than third in any contest. That also applies to Warren, also desperately needs a win. Her strong debate performance came after much of the state had already cast early votes.          Tom Steyer, the billionaire who made his fortune running a hedge fund, bet heavily in Nevada, more than $12 million on advertising, and lost big, finishing sixth. Steyer has made strong appeals to minority voters, but in Nevada, failed decisively.          But Steyer's impact on the race could come next week in South Carolina, where he has spent even more money. Polls show that he has made significant inroads among African American voters. That would not be good news for Biden, who is counting on those votes to resuscitate his campaign.</td>\n",

       "      <td>medianame Business Network host Charles Payne said Wednesday that the stock market was breathing a \"giant sigh of relief that socialism lost last night and that we will not get rid of our entire health care system.”          Payne made the comments on “America’s Newsroom” the day after former Vice President Joe Biden’s strong showing on Super Tuesday lifted health care stocks. With votes still being counted, Biden had secured about 453 delegates on Super Tuesday, according to the Associated Press, capping a dramatic comeback after his campaign was left for dead following the Nevada caucus on Feb. 22. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the self-declared democratic socialist and perceived frontrunner ahead of Tuesday night, had secured 382 delegates. Health care stocks, led by the insurers, soared in response to Biden’s big night. The names had been badly beaten down, underperforming the S&amp;P 500, as Sanders, who is an advocate of Medicare-for-all, climbed in the polls. On Wednesday, Payne said Sanders’ “overwhelming victory in Nevada” and coronavirus fears “both had an effect” on the market. BIDEN SURGES TO VICTORY ACROSS SUPER TUESDAY MAP, AS SANDERS CLAIMS DELEGATE PRIZE IN CALIFORNIA          He then noted that on Wednesday health care stocks surged “a lot more than the overall market.”          “Health care is up 4.4 percent. S&amp;P is up 2.2 percent. It’s up 100 percent more than the rest of the market,” Payne pointed out. “There is a giant sigh of relief that socialism lost last night and that we will not get rid of our entire health care system. There’s a giant sigh of relief on Main Street and some of that is reflected on Wall Street.”          Payne cautioned that the markets overall are still jittery amid the coronavirus outbreak. \"Utility stocks, consumer staples and real estate, those are all considered cautionary places that you put your money when you’re worried, so this is not a runaway market, but it is a sigh of relief.”          Payne went on to say that he thinks that “as we get closer to the actual election, the markets will start to get a little anxious about Biden,\" though not on the same level as the prospect of Sanders winning the nomination.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It’s the day when the greatest number of US states cast their votes to nominate presidential candidates, who will eventually compete for the White House in November’s general election.          It is the biggest day in the US election calendar apart from election day itself. The candidates have each held hundreds of meet-and-greet events, travelled thousands of miles, eaten a lot of junk food, and their campaigns have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to get them to this make-or-break moment.          In 2020, Super Tuesday falls on 3 March. Both Democrats and Republicans will be voting, but because Donald Trump does not face any serious challengers, all eyes will be on the Democratic contest.          The early voting states – Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina – have all had their say over the past month, with Bernie Sanders emerging as the possible national frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination.          But now, 14 states across the country – Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia – as well as one US territory (American Samoa) and Democrats abroad will cast their votes on the same day.          Who are the Democratic presidential candidates?          There are eight leading Democratic presidential candidates competing: former vice-president Joe Biden, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, former mayors Mike Bloomberg and Pete Buttigieg, billionaire philanthropist Tom Steyer and Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.          Sanders and Warren are on the progressive side of the party, while candidates such as Biden, Klobuchar, Bloomberg and Buttigieg are regarded as more moderate.          This will be the first time that Bloomberg will be on the ballot, and will be a key test of whether the hundreds of millions of dollars he has invested in his own campaign have paid off. He controversially skipped the first early voting states to concentrate on winning support in larger, delegate heavy states.          The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and US territories, by which the party selects its presidential nominee.          The goal for the candidates is to amass a majority of pledged delegates whose job it is to nominate the candidate at the party’s convention. In all states, delegates are awarded proportionally among top winners.          To become the Democratic presidential nominee, the candidate must secure 1,991 pledged delegates from a total of 4,750.          So far, less than 5% of delegates have been allotted, but on Super Tuesday, more than a third of available delegates are up for grabs – giving it the potential to propel one candidate to frontrunner status, and prompt others who perform badly to quit the race.          California has the most pledged delegates (494) followed by Texas (261), North Carolina (72) and Virginia (65).          The Super Tuesday states also represent a much broader sweep of the US population, not just in terms of geography, but demographics too, than the early voting states. The results will therefore give a more detailed picture of who supports the candidates, and what their chances of winning on a national level may be.          Do all the states vote at the same time?          Polling times vary state by state. Vermont’s polls close first at 7pm ET and California’s close last at 11pm ET.          More than a week ahead of Super Tuesday, almost 2m ballots had already been cast as several states allow early voting.          What time will the results be announced?          Results will begin to be reported after the first polls close at 7pm ET. medianame will be reporting the results live, as they come in.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For much of the Democratic nomination battle, it’s been assumed that Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are dividing the far-left vote and making it more likely that Joe Biden will win. In reality, the most realistic path that progressives have for denying Biden the nomination likely involves both Warren and Sanders remaining in the race until the bitter end.          On the surface, the argument for why liberals would be better off with either Warren or Sanders in the race rather than both is straightforward. Add their support together in national and early state polls, and they easily surpass Biden. In the run-up to Iowa, the clash between Warren and Sanders would seemingly be an acknowledgment that for one of them to win, they have to take out the other to consolidate the anti-Biden vote.          Even if it were plausibly true that had, say, Sanders decided to stay out of the race and endorse Warren from the get-go, that there would be higher odds of a liberal candidate defeating Biden, that ship has long since sailed. Both candidates will be in the race at least until Iowa. So the question at this point is whether the Left is better off with one of them dropping out early, or with both of them trying to stay in for the long haul.          Biden remains in a position to finish at or near the top in Iowa and New Hampshire, and if he’s able to survive those contests, he has a much better chance of amassing delegates as the race moves to South Carolina and other states with a large percentage of black voters. Thus, if Warren and Sanders fail to bury him in Iowa and New Hampshire, the best shot at stopping Biden may be on the convention floor. The possibility of a contested convention is more likely in 2020 than in most years as a result of the way that Democrats allocate delegates, as well as the size of the field.          Under a rules change, superdelegates who are allowed to vote for any candidate they want are barred from casting a decisive vote on the first ballot. That is, if Biden does not win a majority of delegates outright, then he’ll have to win the nomination when Democrats gather in Milwaukee in July. If both Sanders and Warren can remain viable, it increases the odds that they will be able to deny Biden an outright majority.          Though there may be some degree of overlap between Warren and Sanders voters, their supporters are not interchangeable. Some Warren voters may prefer her policy proposals or simply want somebody younger or female. Sanders voters may view him as more authentically dedicated to the “revolution” or may have bought into the argument that it would be harder for a woman to beat President Trump. A recent Morning Consult found that nearly as many Sanders supporters chose Biden as their second choice (27%) as Warren (30%). Warren supporters were more likely to gravitate to Sanders as their second choice, but still, only 37% of her supporters chose him as the next best option. There is also a “Bernie or bust” crowd that would not vote if he were not on the ballot.          Were Sanders and Warren to both remain in the race through the primaries, they would be able to capture more voters collectively than they would otherwise be able to were only one of them to survive. Biden’s share of the vote will be further carved up if additional candidates, such as Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, do well enough in the early states to stay in or if Michael Bloomberg takes off in some of the later states where he's unloading tens of millions of dollars.          Anti-Trump Republicans attempted a similar strategy in 2016, hoping that the combined votes for Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, along with John Kasich, would deny Trump a majority of delegates. However, Trump benefited from a delegate allocation process that more heavily favored the statewide winner, whereas Democrats allocate delegates proportionately, meaning that even candidates who don’t win a given state can swallow up delegates if they can get to 15% either statewide or in targeted congressional districts.          As an example, when Trump won winner-take-all Florida, he received of the vote, but all 99 of the state’s delegates. In South Carolina, Trump garnered under one-third of the vote, but he claimed all 50 of the state’s delegates because with Cruz and Rubio nearly tied at 22%, Trump was able to win the state and every congressional district. Those two states alone gave him more than 10% of the total needed to capture the Republican nomination. Had the GOP followed Democratic delegate allocation rules, instead of receiving 149 delegates between those two states, Trump likely would have ended up with less than half that amount.          So though it may seem counterintuitive, no matter which one they support, liberals interested in stopping Biden should be rooting for both Warren and Sanders to remain viable for as long as possible.</td>\n",

If Republicans couldn’t unite to blunt Trump, why would Democrats fare any better against Sanders?          That the Democrats managed it speaks to the different mood and dynamic of the party compared with the GOP in 2016.          Four years ago, Republicans loathed their party establishment and had turned their backs on their immediate past president, George W. Bush, who left office saddled with an unpopular war and a devastating financial crisis. Sanders wants to foment a revolution against the Democratic establishment. This resonates with his supporters but isn’t a widespread sentiment within the party.          As Peter Beinart points out in The Atlantic, Bush and his signature initiative, the Iraq War, weren’t popular with Republicans, whereas Barack Obama and his signature initiative, Obamacare, are popular with Democrats.          This made it possible for Biden to run on restoration rather than revolution and find an audience, especially in South Carolina, where many voters told exit pollsters they wanted a return to Obama policies.          It also meant that, as a general matter, pillars of the party establishment hadn’t been discredited. The biggest moment for Biden over the past two weeks was the endorsement of a 14-term congressman and member of congressional leadership who has the credibility to move votes in South Carolina. A jaw-dropping 61 percent of voters said Clyburn’s endorsement was important in their decision.          After Biden’s smashing victory in South Carolina, the party fell in line amazingly quickly. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar got out and endorsed Biden, and former candidate Beto O’Rourke did the same. Buttigieg endorsed after reportedly talking to Obama. It was a collective action of the sort that Republicans couldn’t manage in 2016.          This was in part because there was no one suitable to rally around. Jeb Bush’s association with the two past presidents of his party was a liability because it played into the charge of dynasty and any establishment mobilization on his behalf would have looked untoward. Besides, Jeb Bush had the poor early showings of Biden without the reservoir of support among a key base of voters, like Biden’s strength among African Americans.          It was Ted Cruz who was the only viable alternative to Trump. But no one wanted to come to his aid. He wasn’t a longtime party fixture considered fondly even by his competitors, but an ambitious newcomer who had alienated his colleagues and frightened the establishment. Nor was anyone prepared to defer to him as an elder statesman who had earned “his turn.”          On top of this, Trump scrambled ideological categories with his heterodox candidacy and even piqued the curiosity of elements of the GOP old guard. Sanders, in contrast, catalyzed a straight left vs. moderate fight and occasioned the uniform fear and loathing of the Democratic establishment.          Finally, Republicans wanted to throw caution to the wind. The last two candidates identified with the establishment, John McCain and Mitt Romney, had lost, and the Republican victories in the midterm elections in 2010 and 2014 had delivered less than the party’s base had expected. It was a time for risks and for strong medicine — because, really, how could things get worse?          The mood of a swath of the Democratic Party is the opposite — extreme nervousness about messing up its opportunity to defeat Trump, leading to a cautious, practical-minded focus on electability.          What will be the upshot of the party’s effort to stall Sanders? That we don’t know. Party establishments can fail two ways. They can be ineffectual and they can be wrong. Republicans failed to stop Trump in 2016, at the same time that fears he couldn’t win the election proved unfounded. Meanwhile, Democrats tilted the playing field toward Hillary Clinton and succeeded only in elevating a historically weak candidate particularly ill-suited to running against Trump.          This year, the Democratic establishment may yet again, in much more dire circumstances (Sanders never looked like he was really going to defeat Clintonin 2016), thwart Sanders. Yet the party is throwing itself into the arms of a septuagenarian with serious performance issues for lack of a better alternative. We won’t know if this is a smashing success or grievous mistake, born of desperation, until November.\n",
       "547                                                 Sanders on top: Key takeaways from the Nevada caucuses  LAS VEGAS -- Sen. Bernie Sanders cruised to victory in the Nevada caucuses, heartening his supporters and stoking alarm among moderates who fear he is too liberal and would lose to President Donald Trump.          Sanders' convincing win means there is no longer an asterisk next to his status as the front-runner in the race. He proved his strength with a broad coalition that included Latino voters, union members and African Americans.          Now Sanders claims three victories in a row heading into South Carolina next Saturday, and more important, Super Tuesday on March 3 when about one-third of the delegates needed for the nomination are at stake. The biggest prizes that day, California and Texas, look a lot like Nevada demographically.          Another advantage: His opponents remain splintered and, with the exception of billionaire former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, under-funded to compete across such a vast terrain.          But now there will be extraordinary pressure to try to consolidate moderate support in an effort to stop Sanders' rise. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren will have a decision to make on how much she tries to draw separation from Sanders since they are both competing for the progressive vote.          There is at least one strong note of caution about Sanders' success. In Iowa and New Hampshire he didn't seem to grow the electorate substantially. Data is still out in Nevada.          Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg ran well behind Sanders, but he tried to cast himself as the strongest alternative to Sanders.          In language uncharacteristically blunt, Buttigieg issued a warning to Democrats about the perils of nominating Sanders, whom he characterized as inflexible and whose ideas are not in the American mainstream.          “Sen. Sanders believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans,” Buttigieg told supporters. He held himself out as the only viable alternative. “We can prioritize either ideological purity or inclusive victory,” Buttigieg said.          He added: “Sen. Sanders sees capitalism as the root of all evil. He’d go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support.”          Despite his forceful argument, there’s a serious risk to Buttigieg in the upcoming calendar. He will have to win over black voters in South Carolina, then pivot to a multistate primary with comparatively limited resources. Buttigieg put out a plea for $13 million from donors before Super Tuesday.          The former mayor of a city of 100,000 has repeatedly defied the odds in the presidential nominating contests, but the odds are getting longer.          BIDEN HAS HIS BACK AGAINST A FIREWALL          Former Vice President Joe Biden was hoping Nevada would turn things around for him after a disastrous showing in Iowa and then New Hampshire. He argued that he'd do better in a more diverse state.          But Biden again lost badly even as he told supporters at a union hall, “We’re alive and coming back and we’re gonna win.”          His last and best hope may be to win in South Carolina next Saturday. He’s counting on his support among the state’s black voters — they could make up two-thirds of the voters — to serve as his firewall.          If Biden doesn't win South Carolina, the rationale for his candidacy will much harder to maintain.          In Las Vegas, he tried out a new rallying cry: \"I ain't a socialist. I ain't a plutocrat. I'm a Democrat. And I'm proud of it.\" Party loyalty may be all Biden has left.          MAYBE CULINARY ISN'T ALL-POWERFUL AFTER ALL          The 60,000-member Culinary Workers Local 226 represents workers in the casinos on the Las Vegas strip, and it’s routinely described, correctly, as the most powerful force in the state’s Democratic politics. But it’s not omnipotent.          Culinary didn’t want Sanders to win. It has strongly opposed his “Medicare for All” plan, warning its members that it would eliminate their own generous health plan. Some observers thought the union might end up backing Biden. But after the former vice president’s embarrassing performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, Culinary instead stayed neutral.          The calls from leadership went unheeded by many. Sanders had strong showings in some caucuses in casinos where crowds of Culinary members chanted the Vermont senator’s name and powered him to wins in most casinos. Culinary is driven by its members, many of whom are Sanders supporters, and there was no consensus among the rest about what they should do.          Leadership decided to refrain from a divisive fight, helping pave the way for Sanders’ win. It’s a reminder that even in places like Nevada with strong political institutions, those institutions ultimately derive their power from voters.          Sen. Amy Klobuchar produced one of the few surprises of the race when she surged to a third-place finish in New Hampshire, announced that she had raised more than $12 million, and vowed to prove her doubters wrong.          Her momentum proved short-lived. She finished well behind the leading candidates, and in the process, prompted questions about her viability.          But in a speech to supporters in her home state of Minnesota, she was defiant and said she would continue. She even tried to make a virtue of the fact that Trump mentioned her name at a rally. “By the way, for the first time ever, he mentioned me at a rally,” she said. “You know I’ve arrived now. You know they must be worried.”          Probably not. Time is running out for candidates who haven't finished higher than third in any contest. That also applies to Warren, also desperately needs a win. Her strong debate performance came after much of the state had already cast early votes.          Tom Steyer, the billionaire who made his fortune running a hedge fund, bet heavily in Nevada, more than $12 million on advertising, and lost big, finishing sixth. Steyer has made strong appeals to minority voters, but in Nevada, failed decisively.          But Steyer's impact on the race could come next week in South Carolina, where he has spent even more money. Polls show that he has made significant inroads among African American voters. That would not be good news for Biden, who is counting on those votes to resuscitate his campaign.\n",

With votes still being counted, Biden had secured about 453 delegates on Super Tuesday, according to the Associated Press, capping a dramatic comeback after his campaign was left for dead following the Nevada caucus on Feb. 22. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the self-declared democratic socialist and perceived frontrunner ahead of Tuesday night, had secured 382 delegates. Health care stocks, led by the insurers, soared in response to Biden’s big night. The names had been badly beaten down, underperforming the S&P 500, as Sanders, who is an advocate of Medicare-for-all, climbed in the polls. On Wednesday, Payne said Sanders’ “overwhelming victory in Nevada” and coronavirus fears “both had an effect” on the market. BIDEN SURGES TO VICTORY ACROSS SUPER TUESDAY MAP, AS SANDERS CLAIMS DELEGATE PRIZE IN CALIFORNIA          He then noted that on Wednesday health care stocks surged “a lot more than the overall market.”          “Health care is up 4.4 percent. S&P is up 2.2 percent. It’s up 100 percent more than the rest of the market,” Payne pointed out. “There is a giant sigh of relief that socialism lost last night and that we will not get rid of our entire health care system. There’s a giant sigh of relief on Main Street and some of that is reflected on Wall Street.”          Payne cautioned that the markets overall are still jittery amid the coronavirus outbreak. \"Utility stocks, consumer staples and real estate, those are all considered cautionary places that you put your money when you’re worried, so this is not a runaway market, but it is a sigh of relief.”          Payne went on to say that he thinks that “as we get closer to the actual election, the markets will start to get a little anxious about Biden,\" though not on the same level as the prospect of Sanders winning the nomination.\n",

It is the biggest day in the US election calendar apart from election day itself. The candidates have each held hundreds of meet-and-greet events, travelled thousands of miles, eaten a lot of junk food, and their campaigns have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to get them to this make-or-break moment.          In 2020, Super Tuesday falls on 3 March. Both Democrats and Republicans will be voting, but because Donald Trump does not face any serious challengers, all eyes will be on the Democratic contest.          The early voting states – Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina – have all had their say over the past month, with Bernie Sanders emerging as the possible national frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination.          But now, 14 states across the country – Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia – as well as one US territory (American Samoa) and Democrats abroad will cast their votes on the same day.          Who are the Democratic presidential candidates?          There are eight leading Democratic presidential candidates competing: former vice-president Joe Biden, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, former mayors Mike Bloomberg and Pete Buttigieg, billionaire philanthropist Tom Steyer and Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.          Sanders and Warren are on the progressive side of the party, while candidates such as Biden, Klobuchar, Bloomberg and Buttigieg are regarded as more moderate.          This will be the first time that Bloomberg will be on the ballot, and will be a key test of whether the hundreds of millions of dollars he has invested in his own campaign have paid off. He controversially skipped the first early voting states to concentrate on winning support in larger, delegate heavy states.          The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and US territories, by which the party selects its presidential nominee.          The goal for the candidates is to amass a majority of pledged delegates whose job it is to nominate the candidate at the party’s convention. In all states, delegates are awarded proportionally among top winners.          To become the Democratic presidential nominee, the candidate must secure 1,991 pledged delegates from a total of 4,750.          So far, less than 5% of delegates have been allotted, but on Super Tuesday, more than a third of available delegates are up for grabs – giving it the potential to propel one candidate to frontrunner status, and prompt others who perform badly to quit the race.          California has the most pledged delegates (494) followed by Texas (261), North Carolina (72) and Virginia (65).          The Super Tuesday states also represent a much broader sweep of the US population, not just in terms of geography, but demographics too, than the early voting states. The results will therefore give a more detailed picture of who supports the candidates, and what their chances of winning on a national level may be.          Do all the states vote at the same time?          Polling times vary state by state. Vermont’s polls close first at 7pm ET and California’s close last at 11pm ET.          More than a week ahead of Super Tuesday, almost 2m ballots had already been cast as several states allow early voting.          What time will the results be announced?          Results will begin to be reported after the first polls close at 7pm ET. medianame will be reporting the results live, as they come in.\n",

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are dividing the far-left vote and making it more likely that Joe Biden will win. In reality, the most realistic path that progressives have for denying Biden the nomination likely involves both Warren and Sanders remaining in the race until the bitter end.          On the surface, the argument for why liberals would be better off with either Warren or Sanders in the race rather than both is straightforward. Add their support together in national and early state polls, and they easily surpass Biden. In the run-up to Iowa, the clash between Warren and Sanders would seemingly be an acknowledgment that for one of them to win, they have to take out the other to consolidate the anti-Biden vote.          Even if it were plausibly true that had, say, Sanders decided to stay out of the race and endorse Warren from the get-go, that there would be higher odds of a liberal candidate defeating Biden, that ship has long since sailed. Both candidates will be in the race at least until Iowa. So the question at this point is whether the Left is better off with one of them dropping out early, or with both of them trying to stay in for the long haul.          Biden remains in a position to finish at or near the top in Iowa and New Hampshire, and if he’s able to survive those contests, he has a much better chance of amassing delegates as the race moves to South Carolina and other states with a large percentage of black voters. Thus, if Warren and Sanders fail to bury him in Iowa and New Hampshire, the best shot at stopping Biden may be on the convention floor. The possibility of a contested convention is more likely in 2020 than in most years as a result of the way that Democrats allocate delegates, as well as the size of the field.          Under a rules change, superdelegates who are allowed to vote for any candidate they want are barred from casting a decisive vote on the first ballot. That is, if Biden does not win a majority of delegates outright, then he’ll have to win the nomination when Democrats gather in Milwaukee in July. If both Sanders and Warren can remain viable, it increases the odds that they will be able to deny Biden an outright majority.          Though there may be some degree of overlap between Warren and Sanders voters, their supporters are not interchangeable. Some Warren voters may prefer her policy proposals or simply want somebody younger or female. Sanders voters may view him as more authentically dedicated to the “revolution” or may have bought into the argument that it would be harder for a woman to beat President Trump. A recent Morning Consult found that nearly as many Sanders supporters chose Biden as their second choice (27%) as Warren (30%). Warren supporters were more likely to gravitate to Sanders as their second choice, but still, only 37% of her supporters chose him as the next best option. There is also a “Bernie or bust” crowd that would not vote if he were not on the ballot.          Were Sanders and Warren to both remain in the race through the primaries, they would be able to capture more voters collectively than they would otherwise be able to were only one of them to survive. Biden’s share of the vote will be further carved up if additional candidates, such as Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, do well enough in the early states to stay in or if Michael Bloomberg takes off in some of the later states where he's unloading tens of millions of dollars.          Anti-Trump Republicans attempted a similar strategy in 2016, hoping that the combined votes for Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, along with John Kasich, would deny Trump a majority of delegates. However, Trump benefited from a delegate allocation process that more heavily favored the statewide winner, whereas Democrats allocate delegates proportionately, meaning that even candidates who don’t win a given state can swallow up delegates if they can get to 15% either statewide or in targeted congressional districts.          As an example, when Trump won winner-take-all Florida, he received of the vote, but all 99 of the state’s delegates. In South Carolina, Trump garnered under one-third of the vote, but he claimed all 50 of the state’s delegates because with Cruz and Rubio nearly tied at 22%, Trump was able to win the state and every congressional district. Those two states alone gave him more than 10% of the total needed to capture the Republican nomination. Had the GOP followed Democratic delegate allocation rules, instead of receiving 149 delegates between those two states, Trump likely would have ended up with less than half that amount.          So though it may seem counterintuitive, no matter which one they support, liberals interested in stopping Biden should be rooting for both Warren and Sanders to remain viable for as long as possible."

       "      <td>President Barack Obama’s chief campaign strategist and senior adviser David Axelrod said that even if President Trump is impeached, it is not likely he will be convicted by the Senate and removed from office.          Appearing on CNN Tuesday evening after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry, Axelrod, 64, tossed water on some lawmakers’ hopes that impeachment would successfully remove Trump from the White House.          “This is a moment of extraordinary historical import,” Axelrod noted. “Only three presidents in history who were impeached. But it’s also true that no president in history has ever been convicted and removed from office and it is very, very unlikely that that’s going to happen here.\"          He pointed out that a large number of Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate would have to vote with the Democrats in order to form the 67 votes needed to oust the president.          “We should be sober about it. But we also kind of know how this story is going to end,” Axelrod said. “Donald Trump is not going to be removed from office, but this is overhang that he will have to deal with over the next many months as he is seeking reelection.”          Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were the only presidents to have been impeached by the House of Representatives, though neither were convicted.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Honor a congressional subpoena to appear at President Trump’s (presumably eventual) Senate impeachment trial? Joe Biden, still the odds-on favorite to be the Democrats’ standard-bearer in the 2020 election, scoffed at the very idea: No way! The former vice president’s knee-jerk obstinacy illuminates — we should say, provides even more illumination of — the patent farce that is the second article of impeachment passed by the House on a strict party-line vote: the accusation that the president has obstructed Congress. As we saw in a committee hearing, featuring the spectacle of staffers questioning staffers with no actual fact witnesses in sight, Democrats have no problem when Democrats blow off congressional demands for information. “Obstruction” is a one-way street. Trump regards the impeachment inquiry as a partisan witch hunt, just the latest phase of the Democrats’ project to remove him, which began even before his term started. He certainly has a point, although that is not a good reason to give his opponents fuel for the project, as he did by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden. That is the allegation in the first article of impeachment. Under the circumstances, I believe it falls well short of the egregious misconduct for which impeachment should be reserved; it was, nevertheless, a foolish thing for the president to do. Let’s focus, though, on the second impeachment article, obstruction of Congress. To be clear, Congress has undeniable constitutional authority, broad in scope, to conduct oversight of the executive branch. The president, with all the authority of a peer branch of government, has extensive privileges of confidentiality, rooted in Article II, particularly when it comes to communications with his staff and high executive officials. Congress, however, is empowered to probe, especially when its concern is presidential malfeasance, or the activities of executive branch agencies Congress has created — such agencies, after all, are led by officers subject to Senate confirmation, and Congress both underwrites them with taxpayer funds and limits their operations by statute.</td>\n",

Trump repeated Jeffress’ assertion on Twitter — and got an angry response from a fellow Republican: Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.          Jeffress, pastor at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, is a prominent figure on the Christian Right. And during his Sunday appearance on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends,” Jeffress insisted to co-hosts Pete Hegseth and Jedediah Bila that Trump has done nothing to deserve impeachment and attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for supporting an impeachment inquiry — stressing, “I do want to make this prediction this morning: if the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, I’m afraid it will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal.”          On Twitter, Trump quoted Jeffress and zeroed right in on the Civil War part:          Upon seeing Trump’s post, Kinzinger angrily tweeted in response, “I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.”          A 41-year-old military veteran who served in the U.S. Air Force during the Iraq War, Kinzinger was first elected to the House as a Republican in 2010.          Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives because of a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript/summary of that conversation shows that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into digging up dirt on a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden — which Pelosi, formerly the Democratic Party’s most prominent opponent of impeaching Trump, considers an impeachable offense.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trump impeachment inquiry sparked by effort to uncover ‘witch hunt’ origins</td>\n",
       "      <td>At the heart of the infamous Ukraine phone call that prompted House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is President Trump’s vow to get to the bottom of the origins of the Russia probe, which dominated the first two-plus years of his presidency.          In trying to uncover how the “witch hunt” began, Mr. Trump now faces a bigger political crisis.          The Trump campaign came out swinging this weekend against impeachment, launching a $10 million TV and digital ad accusing Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden of meddling in Ukraine. Political insiders say it’s a strong indication of how Mr. Trump intends to fight back.          “He’ll be very aggressive,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. “I think ultimately his game plan is to make sure the base is with him. He understands this is a political fight, not a legal fight, and he’s going to play politics. He knows that if he loses the base, he loses the game.”          Mr. Trump and his aides in the early days of the crisis have gone on the attack against an unnamed government whistleblower who prompted the charges while also firing back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Chairman Adam B. Schiff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The White House message is that this latest political peril for Mr. Trump is all part of the same partisan hatred that has dogged him from the start.          “There are no high crimes and misdemeanors here,” said White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. “People were talking about impeaching this president before he even got inaugurated. And now they’re getting their wish. Nancy Pelosi finally capitulated to her angry mob.”          She said the American people “will see what’s not getting done” in Congress while Democrats devote their attention to impeaching Mr. Trump in a strong economy.          The president also echoed a prediction Sunday by Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel that the Democrats’ impeachment effort will backfire, especially in Democratic House districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016.          “Will happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in 50 Trump type Districts,” the president tweeted. “We will win big!”          In trying to sustain his 2020 reelection bid, Mr. Trump is still fighting a battle over his 2016 campaign.          The president’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 started with pleasantries, but quickly shifted Mr. Trump’s interest in a missing Democratic National Committee server that was hacked by Russia during the 2016 election.          “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine … The server, they say Ukraine has it,” the president told Mr. Zelensky.          He also mentioned the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which the DNC hired in 2016 to investigate the breach of its servers and first reported Russia as the culprit.          The president’s conversation took place a day after special counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress, an appearance that was criticized as weak. Mr. Mueller did confirm the findings of his report, which found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the election.          “As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance,” Mr. Trump told Ukraine’s leader. “But they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”          The Justice Department has announced that U.S. attorney John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane” probe into alleged links between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia, was already looking into whether the Ukrainian government led by then-President Petro Poroshenko was involved in the effort to torpedo Mr. Trump’s candidacy.          Mr. Zelensky raised the name of the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani had canceled a trip to Ukraine last spring to investigate whether the previous Ukrainian administration helped Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign by providing information concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s lobbying work in the country.          Mr. Giuliani also was probing why Ukraine fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who had been looking into Hunter Biden’s lucrative position with a Ukrainian energy company.          “This is what they [Democrats] did to Manafort,” said veteran Washington lawyer John Down, who represented the president in the Mueller probe. “They went overseas and they dug all this stuff up. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”          The Hill reported in May that the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington said a Democratic National Committee contractor solicited dirt on Manafort during the 2016 campaign and even tried to enlist the country’s president to help.          The contractor later tried to arrange for Mr. Poroshenko to comment on Manafort’s Russian ties during a visit to the U.S. during the 2016 campaign, the Ukrainian ambassador said.          As for Mr. Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, the president’s conservative allies also believe there is a potential connection to the origins of the Russia allegations against Mr. Trump.          “Biden was responsible for U.S. policy in Ukraine during the Obama administration, and much of the false narrative about President Donald Trump being a Russian agent came from Ukraine, the United Kingdom and other Western intelligence agencies, which his administration put a bow on and shipped to the FISA court so they could spy on the Trump campaign in 2016,” said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government. “What did Joe Biden know about Russiagate and when did he know it?”          The president also has directed most of his campaign criticism at Mr. Biden, perceiving him as his likeliest — and probably toughest — opponent in the general election. He’s gone to considerable lengths to take him out early during the Democratic primary, openly questioning his fitness for office.          “I think he’s the weakest mentally, and I like running against people that are weak mentally,” the president said of Mr. Biden last summer.          Democrats are using the president’s effort to investigate the Bidens in Ukraine as their primary argument for impeachment, accusing the president of seeking foreign help in interfering in a U.S. election. Mr. Biden is, for now, still the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.          At the time of the phone call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine.          “I think we have to stay focused as far as the public is concerned on the fact that the president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday.          Mrs. Pelosi also suggested that Russia played a role in the saga.          “It is wrong for any foreign government to interfere in our elections and here you have the president of the United States asking for that,” she said without elaborating. “I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way.”          The White House ended the week with Mr. Trump declaring “we’re at war” with the Democrats. The president and his allies were also questioning the motives of the unnamed government whistleblower, who’s reportedly a CIA officer.          Mr. Trump last week also suggested he could go to court to stop the Democrats.          “There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts,” Mr. Trump said.          Even some Republicans close to the White House say impeachment is a real concern.          “I think there’s a good chance of impeachment,” said one administration ally. “Will he be removed [by the Senate]? No. Will he even care? I think he thinks it would be one more big reality TV moment, and he’s the star of it.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Rep. Andy Biggs: Democrats' latest attempt to take down Trump will fail, just as their other ones have</td>\n",
       "      <td>We've grown used to radical Leftists, in Congress and the media, having their soup de jour, the accusation of the day. But this latest one has actually prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry. What is the accusation? President Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president to congratulate him on his election and discussed several things, including the investigation of alleged illegal conduct on the part of the son of a prominent American politician. This is just another fail. Within the past few weeks, the Left has floated impeaching Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, criticized Vice President Mike Pence for an extended stay during a visit to his foreign, historical family home, melted down over the President’s invitation of national leaders of the G7 to one of his properties, and most ludicrously, blasted him for allegedly stealing pancakes. HANS VON SPAKOVSKY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT EFFORT WILL BE HISTORIC POLITICAL BATTLE – HERE'S HOW THE PROCESS WORKS          The media wonders why its credibility is in the dumpster. The Left wonders why the President has the approval of most Americans, higher than former President Barack Obama at the same juncture of his term. The standard bearer of the latest effort to impeach President Trump is Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of the House intelligence Committee. You will remember him for his zealous advocacy for reliance on the Mueller Report. Schiff promised that evidence of Russian collusion was real, present, and would be confirmed in the Mueller Report. Oops. The Mueller investigation did not support Schiff’s promised conclusion. In fact, it found that there was no collusion, cooperation or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. So here we are again. The Democrats desire to get the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This seems wholly unwarranted based on the allegations of an unknown person, who probably did not even hear the conversation. This individual apparently heard about the conversation from someone else. Such testimony would never be allowed in court because it is inherently unreliable. And, it reveals something about the way things work in the White House. It seems that the President has no private conversations with leaders of foreign countries. I suspect that the leaders of other nations understand that those conversations are scrutinized by the U.S. intelligence apparatus. But I also believe that foreign leaders do not anticipate that Americans are so cavalier as to transcribe these conversations and then pass them on to Congress, which seems to have the loosest of lips. In fact, foreign leaders probably do not realize there is a threat that their conversations could be leaked, if given to Schiff, a person that former Congressman Trey Gowdy has described as leakier than a screen-door on a submarine. What do the Ukrainian leaders have to say about the content of the conversation? Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko says there were no threats. There was nothing untoward or out of the ordinary in the conversation. Joe Biden once bragged that he had been in Ukraine and demanded that its leaders fire a prosecutor who was investigating allegations of wrongdoing of an international energy company, or else. Oh, by the way, Biden’s son, Hunter, sat on the board of directors of that company. Was it out of line to inquire of an American who was under investigation by the Ukrainians? They projected a false narrative for years, creating a division in our nation that may not heal for a generation, that the Trump administration is illegitimate because of Russian “collusion” in the 2016 election. But, it turns out, that Ukrainians donated tens of millions of dollars to the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee. In fact, the Ukraine government voted to investigate that. Prediction: the Left will persist in its quixotic quest to remove President Donald Trump. And, when the Ukraine telephone gambit fades, look for the next stolen pancake allegation to consume our misguided friends.</td>\n",

strategist and senior adviser David Axelrod said that even if President Trump is impeached, it is not likely he will be convicted by the Senate and removed from office.          Appearing on CNN Tuesday evening after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry, Axelrod, 64, tossed water on some lawmakers’ hopes that impeachment would successfully remove Trump from the White House.          “This is a moment of extraordinary historical import,” Axelrod noted. “Only three presidents in history who were impeached. But it’s also true that no president in history has ever been convicted and removed from office and it is very, very unlikely that that’s going to happen here.\"          He pointed out that a large number of Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate would have to vote with the Democrats in order to form the 67 votes needed to oust the president.          “We should be sober about it. But we also kind of know how this story is going to end,” Axelrod said. “Donald Trump is not going to be removed from office, but this is overhang that he will have to deal with over the next many months as he is seeking reelection.”          Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were the only presidents to have been impeached by the House of Representatives, though neither were convicted.\n",

Honor a congressional subpoena to appear at President Trump’s (presumably eventual) Senate impeachment trial? Joe Biden, still the odds-on favorite to be the Democrats’ standard-bearer in the 2020 election, scoffed at the very idea: No way! The former vice president’s knee-jerk obstinacy illuminates — we should say, provides even more illumination of — the patent farce that is the second article of impeachment passed by the House on a strict party-line vote: the accusation that the president has obstructed Congress. As we saw in a committee hearing, featuring the spectacle of staffers questioning staffers with no actual fact witnesses in sight, Democrats have no problem when Democrats blow off congressional demands for information. “Obstruction” is a one-way street. Trump regards the impeachment inquiry as a partisan witch hunt, just the latest phase of the Democrats’ project to remove him, which began even before his term started. He certainly has a point, although that is not a good reason to give his opponents fuel for the project, as he did by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden. That is the allegation in the first article of impeachment. Under the circumstances, I believe it falls well short of the egregious misconduct for which impeachment should be reserved; it was, nevertheless, a foolish thing for the president to do. Let’s focus, though, on the second impeachment article, obstruction of Congress. To be clear, Congress has undeniable constitutional authority, broad in scope, to conduct oversight of the executive branch. The president, with all the authority of a peer branch of government, has extensive privileges of confidentiality, rooted in Article II, particularly when it comes to communications with his staff and high executive officials. Congress, however, is empowered to probe, especially when its concern is presidential malfeasance, or the activities of executive branch agencies Congress has created — such agencies, after all, are led by officers subject to Senate confirmation, and Congress both underwrites them with taxpayer funds and limits their operations by statute.\n",

Appearing on Fox News on Sunday, Robert Jeffress — one of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical sycophants — asserted that Trump’s impeachment could cause “a Civil War-like fracture” in the United States. Trump repeated Jeffress’ assertion on Twitter — and got an angry response from a fellow Republican: Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.          Jeffress, pastor at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, is a prominent figure on the Christian Right. And during his Sunday appearance on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends,” Jeffress insisted to co-hosts Pete Hegseth and Jedediah Bila that Trump has done nothing to deserve impeachment and attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for supporting an impeachment inquiry — stressing, “I do want to make this prediction this morning: if the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, I’m afraid it will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal.”          On Twitter, Trump quoted Jeffress and zeroed right in on the Civil War part:          Upon seeing Trump’s post, Kinzinger angrily tweeted in response, “I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.”          A 41-year-old military veteran who served in the U.S. Air Force during the Iraq War, Kinzinger was first elected to the House as a Republican in 2010.          Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives because of a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript/summary of that conversation shows that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into digging up dirt on a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden — which Pelosi, formerly the Democratic Party’s most prominent opponent of impeaching Trump, considers an impeachable offense.\n",
       "223                                   Trump impeachment inquiry sparked by effort to uncover ‘witch hunt’ origins  At the heart of the infamous Ukraine phone call that prompted House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is President Trump’s vow to get to the bottom of the origins of the Russia probe, which dominated the first two-plus years of his presidency.          In trying to uncover how the “witch hunt” began, Mr. Trump now faces a bigger political crisis.          The Trump campaign came out swinging this weekend against impeachment, launching a $10 million TV and digital ad accusing Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden of meddling in Ukraine. Political insiders say it’s a strong indication of how Mr. Trump intends to fight back.          “He’ll be very aggressive,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. “I think ultimately his game plan is to make sure the base is with him. He understands this is a political fight, not a legal fight, and he’s going to play politics. He knows that if he loses the base, he loses the game.”          Mr. Trump and his aides in the early days of the crisis have gone on the attack against an unnamed government whistleblower who prompted the charges while also firing back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Chairman Adam B. Schiff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The White House message is that this latest political peril for Mr. Trump is all part of the same partisan hatred that has dogged him from the start.          “There are no high crimes and misdemeanors here,” said White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. “People were talking about impeaching this president before he even got inaugurated. And now they’re getting their wish. Nancy Pelosi finally capitulated to her angry mob.”          She said the American people “will see what’s not getting done” in Congress while Democrats devote their attention to impeaching Mr. Trump in a strong economy.          The president also echoed a prediction Sunday by Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel that the Democrats’ impeachment effort will backfire, especially in Democratic House districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016.          “Will happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in 50 Trump type Districts,” the president tweeted. “We will win big!”          In trying to sustain his 2020 reelection bid, Mr. Trump is still fighting a battle over his 2016 campaign.          The president’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 started with pleasantries, but quickly shifted Mr. Trump’s interest in a missing Democratic National Committee server that was hacked by Russia during the 2016 election.          “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine … The server, they say Ukraine has it,” the president told Mr. Zelensky.          He also mentioned the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which the DNC hired in 2016 to investigate the breach of its servers and first reported Russia as the culprit.          The president’s conversation took place a day after special counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress, an appearance that was criticized as weak. Mr. Mueller did confirm the findings of his report, which found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the election.          “As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance,” Mr. Trump told Ukraine’s leader. “But they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”          The Justice Department has announced that U.S. attorney John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane” probe into alleged links between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia, was already looking into whether the Ukrainian government led by then-President Petro Poroshenko was involved in the effort to torpedo Mr. Trump’s candidacy.          Mr. Zelensky raised the name of the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani had canceled a trip to Ukraine last spring to investigate whether the previous Ukrainian administration helped Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign by providing information concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s lobbying work in the country.          Mr. Giuliani also was probing why Ukraine fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who had been looking into Hunter Biden’s lucrative position with a Ukrainian energy company.          “This is what they [Democrats] did to Manafort,” said veteran Washington lawyer John Down, who represented the president in the Mueller probe. “They went overseas and they dug all this stuff up. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”          The Hill reported in May that the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington said a Democratic National Committee contractor solicited dirt on Manafort during the 2016 campaign and even tried to enlist the country’s president to help.          The contractor later tried to arrange for Mr. Poroshenko to comment on Manafort’s Russian ties during a visit to the U.S. during the 2016 campaign, the Ukrainian ambassador said.          As for Mr. Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, the president’s conservative allies also believe there is a potential connection to the origins of the Russia allegations against Mr. Trump.          “Biden was responsible for U.S. policy in Ukraine during the Obama administration, and much of the false narrative about President Donald Trump being a Russian agent came from Ukraine, the United Kingdom and other Western intelligence agencies, which his administration put a bow on and shipped to the FISA court so they could spy on the Trump campaign in 2016,” said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government. “What did Joe Biden know about Russiagate and when did he know it?”          The president also has directed most of his campaign criticism at Mr. Biden, perceiving him as his likeliest — and probably toughest — opponent in the general election. He’s gone to considerable lengths to take him out early during the Democratic primary, openly questioning his fitness for office.          “I think he’s the weakest mentally, and I like running against people that are weak mentally,” the president said of Mr. Biden last summer.          Democrats are using the president’s effort to investigate the Bidens in Ukraine as their primary argument for impeachment, accusing the president of seeking foreign help in interfering in a U.S. election. Mr. Biden is, for now, still the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.          At the time of the phone call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine.          “I think we have to stay focused as far as the public is concerned on the fact that the president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday.          Mrs. Pelosi also suggested that Russia played a role in the saga.          “It is wrong for any foreign government to interfere in our elections and here you have the president of the United States asking for that,” she said without elaborating. “I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way.”          The White House ended the week with Mr. Trump declaring “we’re at war” with the Democrats. The president and his allies were also questioning the motives of the unnamed government whistleblower, who’s reportedly a CIA officer.          Mr. Trump last week also suggested he could go to court to stop the Democrats.          “There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts,” Mr. Trump said.          Even some Republicans close to the White House say impeachment is a real concern.          “I think there’s a good chance of impeachment,” said one administration ally. “Will he be removed [by the Senate]? No. Will he even care? I think he thinks it would be one more big reality TV moment, and he’s the star of it.”\n",

But this latest one has actually prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry. What is the accusation? President Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president to congratulate him on his election and discussed several things, including the investigation of alleged illegal conduct on the part of the son of a prominent American politician. This is just another fail. Within the past few weeks, the Left has floated impeaching Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, criticized Vice President Mike Pence for an extended stay during a visit to his foreign, historical family home, melted down over the President’s invitation of national leaders of the G7 to one of his properties, and most ludicrously, blasted him for allegedly stealing pancakes. HANS VON SPAKOVSKY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT EFFORT WILL BE HISTORIC POLITICAL BATTLE – HERE'S HOW THE PROCESS WORKS          The media wonders why its credibility is in the dumpster. The Left wonders why the President has the approval of most Americans, higher than former President Barack Obama at the same juncture of his term. The standard bearer of the latest effort to impeach President Trump is Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of the House intelligence Committee. You will remember him for his zealous advocacy for reliance on the Mueller Report. Schiff promised that evidence of Russian collusion was real, present, and would be confirmed in the Mueller Report. Oops. The Mueller investigation did not support Schiff’s promised conclusion. In fact, it found that there was no collusion, cooperation or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. So here we are again. The Democrats desire to get the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This seems wholly unwarranted based on the allegations of an unknown person, who probably did not even hear the conversation. This individual apparently heard about the conversation from someone else. Such testimony would never be allowed in court because it is inherently unreliable. And, it reveals something about the way things work in the White House. It seems that the President has no private conversations with leaders of foreign countries. I suspect that the leaders of other nations understand that those conversations are scrutinized by the U.S. intelligence apparatus. But I also believe that foreign leaders do not anticipate that Americans are so cavalier as to transcribe these conversations and then pass them on to Congress, which seems to have the loosest of lips. In fact, foreign leaders probably do not realize there is a threat that their conversations could be leaked, if given to Schiff, a person that former Congressman Trey Gowdy has described as leakier than a screen-door on a submarine. What do the Ukrainian leaders have to say about the content of the conversation? Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko says there were no threats. There was nothing untoward or out of the ordinary in the conversation. Joe Biden once bragged that he had been in Ukraine and demanded that its leaders fire a prosecutor who was investigating allegations of wrongdoing of an international energy company, or else. Oh, by the way, Biden’s son, Hunter, sat on the board of directors of that company. Was it out of line to inquire of an American who was under investigation by the Ukrainians? They projected a false narrative for years, creating a division in our nation that may not heal for a generation, that the Trump administration is illegitimate because of Russian “collusion” in the 2016 election. But, it turns out, that Ukrainians donated tens of millions of dollars to the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee. In fact, the Ukraine government voted to investigate that. Prediction: the Left will persist in its quixotic quest to remove President Donald Trump. And, when the Ukraine telephone gambit fades, look for the next stolen pancake allegation to consume our misguided friends."

       "      <td>White House wants Senate trial rules to include ability to dismiss Trump charges</td>\n",
       "      <td>Republicans are debating including in the Senate resolution, which would govern the rules of the trial, a provision to dismiss the charges, something that would require 51 votes and would stop the trial in its tracks.          But moving ahead with a dismissal vote could put Republicans up for reelection in a tough spot if they are seen as moving too quickly to dismiss the case. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could not afford to lose more than two votes -- and GOP sources say the Kentucky Republican currently does not have enough votes to simply dismiss the case.          McConnell has made clear to his colleagues that he wants Trump to emerge victorious in the trial and is not willing to hold a vote that could fail, sources said. He's also keenly aware of what a vote to dismiss would look like politically, according to Republican senators, and has shepherded his conference away from the idea for several weeks.          Once the trial has begun, the Senate can vote on the merits of the articles of impeachment and choose to acquit Trump, something that can be done with only 34 votes because the Constitution requires 67 votes to convict the President and remove him from office. GOP proponents of this move argue Trump would have a stronger argument to say he was exonerated on the merits of the case, rather than simply relying on a procedural vote to dismiss the charges. Trump, though, might have to wait longer for a vote on acquittal to occur.          Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of McConnell's leadership team, said Monday he would prefer a vote to acquit the President on the merits, rather than seek a quick vote to dismiss the charges. \"That would be my advice. Let both sides have their say and have their vote.\" And Cornyn downplayed a weekend tweet from Trump calling for an \"outright dismissal.\" \"At different times, the President has expressed different views,\" Cornyn said. \"I wouldn't get too distracted by an intervening tweet.\" While Republicans are short of the votes to dismiss the charges, the issue remains a point of discussion due to McConnell's insistence that the initial rules of the trial hew closely to those used in President Bill Clinton's trial in 1999 . That resolution included a motion to dismiss, which failed. Republican senators this time around have been debating whether to remove it entirely, or push it further back in the proceedings than where it was structured then, senators familiar with the discussions said. The White House wants to keep the motion to dismiss in play because \"there's no reason to take options off the table at the beginning of the whole process,\" said one source familiar with the discussions. McConnell has counseled Republicans privately that they can decide how to proceed after both the House Democratic impeachment managers and President's defense team make their cases, followed by questions from senators. At that point, GOP senators must decide whether to allow witnesses, seek to acquit the President or move to dismiss the case. \"Yes, I am,\" Sen. Lamar Alexander, a retiring Tennessee Republican and McConnell confidante, said Monday when asked if he's open to witnesses. \"What I think is important is we have a vote on whether we need additional documents and witnesses. And that would only be appropriate after we've heard the case and asked our questions.\" That tracks directly with the model McConnell has touted now for weeks: a Senate resolution governing the trial that follow the procedures of Clinton's trial. In that Clinton resolution, the Senate included a motion to dismiss the charges after opening arguments were delivered and after senators asked their questions. About two weeks into the Clinton trial, Democrats forced a vote to dismiss the charges. But that dismissal measure failed, 44-56, and the trial continued for another two-and-half weeks. McConnell hinted last week that the Senate resolution would include a provision allowing the charges to be dismissed, but senators said the talks about how to handle the motion to dismiss still hadn't been finalized. \"We're going to have a similar resolution,\" McConnell told reporters. \"It may not be word for word, exactly the same, but a similar resolution. And we'll be glad to show it to you when -- when we unveil it.\" McConnell fueled Democratic concerns about dismissing the charges outright when he signed onto a resolution sponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, that would allow a senator to offer a motion to dismiss if the House did not transmit the articles of impeachment within 25 days. The viability of Hawley's resolution was viewed as limited to impossible -- it would require a Senate rule change, which would take 67 votes to occur. Republicans only control 53 seats in the chamber. McConnell could move to drop the vote threshold to 51, but it would require him to \"go nuclear,\" or move to eliminate the legislative filibuster, something he has long opposed. A source familiar with McConnell's decision to support the resolution said he backed \"the spirit\" of Hawley's idea given the frustration over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to hold onto the articles for more than three weeks, but wasn't planning to push forward on it given its prospects. Pelosi's about to hit send on the impeachment articles But McConnell's decision to sign onto the idea drew sharp criticism from Pelosi, who demanded to see the Senate resolution and understand how the dismissal provision would be structured before sending over the articles of impeachment that would initiate the trial. She ultimately relented and indicated that the articles would be sent over this week. ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Dismissing is a coverup ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Over the weekend, Trump argued that having a trial would add credibility to the Democrats' case, calling for a dismissal of the charges. \"Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, 'no pressure' Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have,\" Trump tweeted. \"I agree!\" This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Capitol Hill reporters protest expected restrictions on media access during Senate impeachment trial</td>\n",
       "      <td>The letter — addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) — said Capitol security officials are considering measures that are all but certain to make it harder for journalists to report on the trial and question senators about their actions.          A magnetometer in the Senate press gallery will require reporters to trickle into the chamber one at a time. Electronic devices will be banned, leaving reporters to scuttle in and out of the room to send tweets and emails. Reporters will be placed in pens, roping them off and restricting their ability to speak freely with senators as they enter and exit.          “Currently,” Wire tweeted, “we can walk with Senators as they enter the chamber, wait for them outside of meetings or lunches. It leads to a diversity of voices. Penning us means people across the country might not hear from their senator.”          Officials have also proposed limiting video coverage of the arrival of the articles of impeachment to a single pool camera with no audio, she said.          “These potential restrictions fail to acknowledge what currently works on Capitol Hill, or the way the American public expects to be able to follow a vital news event about their government in the digital age,” the committee’s letter read.          Details about the nature and scope of the restrictions under consideration remained unclear, as neither the Senate sergeant at arms nor the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, which are responsible for them, has issued a formal document.          “You’ll have to decide where’s the best place to watch; it’s like watching a football game,” Blunt said. “Where’s the best place to watch it?”          Blunt told the Star that while most of the trial will be broadcast, other segments will be closed, in line with procedures during the trial of President Bill Clinton in early 1999. “I mean closed session,” he said. “I mean there will be nobody there but senators and essential staff. No cameras, no C-SPAN, no coverage.”          He said that “part of the decision about access” for reporters to senators “will be driven by how quickly you can clear the room” for the closed sessions, “so you can have that debate and get people back into the room so you can move forward.”          Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, called the restrictions “a big mistake” in comments to reporters after Tuesday night’s Democratic candidate debate in Des Moines, where she is campaigning for the party’s presidential nomination.          The correspondents’ committee said members raised concerns with the sergeant at arms and the Rules Committee. “But decisions are being made quickly as plans for the trial are completed,” the letter read, “and we are hearing that nearly every suggestion has been rejected without an explanation of how the restrictions contribute to safety rather than simply limit coverage of the trial.”          News of the restrictions prompted alarm online from reporters, with some protesting the move as one that will effectively shield senators from scrutiny during the trial.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Some House Democrats push Pelosi to withhold impeachment articles, delay Senate trial</td>\n",
       "      <td>The gambit has gained some traction inside the left wing of the House Democratic Caucus this week. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said Wednesday, as his colleagues debated the impeachment articles on the House floor, that he has spoken to three dozen Democratic lawmakers who had expressed some level of enthusiasm for the idea of “rounding out the record and spending the time to do this right.”          Another Democrat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said there is “serious concern about whether there will be a fair trial on the Senate side” and acknowledged active talks about withholding the articles.          The notion has been most prominently advocated by Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor who has advised the House Judiciary Committee on the impeachment process. In a recent medianame op-ed, he wrote that “the public has a right to observe a meaningful trial rather than simply learn that the result is a verdict of not guilty.”          Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has asked McConnell to call several Trump administration witnesses, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. McConnell has dismissed those requests and signaled that he expects to hold a relatively short trial that will end with a summary dismissal of the impeachment charges.          Republicans have scoffed at the notion of the House withholding the articles, noting it hardly counts as leverage to deny the GOP the ability to remove a president that the party wants to keep in place. Some aides further argued that withholding the articles would only fuel Republican arguments that Democrats are engaged in a partisan abuse of the Constitution.          But Democratic leaders may be forced to deal with the issue in the coming days. Blumenauer said he had already raised it with Pelosi (Calif.), House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (Md.) and other top party leaders.          Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Hoyer did not rule out the idea: “It’s an interesting proposal. I don’t think that that’s the path we will follow, but that does not mean we will immediately deliver it. There are considerations related to other legislation.”          A senior Democratic aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations said the impeachment articles will not be immediately transmitted to the Senate on Wednesday. Rather, they will be held until Pelosi names impeachment managers, the House members who will present the case for Trump’s removal in the Senate.          “There will be a debate and vote on that resolution” naming the managers, the aide said. If a significant number of Democrats refuse to vote for that resolution, they could force the issue.          The timing of that vote is unclear; the House is expected to recess for the winter holidays as soon as Thursday and not return until Jan. 7.          Blumenauer said that if McConnell does not agree to call the Democratic witnesses and stage a fair trial, Democrats could simply hold on to the articles indefinitely and continue to investigate Trump. The House is involved in multiple court cases seeking documents and testimony that have yet to be resolved.          “Who knows what would happen to augment the record? This ought to be able to play out,” he said. “There’s no advantage to rushing this.”          But the notion of prolonging the impeachment process indefinitely is almost certain to infuriate House members from competitive districts, who have pushed Pelosi for months to keep the investigation focused and limited to Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine.          Blumenauer declined to discuss whether members interested in the gambit would withhold their votes on naming managers to force the issue: “I’m not interested in sparking controversy in the caucus,” he said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\"The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.\" – George Orwell, \"1984\"          The Senate impeachment trial of President Trump ended not with a bang but a whimper. What different outcome could one expect from a trial without so much as a single witness, a single document, any cross-examination or a defendant respectful enough to show up? Law students are taught early on that a trial is not a grudge match or an ordeal; it is a search for the truth. Trial lawyers know that cross-examination is the most effective truth-testing tool available to them. But the search for the truth requires witnesses, and when the command from Senate Republican leaders came down that there shall be no witnesses, the truth-telling mission of Trump's trial was radically transformed into a steamroller of political power. GREGG JARRETT: TRUMP ACQUITTAL IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS A HUMILIATING DEFEAT FOR PARTISAN DEMOCRATS          And in its wake is a Congress ceding power to the presidency, almost as if the states had ratified a constitutional amendment redefining the impeachment language to permit a president to engage in high crimes and misdemeanors so long as he believes that they are in the national interest and so long as his party has an iron-clad grip on the Senate. How could presidential crimes be in the national interest? Here is the backstory. When the House of Representatives voted in favor of two articles of impeachment against Trump, it characterized his lawlessness as contempt of Congress and an abuse of power. The contempt of Congress consisted of Trump's orders to subordinates to disregard congressional subpoenas. Both Republican- and Democratic-controlled Houses of Representatives have deemed such presidential instructions in an impeachment inquiry as impeachable per se. The abuse allegations address Trump's solicitation of assistance for his reelection campaign from a foreign government by holding up the release of $391 million in military aid to the same foreign government. These funds were congressionally appropriated and ordered to be paid by legislation that Trump had signed into law. Federal law prohibits such solicitation as criminal and prohibits government officials from seeking personal favors in return for performing their governmental duties. The latter is bribery. Because the solicitation that Trump committed was a crime against the government, it is among those referred to when the Constitution was written as a \"high\" crime. High crimes are a constitutional basis for impeachment, along with bribery and treason. The evidence that Trump did this is overwhelming and beyond a reasonable doubt, and no one with firsthand knowledge denied it. Numerous government officials recounted that the presidential leverage of $391 million in U.S. assistance for a personal political favor did occur and the government's own watchdog concluded that it was indisputably unlawful. The favor Trump sought was an announcement by the Ukrainian government of the commencement of an investigation of Trump's potential presidential foe, former Vice President Joe Biden. While the Senate was hearing House prosecution managers argue their case, and Trump's lawyers challenged those arguments, The New York Times revealed that John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, had authored an as yet unpublished book demonstrating that the House case against Trump was true. True because, unlike the senators who shut their eyes and ears at Trump's trial, Bolton saw for himself the presidential tit-for-tat machinations that the House had alleged and, if proven, were criminal and impeachable. The Times also revealed the existence of 24 emails sent by Trump aides manifesting indisputably his lawless behavior. But the emails are secret. At the same time, two signal events occurred in the impeachment trial. The first was an argument by Trump's lawyers that every president seeking reelection believes his victory will be in the national interest and thus all presidential efforts toward that victory are constitutional and lawful. This morally bankrupt, intellectually dishonest argument – which effectively resuscitates from history's graveyard President Richard Nixon’s logic that \"when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal\" because the president is above the law – must have resonated with Senate Republican leaders. The leaders coerced their Senate Republican colleagues into embracing the view that – since the president did not want Bolton to testify or White House emails to be revealed – they must bar all witnesses and documents. The second signal event was shameful. It was the 51 to 49 Senate vote to bar witnesses and documents from the trial. Do innocent people behave this way? If Trump really believes he did not commit any crimes and any impeachable offenses, why would he orchestrate blocking evidence? And who – having taken an oath to do \"impartial justice\" – would close their eyes to the truth? How could such a marathon of speeches possibly be considered a trial? Trump will luxuriate in his victory. But the personal victory for him is a legal assault on the Constitution. The president has taken an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. Instead, he has trashed it. By manipulating Senate Republicans to bar firsthand evidence and keep it from senatorial and public scrutiny, Trump and his Senate collaborators have insulated him and future presidents from the moral and constitutional truism that no president is above the law.</td>\n",

President trop is looking for the GOP senate for vindication but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Good mornings and in Canada Democrats are hoping to have witnesses testify as part of president trying to send trial that Republicans have already rejected that request to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hoping. Threatening to possibly delay president trumps trial. Could give her leverage. History put on hold president from becoming just the third president in US history to be impeached. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now refusing to take the next steps. Saying she wolf said articles of impeachment over to the set net. Until majority leader Mitch McConnell reveals with the president's trial will look like. Act founders owning both the constitution. They suspected that there could be a blow president. I don't think they suspected that with have a role president and rogue leader in the senate at the same time. Democrats have been pushing to hear from four witnesses the White House had blocked from testifying. Including acting chief of staff make Maldini and former national security advisor John Bolton. The issue coming up at last night's democratic debate. It president trop. Thinks that he should not be impeached he should not scared to what or where his own witnesses. But McConnell has already rejected that request. Indicating he wants a speedy trial and that he's working in total coordination with the White House Democrats are hoping threatening to possibly delay trumps trial will give them leverage. But for now at least Republicans aren't waiting. Looks like prosecutors are getting cold fate. In front of the entire country. And second guessing whether that you don't want the go to trial. President chopper responding on Twitter writing Pelosi is afraid to present impeachment to the senate. And adding so after Democrats gave me no due process in the house no lawyers no witnesses no nothing. They now want to tell the senate how to run their trial we think that what they did is unconstitutional. And lawmakers are hoping to have that senate trial begin the week of January 6 but that will all depend on when house speaker Pelosi decides to send those articles of impeachment.

       "61                         White House wants Senate trial rules to include ability to dismiss Trump charges  Republicans are debating including in the Senate resolution, which would govern the rules of the trial, a provision to dismiss the charges, something that would require 51 votes and would stop the trial in its tracks.          But moving ahead with a dismissal vote could put Republicans up for reelection in a tough spot if they are seen as moving too quickly to dismiss the case. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could not afford to lose more than two votes -- and GOP sources say the Kentucky Republican currently does not have enough votes to simply dismiss the case.          McConnell has made clear to his colleagues that he wants Trump to emerge victorious in the trial and is not willing to hold a vote that could fail, sources said. He's also keenly aware of what a vote to dismiss would look like politically, according to Republican senators, and has shepherded his conference away from the idea for several weeks.          Once the trial has begun, the Senate can vote on the merits of the articles of impeachment and choose to acquit Trump, something that can be done with only 34 votes because the Constitution requires 67 votes to convict the President and remove him from office. GOP proponents of this move argue Trump would have a stronger argument to say he was exonerated on the merits of the case, rather than simply relying on a procedural vote to dismiss the charges. Trump, though, might have to wait longer for a vote on acquittal to occur.          Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of McConnell's leadership team, said Monday he would prefer a vote to acquit the President on the merits, rather than seek a quick vote to dismiss the charges. \"That would be my advice. Let both sides have their say and have their vote.\" And Cornyn downplayed a weekend tweet from Trump calling for an \"outright dismissal.\" \"At different times, the President has expressed different views,\" Cornyn said. \"I wouldn't get too distracted by an intervening tweet.\" While Republicans are short of the votes to dismiss the charges, the issue remains a point of discussion due to McConnell's insistence that the initial rules of the trial hew closely to those used in President Bill Clinton's trial in 1999 . That resolution included a motion to dismiss, which failed. Republican senators this time around have been debating whether to remove it entirely, or push it further back in the proceedings than where it was structured then, senators familiar with the discussions said. The White House wants to keep the motion to dismiss in play because \"there's no reason to take options off the table at the beginning of the whole process,\" said one source familiar with the discussions. McConnell has counseled Republicans privately that they can decide how to proceed after both the House Democratic impeachment managers and President's defense team make their cases, followed by questions from senators. At that point, GOP senators must decide whether to allow witnesses, seek to acquit the President or move to dismiss the case. \"Yes, I am,\" Sen. Lamar Alexander, a retiring Tennessee Republican and McConnell confidante, said Monday when asked if he's open to witnesses. \"What I think is important is we have a vote on whether we need additional documents and witnesses. And that would only be appropriate after we've heard the case and asked our questions.\" That tracks directly with the model McConnell has touted now for weeks: a Senate resolution governing the trial that follow the procedures of Clinton's trial. In that Clinton resolution, the Senate included a motion to dismiss the charges after opening arguments were delivered and after senators asked their questions. About two weeks into the Clinton trial, Democrats forced a vote to dismiss the charges. But that dismissal measure failed, 44-56, and the trial continued for another two-and-half weeks. McConnell hinted last week that the Senate resolution would include a provision allowing the charges to be dismissed, but senators said the talks about how to handle the motion to dismiss still hadn't been finalized. \"We're going to have a similar resolution,\" McConnell told reporters. \"It may not be word for word, exactly the same, but a similar resolution. And we'll be glad to show it to you when -- when we unveil it.\" McConnell fueled Democratic concerns about dismissing the charges outright when he signed onto a resolution sponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, that would allow a senator to offer a motion to dismiss if the House did not transmit the articles of impeachment within 25 days. The viability of Hawley's resolution was viewed as limited to impossible -- it would require a Senate rule change, which would take 67 votes to occur. Republicans only control 53 seats in the chamber. McConnell could move to drop the vote threshold to 51, but it would require him to \"go nuclear,\" or move to eliminate the legislative filibuster, something he has long opposed. A source familiar with McConnell's decision to support the resolution said he backed \"the spirit\" of Hawley's idea given the frustration over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to hold onto the articles for more than three weeks, but wasn't planning to push forward on it given its prospects. Pelosi's about to hit send on the impeachment articles But McConnell's decision to sign onto the idea drew sharp criticism from Pelosi, who demanded to see the Senate resolution and understand how the dismissal provision would be structured before sending over the articles of impeachment that would initiate the trial. She ultimately relented and indicated that the articles would be sent over this week. ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Dismissing is a coverup ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Over the weekend, Trump argued that having a trial would add credibility to the Democrats' case, calling for a dismissal of the charges. \"Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, 'no pressure' Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have,\" Trump tweeted. \"I agree!\" This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.\n",

Schumer (D-N.Y.) — said Capitol security officials are considering measures that are all but certain to make it harder for journalists to report on the trial and question senators about their actions.          A magnetometer in the Senate press gallery will require reporters to trickle into the chamber one at a time. Electronic devices will be banned, leaving reporters to scuttle in and out of the room to send tweets and emails. Reporters will be placed in pens, roping them off and restricting their ability to speak freely with senators as they enter and exit.          “Currently,” Wire tweeted, “we can walk with Senators as they enter the chamber, wait for them outside of meetings or lunches. It leads to a diversity of voices. Penning us means people across the country might not hear from their senator.”          Officials have also proposed limiting video coverage of the arrival of the articles of impeachment to a single pool camera with no audio, she said.          “These potential restrictions fail to acknowledge what currently works on Capitol Hill, or the way the American public expects to be able to follow a vital news event about their government in the digital age,” the committee’s letter read.          Details about the nature and scope of the restrictions under consideration remained unclear, as neither the Senate sergeant at arms nor the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, which are responsible for them, has issued a formal document.          “You’ll have to decide where’s the best place to watch; it’s like watching a football game,” Blunt said. “Where’s the best place to watch it?”          Blunt told the Star that while most of the trial will be broadcast, other segments will be closed, in line with procedures during the trial of President Bill Clinton in early 1999. “I mean closed session,” he said. “I mean there will be nobody there but senators and essential staff. No cameras, no C-SPAN, no coverage.”          He said that “part of the decision about access” for reporters to senators “will be driven by how quickly you can clear the room” for the closed sessions, “so you can have that debate and get people back into the room so you can move forward.”          Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, called the restrictions “a big mistake” in comments to reporters after Tuesday night’s Democratic candidate debate in Des Moines, where she is campaigning for the party’s presidential nomination.          The correspondents’ committee said members raised concerns with the sergeant at arms and the Rules Committee. “But decisions are being made quickly as plans for the trial are completed,” the letter read, “and we are hearing that nearly every suggestion has been rejected without an explanation of how the restrictions contribute to safety rather than simply limit coverage of the trial.”          News of the restrictions prompted alarm online from reporters, with some protesting the move as one that will effectively shield senators from scrutiny during the trial.\n",

Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said Wednesday, as his colleagues debated the impeachment articles on the House floor, that he has spoken to three dozen Democratic lawmakers who had expressed some level of enthusiasm for the idea of “rounding out the record and spending the time to do this right.”          Another Democrat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said there is “serious concern about whether there will be a fair trial on the Senate side” and acknowledged active talks about withholding the articles.          The notion has been most prominently advocated by Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor who has advised the House Judiciary Committee on the impeachment process. In a recent medianame op-ed, he wrote that “the public has a right to observe a meaningful trial rather than simply learn that the result is a verdict of not guilty.”          Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has asked McConnell to call several Trump administration witnesses, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. McConnell has dismissed those requests and signaled that he expects to hold a relatively short trial that will end with a summary dismissal of the impeachment charges.          Republicans have scoffed at the notion of the House withholding the articles, noting it hardly counts as leverage to deny the GOP the ability to remove a president that the party wants to keep in place. Some aides further argued that withholding the articles would only fuel Republican arguments that Democrats are engaged in a partisan abuse of the Constitution.          But Democratic leaders may be forced to deal with the issue in the coming days. Blumenauer said he had already raised it with Pelosi (Calif.), House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (Md.) and other top party leaders.          Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Hoyer did not rule out the idea: “It’s an interesting proposal. I don’t think that that’s the path we will follow, but that does not mean we will immediately deliver it. There are considerations related to other legislation.”          A senior Democratic aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations said the impeachment articles will not be immediately transmitted to the Senate on Wednesday. Rather, they will be held until Pelosi names impeachment managers, the House members who will present the case for Trump’s removal in the Senate.          “There will be a debate and vote on that resolution” naming the managers, the aide said. If a significant number of Democrats refuse to vote for that resolution, they could force the issue.          The timing of that vote is unclear; the House is expected to recess for the winter holidays as soon as Thursday and not return until Jan. 7.          Blumenauer said that if McConnell does not agree to call the Democratic witnesses and stage a fair trial, Democrats could simply hold on to the articles indefinitely and continue to investigate Trump. The House is involved in multiple court cases seeking documents and testimony that have yet to be resolved.          “Who knows what would happen to augment the record? This ought to be able to play out,” he said. “There’s no advantage to rushing this.”          But the notion of prolonging the impeachment process indefinitely is almost certain to infuriate House members from competitive districts, who have pushed Pelosi for months to keep the investigation focused and limited to Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine.          Blumenauer declined to discuss whether members interested in the gambit would withhold their votes on naming managers to force the issue: “I’m not interested in sparking controversy in the caucus,” he said.\n",

It was their final, most essential command.\" – George Orwell, \"1984\"          The Senate impeachment trial of President Trump ended not with a bang but a whimper. What different outcome could one expect from a trial without so much as a single witness, a single document, any cross-examination or a defendant respectful enough to show up? Law students are taught early on that a trial is not a grudge match or an ordeal; it is a search for the truth. Trial lawyers know that cross-examination is the most effective truth-testing tool available to them. But the search for the truth requires witnesses, and when the command from Senate Republican leaders came down that there shall be no witnesses, the truth-telling mission of Trump's trial was radically transformed into a steamroller of political power. GREGG JARRETT: TRUMP ACQUITTAL IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS A HUMILIATING DEFEAT FOR PARTISAN DEMOCRATS          And in its wake is a Congress ceding power to the presidency, almost as if the states had ratified a constitutional amendment redefining the impeachment language to permit a president to engage in high crimes and misdemeanors so long as he believes that they are in the national interest and so long as his party has an iron-clad grip on the Senate. How could presidential crimes be in the national interest? Here is the backstory. When the House of Representatives voted in favor of two articles of impeachment against Trump, it characterized his lawlessness as contempt of Congress and an abuse of power. The contempt of Congress consisted of Trump's orders to subordinates to disregard congressional subpoenas. Both Republican- and Democratic-controlled Houses of Representatives have deemed such presidential instructions in an impeachment inquiry as impeachable per se. The abuse allegations address Trump's solicitation of assistance for his reelection campaign from a foreign government by holding up the release of $391 million in military aid to the same foreign government. These funds were congressionally appropriated and ordered to be paid by legislation that Trump had signed into law. Federal law prohibits such solicitation as criminal and prohibits government officials from seeking personal favors in return for performing their governmental duties. The latter is bribery. Because the solicitation that Trump committed was a crime against the government, it is among those referred to when the Constitution was written as a \"high\" crime. High crimes are a constitutional basis for impeachment, along with bribery and treason. The evidence that Trump did this is overwhelming and beyond a reasonable doubt, and no one with firsthand knowledge denied it. Numerous government officials recounted that the presidential leverage of $391 million in U.S. assistance for a personal political favor did occur and the government's own watchdog concluded that it was indisputably unlawful. The favor Trump sought was an announcement by the Ukrainian government of the commencement of an investigation of Trump's potential presidential foe, former Vice President Joe Biden. While the Senate was hearing House prosecution managers argue their case, and Trump's lawyers challenged those arguments, The New York Times revealed that John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, had authored an as yet unpublished book demonstrating that the House case against Trump was true. True because, unlike the senators who shut their eyes and ears at Trump's trial, Bolton saw for himself the presidential tit-for-tat machinations that the House had alleged and, if proven, were criminal and impeachable. The Times also revealed the existence of 24 emails sent by Trump aides manifesting indisputably his lawless behavior. But the emails are secret. At the same time, two signal events occurred in the impeachment trial. The first was an argument by Trump's lawyers that every president seeking reelection believes his victory will be in the national interest and thus all presidential efforts toward that victory are constitutional and lawful. This morally bankrupt, intellectually dishonest argument – which effectively resuscitates from history's graveyard President Richard Nixon’s logic that \"when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal\" because the president is above the law – must have resonated with Senate Republican leaders. The leaders coerced their Senate Republican colleagues into embracing the view that – since the president did not want Bolton to testify or White House emails to be revealed – they must bar all witnesses and documents. The second signal event was shameful. It was the 51 to 49 Senate vote to bar witnesses and documents from the trial. Do innocent people behave this way? If Trump really believes he did not commit any crimes and any impeachable offenses, why would he orchestrate blocking evidence? And who – having taken an oath to do \"impartial justice\" – would close their eyes to the truth? How could such a marathon of speeches possibly be considered a trial? Trump will luxuriate in his victory. But the personal victory for him is a legal assault on the Constitution. The president has taken an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. Instead, he has trashed it. By manipulating Senate Republicans to bar firsthand evidence and keep it from senatorial and public scrutiny, Trump and his Senate collaborators have insulated him and future presidents from the moral and constitutional truism that no president is above the law.\n",

President trop is looking for the GOP senate for vindication but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It's throwing a wrench in the plans medianame the nest Iraq or Tara has the latest from Washington and that's good morning. Good mornings and in Canada Democrats are hoping to have witnesses testify as part of president trying to send trial that Republicans have already rejected that request to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hoping. Threatening to possibly delay president trumps trial. Could give her leverage. History put on hold president from becoming just the third president in US history to be impeached. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now refusing to take the next steps. Saying she wolf said articles of impeachment over to the set net. Until majority leader Mitch McConnell reveals with the president's trial will look like. Act founders owning both the constitution. They suspected that there could be a blow president. I don't think they suspected that with have a role president and rogue leader in the senate at the same time. Democrats have been pushing to hear from four witnesses the White House had blocked from testifying. Including acting chief of staff make Maldini and former national security advisor John Bolton. The issue coming up at last night's democratic debate. It president trop. Thinks that he should not be impeached he should not scared to what or where his own witnesses. But McConnell has already rejected that request. Indicating he wants a speedy trial and that he's working in total coordination with the White House Democrats are hoping threatening to possibly delay trumps trial will give them leverage. But for now at least Republicans aren't waiting. Looks like prosecutors are getting cold fate. In front of the entire country. And second guessing whether that you don't want the go to trial. President chopper responding on Twitter writing Pelosi is afraid to present impeachment to the senate. And adding so after Democrats gave me no due process in the house no lawyers no witnesses no nothing. They now want to tell the senate how to run their trial we think that what they did is unconstitutional. And lawmakers are hoping to have that senate trial begin the week of January 6 but that will all depend on when house speaker Pelosi decides to send those articles of impeachment. Over to the senate to name Kenneth."

       "      <td>Syria awarded Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani its highest military honor on Monday while Iranian student protesters took to the streets to tear down posters set up in his memory. Soleimani was killed in a U.S. airstrike outside Iraq’s Baghdad International Airport on Jan. 2.          Syrian Prime Minister Imad Khamis announced that President Bashar Assad had awarded Soleimani the medal while meeting with Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri in Tehran. “Awarding this medal reveals the Syrian president’s deep affection for Gen. Soleimani and for his brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Khamis said, according to Iran’s Tasnim News.          The medal was not named in the news article but was described as Syria's \"top medal of honor.\"          Meanwhile, protesters walked the streets of Iran, chanting anti-government statements and claiming Soleimani was no hero.          \"Soleimani was a murderer, his leader is, too,\" protesters chanted, referring to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.                               The posthumous award from Syria was predictable, one Iran-watcher said.          “No surprise that an Iranian client state would do this, and no surprise of course that Assad would do it,” former intelligence officer Michael Pregent told the medianame. Giving Soleimani the award is “slapping the face” of the hundreds of thousands of people who have died in the Syrian civil war, Pregent said.                               As head of Iran's Quds Force, Soleimani directed covert operations across the Middle East. More than 600 U.S. troops died due to Iranian support of insurgents in Iraq, according to the Department of Defense. Additionally, Iran is credited with helping save Assad, a key ally, by providing troops, weapons, and training to his regime as it continues to fight a civil war.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a United States airstrike in Baghdad on Thursday will likely unite Iran and its allies in mourning the man some considered to be Tehran's second most powerful leader. But little is known outside the Middle East about the man who played such a key role in shaping conflicts across the region. The 62-year-old led the elite Quds Force, part of Iran's Revolutionary Guards that also reports to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Soleimani was also accused of controlling proxy militias across the Middle East including ones in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. He has been characterized as a murderer by many U.S. government officials, ranging from President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Announcing his death, the Pentagon blamed Soleimani for orchestrating a series of attacks on allied bases in Iraq in recent months, most recently a rocket strike last week that killed a U.S. contractor and wounded four other service members. That killing prompted the U.S. to conduct five airstrikes across Iraq and Syria, targeting an Iranian-backed militia group it said was responsible for the attack. In turn, those bombings saw hundreds of the militia's supporters storm the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad. The Pentagon also said Soleimani had been actively developing plans to attack U.S. diplomats and service members in Iraq and elsewhere throughout the region. On Friday, Khamenei called Soleimani a martyr and declared a three-day national mourning period for him and other senior officials killed in the airstrike. \"He was a stellar example of those educated and nurtured in Islam,\" Khamenei said in a statement Friday that also called for \"severe revenge.\" Soleimani led the Quds, which is designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. and was considered the most powerful intelligence operative in the Middle East, for more than two decades. He was behind the seizure of the Iraqi oil-rich city of Kirkuk from American-allied Kurdish forces in 2017. He helped negotiate for the Iraqi government and Shiite militias to take the city largely uncontested. It was viewed as an embarrassing strategic blow to the U.S. at the time. But Soleimani is also credited with fighting the Islamic State militant group in Iraq. In a 2017 public letter, he denounced the \"evil movement\" that managed \"to deceive tens of thousands of Muslim youth\" in Iraq and Syria, while also blaming the U.S. for the rise and spread of ISIS. Iran had launched airstrikes against ISIS fighters outside Baghdad in late 2014 just as the United States and its coalition partners were taking on the extremist group. ISIS, made up of Sunni extremists, was ideologically at odds with Soleimani and the Iranian Shiite regime he defended. Soleimani and his commanders were on the front lines in Iraq and his name became synonymous with victories attributed to Iraqi ground forces. He had presented himself as the face of the offensive in Tikrit, a city which fell under ISIS control in 2014. Iran sought to highlight his efforts against ISIS while protesting his death Friday. Zarif said the slain general had dedicated his life \"to fighting tyranny, oppression, terror and extremism.\" Reported to have been raised in poverty in the mountains of eastern Iran, Soleimani went from being a construction worker to climbing the ranks of Iran's military as a young man following the Islamic Revolution of 1979. He became known as a war hero and a patriot, risking his life to minimize casualties among his men in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, according to a 2011 American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research report. His track record includes support of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The United Nations had imposed an asset freeze and travel ban on him in 2007, and the U.S. sanctioned him again in response to his alleged involvement in the Syrian war in 2011. Long known as the \"shadow commander\" in Western media, his profile was raised in 2015 as Iranian outlets began releasing photos of him in the battlefield guiding the war against ISIS. His face was soon plastered on T-shirts and his name mentioned in Shiite music videos. His power was compared to that of a vice president.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BAGHDAD (AP) — Thousands of mourners chanting “America is the Great Satan” marched in a funeral procession Saturday through Baghdad for Iran's top general and Iraqi militant leaders, who were killed in a U.S. airstrike. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds force and mastermind of its regional security strategy, was killed in an airstrike early Friday near the Iraqi capital's international airport that has caused regional tensions to soar. Iran has vowed harsh retaliation, raising fears of an all-outwar. U.S. President Donald Trump says he ordered the strike to prevent a conflict. His administration says Soleimani was plotting a series of attacks that endangered American troops and officials, without providing evidence. An official with the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq said it has scaled back operations and boosted “security and defensive measures” at bases hosting coalition forces in the country. The official spoke on condition of anonymity according to regulations. Washington has dispatched another 3,000 troops to neighboring Kuwait. MICHAEL PREGENT: TRUMP CONFRONTS IRAN WITH STRENGTH - OBAMA SHOWED WEAKNESS AND IRAN BECAME MORE DANGEROUS          Soleimani was the architect of Iran's regional policy of mobilizing militias across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, including in the war against the Islamic State group. He was also blamed for attacks on U.S. troops and American allies going back to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The mourners, mostly men in black military fatigues, carried Iraqi flags and the flags of Iran-backed militias that are fiercely loyal to Soleimani. They were also mourning Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a senior Iraqi militia commander who was killed in the same strike. SUSAN RICE SAYS OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 'DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY' TO KILL SOLEIMANI          The procession began at the Imam Kadhim shrine in Baghdad, one of the most revered sites in Shiite Islam. Mourners marched in the streets alongside militia vehicles in a solemn procession. The mourners, many of them in tears, chanted: \"No, No, America,\" and “Death to America, death to Israel.” Mohammed Fadl, a mourner dressed in black, said the funeral is an expression of loyalty to the slain leaders. “It is a painful strike, but it will not shake us,” he said. Two helicopters hovered over the procession, which was attended by Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and leaders of Iran-backed militias. The gates to Baghdad's Green Zone, which houses government offices and foreign embassies, including the U.S. Embassy, were closed. TUCKER CARLSON ON SOLEIMANI KILLING: 'THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF BAD PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD. WE CAN'T KILL THEM ALL'          Iraq, which is closely allied with both Washington and Tehran, condemned the airstrike that killed Soleimani and called it an attack on its national sovereignty. Parliament is to meet for an emergency session on Sunday, and the government has come under mounting pressure to expel the 5,200 American troops based in the country, who are there to help prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group. The U.S. has ordered all citizens to leave Iraq and closed its embassy in Baghdad, where Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters staged two days of violent protests earlier this week in which they breached the compound. The British government has warned travelers not to go anywhere in the country except for the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, and there only for trips considered essential. In its advisory, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the security situation “could deteriorate quickly.\" No one was hurt in the embassy protests, which came in response to U.S. airstrikes that killed 25 Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. said the strikes were in response to a rocket attack that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq, which Washington blamed on the militias. FORMER CIA DIRECTOR PREDICTS 'HIGH COST' FOR SOLEIMANI STRIKE: THERE WILL BE 'DEAD CIVILIAN AMERICANS'          Tensions between the U.S. and Iran have steadily intensified since Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal and restore crippling sanctions. The administration's “maximum pressure” campaign has led Iran to openly abandon commitments under the deal. The U.S. has also blamed Iran for a wave of increasingly provocative attacks in the region, including the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure in September that temporarily halved its production. Iran denied involvement in those attacks, but admitted to shooting down a U.S. surveillance drone in June that it said had strayed into its airspace. On Saturday, billboards appeared on major streets in Iran showing Soleimani and carrying the warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that “harsh revenge” awaits the US. Iranian state television also aired images of a ceremony honoring Soleimani at a mosque in the Shiite holy city of Qom, where a red flag was unfurled above the minarets. Red flags in Shiite tradition symbolize both blood spilled unjustly and serve as a call to avenge a person who is slain. US TO SEND 3,000 MORE TROOPS TO MIDDLE EAST FOLLOWING SOLEIMANI DEATH: OFFICIALS          Iranian President Hassan Rouhani visited Soleimani’s home in Tehran to express his condolences. “The Americans did not realize what a great mistake they made,” Rouhani said. “They will see the effects of this criminal act, not only today but for years to come.”          Global powers had warned Friday that the killing of Soleimani could spark a dangerous new escalation, with many calling for restraint. Iran’s state TV reported that Qatar’s foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, made an unplanned trip to Iran where he met with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. The Qatari diplomat was also set to meet with Rouhani. Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs, took to Twitter to reiterate the kingdom's call for \"self-restraint\" to avoid “unbearable consequences.”          Another Saudi official confirmed to The Associated Press that the U.S. did not give a heads-up to Saudi Arabia or its other Gulf allies before carrying out the strike that killed Soleimani. The official was not authorized to discuss security matters and so spoke on condition of anonymity. Illustrating Soleimani's regional reach, Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip, including the territory’s Hamas rulers, opened a mourning site for the slain general and dozens gathered to burn American and Israeli flags.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Iran has promised “harsh revenge.” Already, a series of rockets launched in Baghdad late Saturday fell inside or near the Green Zone, which houses government offices and foreign embassies, including the U.S. Embassy.          Trump wrote on Twitter afterward that the U.S. had already “targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp; the Iranian culture.”          Trump did not identify the targets but added that they would be “HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.”          After thousands in Baghdad on Saturday mourned Soleimani and others killed in the strike, authorities flew the general’s body to the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. An honor guard stood by early Sunday as mourners carried the flag-draped coffins of Soleimani and other Guard members off the tarmac.          Officials brought Soleimani’s body to Ahvaz, a city that was a focus of fighting during the bloody, 1980-88 war between Iraq and Iran in which the general slowly grew to prominence. After that war, Soleimani joined the Guard’s newly formed Quds, or Jersualem, Force, an expeditionary force that works with Iranian proxy forces in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.          Authorities also plan to take Soleimani’s body to Mashhad later Sunday, as well as Tehran and Qom on Monday for public mourning processions, then onto his hometown of Kerman for burial Tuesday.          Soleimani was the architect of Iran’s regional policy of mobilizing militias across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, including in the war against the Islamic State group. He was also blamed for attacks on U.S. troops and American allies going back decades.          Though it’s unclear how or when Iran may respond, any retaliation was likely to come after three days of mourning declared in both Iran and Iraq. All eyes were on Iraq, where America and Iran have competed for influence since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.          After the airstrike early Friday, the U.S.-led coalition has scaled back operations and boosted “security and defensive measures” at bases hosting coalition forces in Iraq, a coalition official said on condition of anonymity according to regulations.          Meanwhile, the U.S. has dispatched another 3,000 troops to neighboring Kuwait, the latest in a series of deployments in recent months as the standoff with Iran has worsened. Protesters held demonstrations in dozens of U.S. cities Saturday over Trump’s decisions to kill Soleimani and deploy more troops to the Mideast.          In a thinly veiled threat, one of the Iran-backed militia, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, or League of the Righteous, called on Iraqi security forces to stay at least a kilometer (0.6 miles) away from U.S. bases starting Sunday night. However, U.S. troops are invariably based in Iraqi military posts alongside local forces.          Iraq’s government, which is closely allied with Iran, condemned the airstrike that killed Soleimani, calling it an attack on its national sovereignty. Parliament is meeting for an emergency session Sunday, and the government has come under mounting pressure to expel the 5,200 American troops who are based in the country to help prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group.          The U.S. has ordered all citizens to leave Iraq and temporarily closed its embassy in Baghdad, where Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters staged two days of violent protests in which they breached the compound. Britain and France have warned their citizens to avoid or strictly limit travel in Iraq.          No one was hurt in the embassy protests, which came in response to U.S. airstrikes that killed 25 Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. blamed the militia for a rocket attack that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON — Planned attacks against American military, diplomatic and financial targets in Lebanon and Syria comprised the imminent threat cited by U.S. officials as the reason President Donald Trump ordered the killing of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, multiple U.S. officials said Friday.          \"When we start seeing extensive and very solid intelligence that [Soleimani] is plotting imminent attacks against the United States, the president as commander in chief has a duty to take decisive action,\" said a senior State Department official speaking on condition of anonymity. \"If we had not taken this action, and hundreds of Americans were dead, you would be asking me why didn't you take out Soleimani when you have the chance.\"          A senior U.S. defense official said the U.S. alerted the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat team to prepare to deploy to protect U.S. diplomatic facilities in Lebanon should they come under attack. Despite the fact the entire brigade was put on alert, the official said the most likely deployment would be a rifle company or a battalion, somewhere between 130 to 750 total troops.          Targets in Syria that were under imminent threat included military outposts the U.S. maintains in the eastern part of the country, current and former officials said. In Lebanon, Soleimani was allegedly planning attacks on diplomatic and financial targets, they said.          \"He was actively plotting in the region to take actions — big action as he described it - that would have put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview on CNN. A U.S. drone strike that killed Soleimani Thursday in Baghdad stopped an \"imminent attack\" against Americans that Soleimani was actively working to implement, Pompeo said.          A senior U.S. official said recently Soleimani traveled to Syria, Lebanon and then to Iraq Thursday, and U.S. intelligence officials believe he was approving final plans for attacks in each location.          Administration officials were expected to brief lawmakers on the operation. So far the administration has declined to provide details publicly of the intelligence assessment that prompted the strike against Soleimani.          Members of Congress have expressed concern about retaliation from Iran, which its leadership has said it will take. Democrats in particular have expressed concern that Trump's authorization of a strike against Soleimani will escalate to a full-blown war with Iran, and they've demanded details of the \"imminent\" threat.          The National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</td>\n",

Qassem Soleimani its highest military honor on Monday while Iranian student protesters took to the streets to tear down posters set up in his memory. Soleimani was killed in a U.S. airstrike outside Iraq’s Baghdad International Airport on Jan. 2.          Syrian Prime Minister Imad Khamis announced that President Bashar Assad had awarded Soleimani the medal while meeting with Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri in Tehran. “Awarding this medal reveals the Syrian president’s deep affection for Gen. Soleimani and for his brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Khamis said, according to Iran’s Tasnim News.          The medal was not named in the news article but was described as Syria's \"top medal of honor.\"          Meanwhile, protesters walked the streets of Iran, chanting anti-government statements and claiming Soleimani was no hero.          \"Soleimani was a murderer, his leader is, too,\" protesters chanted, referring to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.                               The posthumous award from Syria was predictable, one Iran-watcher said.          “No surprise that an Iranian client state would do this, and no surprise of course that Assad would do it,” former intelligence officer Michael Pregent told the medianame. Giving Soleimani the award is “slapping the face” of the hundreds of thousands of people who have died in the Syrian civil war, Pregent said.                               As head of Iran's Quds Force, Soleimani directed covert operations across the Middle East. More than 600 U.S. troops died due to Iranian support of insurgents in Iraq, according to the Department of Defense. Additionally, Iran is credited with helping save Assad, a key ally, by providing troops, weapons, and training to his regime as it continues to fight a civil war.\n",

The death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a United States airstrike in Baghdad on Thursday will likely unite Iran and its allies in mourning the man some considered to be Tehran's second most powerful leader. But little is known outside the Middle East about the man who played such a key role in shaping conflicts across the region. The 62-year-old led the elite Quds Force, part of Iran's Revolutionary Guards that also reports to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Soleimani was also accused of controlling proxy militias across the Middle East including ones in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. He has been characterized as a murderer by many U.S. government officials, ranging from President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Announcing his death, the Pentagon blamed Soleimani for orchestrating a series of attacks on allied bases in Iraq in recent months, most recently a rocket strike last week that killed a U.S. contractor and wounded four other service members. That killing prompted the U.S. to conduct five airstrikes across Iraq and Syria, targeting an Iranian-backed militia group it said was responsible for the attack. In turn, those bombings saw hundreds of the militia's supporters storm the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad. The Pentagon also said Soleimani had been actively developing plans to attack U.S. diplomats and service members in Iraq and elsewhere throughout the region. On Friday, Khamenei called Soleimani a martyr and declared a three-day national mourning period for him and other senior officials killed in the airstrike. \"He was a stellar example of those educated and nurtured in Islam,\" Khamenei said in a statement Friday that also called for \"severe revenge.\" Soleimani led the Quds, which is designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. and was considered the most powerful intelligence operative in the Middle East, for more than two decades. He was behind the seizure of the Iraqi oil-rich city of Kirkuk from American-allied Kurdish forces in 2017. He helped negotiate for the Iraqi government and Shiite militias to take the city largely uncontested. It was viewed as an embarrassing strategic blow to the U.S. at the time. But Soleimani is also credited with fighting the Islamic State militant group in Iraq. In a 2017 public letter, he denounced the \"evil movement\" that managed \"to deceive tens of thousands of Muslim youth\" in Iraq and Syria, while also blaming the U.S. for the rise and spread of ISIS. Iran had launched airstrikes against ISIS fighters outside Baghdad in late 2014 just as the United States and its coalition partners were taking on the extremist group. ISIS, made up of Sunni extremists, was ideologically at odds with Soleimani and the Iranian Shiite regime he defended. Soleimani and his commanders were on the front lines in Iraq and his name became synonymous with victories attributed to Iraqi ground forces. He had presented himself as the face of the offensive in Tikrit, a city which fell under ISIS control in 2014. Iran sought to highlight his efforts against ISIS while protesting his death Friday. Zarif said the slain general had dedicated his life \"to fighting tyranny, oppression, terror and extremism.\" Reported to have been raised in poverty in the mountains of eastern Iran, Soleimani went from being a construction worker to climbing the ranks of Iran's military as a young man following the Islamic Revolution of 1979. He became known as a war hero and a patriot, risking his life to minimize casualties among his men in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, according to a 2011 American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research report. His track record includes support of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The United Nations had imposed an asset freeze and travel ban on him in 2007, and the U.S. sanctioned him again in response to his alleged involvement in the Syrian war in 2011. Long known as the \"shadow commander\" in Western media, his profile was raised in 2015 as Iranian outlets began releasing photos of him in the battlefield guiding the war against ISIS. His face was soon plastered on T-shirts and his name mentioned in Shiite music videos. His power was compared to that of a vice president.\n",
       "189  Soleimani funeral procession in Baghdad draws thousands of mourners chanting 'America is the Great Satan'  BAGHDAD (AP) — Thousands of mourners chanting “America is the Great Satan” marched in a funeral procession Saturday through Baghdad for Iran's top general and Iraqi militant leaders, who were killed in a U.S. airstrike. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds force and mastermind of its regional security strategy, was killed in an airstrike early Friday near the Iraqi capital's international airport that has caused regional tensions to soar. Iran has vowed harsh retaliation, raising fears of an all-outwar. U.S. President Donald Trump says he ordered the strike to prevent a conflict. His administration says Soleimani was plotting a series of attacks that endangered American troops and officials, without providing evidence. An official with the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq said it has scaled back operations and boosted “security and defensive measures” at bases hosting coalition forces in the country. The official spoke on condition of anonymity according to regulations. Washington has dispatched another 3,000 troops to neighboring Kuwait. MICHAEL PREGENT: TRUMP CONFRONTS IRAN WITH STRENGTH - OBAMA SHOWED WEAKNESS AND IRAN BECAME MORE DANGEROUS          Soleimani was the architect of Iran's regional policy of mobilizing militias across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, including in the war against the Islamic State group. He was also blamed for attacks on U.S. troops and American allies going back to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The mourners, mostly men in black military fatigues, carried Iraqi flags and the flags of Iran-backed militias that are fiercely loyal to Soleimani. They were also mourning Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a senior Iraqi militia commander who was killed in the same strike. SUSAN RICE SAYS OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 'DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY' TO KILL SOLEIMANI          The procession began at the Imam Kadhim shrine in Baghdad, one of the most revered sites in Shiite Islam. Mourners marched in the streets alongside militia vehicles in a solemn procession. The mourners, many of them in tears, chanted: \"No, No, America,\" and “Death to America, death to Israel.” Mohammed Fadl, a mourner dressed in black, said the funeral is an expression of loyalty to the slain leaders. “It is a painful strike, but it will not shake us,” he said. Two helicopters hovered over the procession, which was attended by Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and leaders of Iran-backed militias. The gates to Baghdad's Green Zone, which houses government offices and foreign embassies, including the U.S. Embassy, were closed. TUCKER CARLSON ON SOLEIMANI KILLING: 'THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF BAD PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD. WE CAN'T KILL THEM ALL'          Iraq, which is closely allied with both Washington and Tehran, condemned the airstrike that killed Soleimani and called it an attack on its national sovereignty. Parliament is to meet for an emergency session on Sunday, and the government has come under mounting pressure to expel the 5,200 American troops based in the country, who are there to help prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group. The U.S. has ordered all citizens to leave Iraq and closed its embassy in Baghdad, where Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters staged two days of violent protests earlier this week in which they breached the compound. The British government has warned travelers not to go anywhere in the country except for the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, and there only for trips considered essential. In its advisory, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the security situation “could deteriorate quickly.\" No one was hurt in the embassy protests, which came in response to U.S. airstrikes that killed 25 Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. said the strikes were in response to a rocket attack that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq, which Washington blamed on the militias. FORMER CIA DIRECTOR PREDICTS 'HIGH COST' FOR SOLEIMANI STRIKE: THERE WILL BE 'DEAD CIVILIAN AMERICANS'          Tensions between the U.S. and Iran have steadily intensified since Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal and restore crippling sanctions. The administration's “maximum pressure” campaign has led Iran to openly abandon commitments under the deal. The U.S. has also blamed Iran for a wave of increasingly provocative attacks in the region, including the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure in September that temporarily halved its production. Iran denied involvement in those attacks, but admitted to shooting down a U.S. surveillance drone in June that it said had strayed into its airspace. On Saturday, billboards appeared on major streets in Iran showing Soleimani and carrying the warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that “harsh revenge” awaits the US. Iranian state television also aired images of a ceremony honoring Soleimani at a mosque in the Shiite holy city of Qom, where a red flag was unfurled above the minarets. Red flags in Shiite tradition symbolize both blood spilled unjustly and serve as a call to avenge a person who is slain. US TO SEND 3,000 MORE TROOPS TO MIDDLE EAST FOLLOWING SOLEIMANI DEATH: OFFICIALS          Iranian President Hassan Rouhani visited Soleimani’s home in Tehran to express his condolences. “The Americans did not realize what a great mistake they made,” Rouhani said. “They will see the effects of this criminal act, not only today but for years to come.”          Global powers had warned Friday that the killing of Soleimani could spark a dangerous new escalation, with many calling for restraint. Iran’s state TV reported that Qatar’s foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, made an unplanned trip to Iran where he met with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. The Qatari diplomat was also set to meet with Rouhani. Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs, took to Twitter to reiterate the kingdom's call for \"self-restraint\" to avoid “unbearable consequences.”          Another Saudi official confirmed to The Associated Press that the U.S. did not give a heads-up to Saudi Arabia or its other Gulf allies before carrying out the strike that killed Soleimani. The official was not authorized to discuss security matters and so spoke on condition of anonymity. Illustrating Soleimani's regional reach, Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip, including the territory’s Hamas rulers, opened a mourning site for the slain general and dozens gathered to burn American and Israeli flags.\n",

Trump wrote on Twitter afterward that the U.S. had already “targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture.”          Trump did not identify the targets but added that they would be “HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.”          After thousands in Baghdad on Saturday mourned Soleimani and others killed in the strike, authorities flew the general’s body to the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. An honor guard stood by early Sunday as mourners carried the flag-draped coffins of Soleimani and other Guard members off the tarmac.          Officials brought Soleimani’s body to Ahvaz, a city that was a focus of fighting during the bloody, 1980-88 war between Iraq and Iran in which the general slowly grew to prominence. After that war, Soleimani joined the Guard’s newly formed Quds, or Jersualem, Force, an expeditionary force that works with Iranian proxy forces in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.          Authorities also plan to take Soleimani’s body to Mashhad later Sunday, as well as Tehran and Qom on Monday for public mourning processions, then onto his hometown of Kerman for burial Tuesday.          Soleimani was the architect of Iran’s regional policy of mobilizing militias across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, including in the war against the Islamic State group. He was also blamed for attacks on U.S. troops and American allies going back decades.          Though it’s unclear how or when Iran may respond, any retaliation was likely to come after three days of mourning declared in both Iran and Iraq. All eyes were on Iraq, where America and Iran have competed for influence since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.          After the airstrike early Friday, the U.S.-led coalition has scaled back operations and boosted “security and defensive measures” at bases hosting coalition forces in Iraq, a coalition official said on condition of anonymity according to regulations.          Meanwhile, the U.S. has dispatched another 3,000 troops to neighboring Kuwait, the latest in a series of deployments in recent months as the standoff with Iran has worsened. Protesters held demonstrations in dozens of U.S. cities Saturday over Trump’s decisions to kill Soleimani and deploy more troops to the Mideast.          In a thinly veiled threat, one of the Iran-backed militia, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, or League of the Righteous, called on Iraqi security forces to stay at least a kilometer (0.6 miles) away from U.S. bases starting Sunday night. However, U.S. troops are invariably based in Iraqi military posts alongside local forces.          Iraq’s government, which is closely allied with Iran, condemned the airstrike that killed Soleimani, calling it an attack on its national sovereignty. Parliament is meeting for an emergency session Sunday, and the government has come under mounting pressure to expel the 5,200 American troops who are based in the country to help prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group.          The U.S. has ordered all citizens to leave Iraq and temporarily closed its embassy in Baghdad, where Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters staged two days of violent protests in which they breached the compound. Britain and France have warned their citizens to avoid or strictly limit travel in Iraq.          No one was hurt in the embassy protests, which came in response to U.S. airstrikes that killed 25 Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. blamed the militia for a rocket attack that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq.\n",

Despite the fact the entire brigade was put on alert, the official said the most likely deployment would be a rifle company or a battalion, somewhere between 130 to 750 total troops.          Targets in Syria that were under imminent threat included military outposts the U.S. maintains in the eastern part of the country, current and former officials said. In Lebanon, Soleimani was allegedly planning attacks on diplomatic and financial targets, they said.          \"He was actively plotting in the region to take actions — big action as he described it - that would have put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview on CNN. A U.S. drone strike that killed Soleimani Thursday in Baghdad stopped an \"imminent attack\" against Americans that Soleimani was actively working to implement, Pompeo said.          A senior U.S. official said recently Soleimani traveled to Syria, Lebanon and then to Iraq Thursday, and U.S. intelligence officials believe he was approving final plans for attacks in each location.          Administration officials were expected to brief lawmakers on the operation. So far the administration has declined to provide details publicly of the intelligence assessment that prompted the strike against Soleimani.          Members of Congress have expressed concern about retaliation from Iran, which its leadership has said it will take. Democrats in particular have expressed concern that Trump's authorization of a strike against Soleimani will escalate to a full-blown war with Iran, and they've demanded details of the \"imminent\" threat.          The National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

       "      <td>Iran-Backed Milin Withdraw From U.S. Embassy in Baghdad</td>\n",
       "      <td>(BAGHDAD) — Iran-backed militiamen withdrew from the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Wednesday after two days of clashes with American security forces, but U.S.-Iran tensions remain high and could spill over into further violence.          The withdrawal followed calls from the government and senior militia leaders. It ended a two-day crisis marked by the breach of the largest and one of the most heavily fortified U.S. diplomatic missions in the world.          The attack and its volatile aftermath prompted the Pentagon to send hundreds of additional troops to the Middle East and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to delay a European and Central Asian trip.          In an orchestrated assault, hundreds of militiamen and their supporters broke into the embassy compound, destroying a reception area, smashing windows and spraying graffiti on walls to protest U.S. airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia over the weekend that killed 25 fighters.          The U.S. blamed the militia for a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base in the northern city of Kirkuk last week that killed a U.S. contractor.          The protesters set up a tent camp overnight and on Wednesday set fire to the reception area and hurled stones at U.S. Marines guarding the compound, who responded with tear gas. There were no injuries on either side and no American staff were evacuated from the compound.          The Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of state-allied militias — many backed by Iran — called on its supporters to withdraw in response to an appeal by the Iraqi government, saying “your message has been received.”          By late afternoon the tents had been taken down and the protesters relocated to the opposite side of the Tigris River, outside the so-called Green Zone housing government offices and foreign embassies. U.S. Apache helicopters circled overhead.          “After achieving the intended aim, we pulled out from this place triumphantly,” said Fadhil al-Gezzi, a militia supporter. “We rubbed America’s nose in the dirt.” Trump has vowed to exact a “big price” for an attack he blamed squarely on Iran.          Kataeb Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia targeted by the U.S. airstrikes, initially refused to leave but later bowed to demands to disperse. The militia is separate from the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, though both are backed by Iran.          “We don’t care about these planes that are flying over the heads of the picketers. Neither do we care about the news that America will bring Marines,” said Mohammed Mohy, a spokesman for Kataeb Hezbollah. “On the contrary, this shows a psychological defeat and a big mental breakdown that the American administration is suffering from,” he said, before withdrawing from the area.          The violence came as Iran and its allies across the region have faced unprecedented mass protests in recent months and heavy U.S. sanctions have cratered Iran’s economy.          Iraq has been gripped by anti-government protests since October fueled by anger at widespread corruption and economic mismanagement, as well as Iran’s heavy influence over the country’s affairs. Those protesters were not involved in the embassy attack.          The Pentagon sent an infantry battalion of about 750 soldiers to the Middle East. A U.S. official familiar with the decision said they would go to Kuwait. Pompeo postponed a trip that was scheduled to start in Ukraine late Thursday so that he can monitor developments in Iraq and “ensure the safety and security of Americans in the Middle East,” said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus.          Iran denied involvement in the attack on the embassy. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted by media as saying that “if the Islamic Republic makes a decision to confront any country, it will do it directly.”          Iran later summoned the Swiss charge d’affaires, who represents American interests in Tehran, to protest what it said was war-mongering by U.S. officials.          Public consular operations at the embassy were suspended and future appointments cancelled, it said in a statement.          Tensions have steadily risen since Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and embarked on a campaign of maximum pressure through economic sanctions. Iran has responded by abandoning some of its commitments under the deal.          U.S. officials have blamed Iran for the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in September that caused a spike in world oil prices. But the Trump administration has not responded with direct military action, apparently fearing a wider conflict.          The U.S. has sent more than 14,000 additional troops to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression. At the time of the attack, the U.S. had about 5,200 troops in Iraq, mainly to train Iraqi forces and help them combat Islamic State extremists.          The U.S. and Iran have vied for influence over Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Iran has close ties to Iraq’s Shiite majority and major political factions, and its influence has steadily grown since then.          Iran helped to mobilize tens of thousands of mostly Shiite militiamen to battle the Islamic State group when it stormed across northern and western Iraq in 2014 as the armed forces collapsed. The U.S. and Iran both provided vital aid to Iraqi forces, who eventually declared victory over the extremists in December 2017.          The political influence of the Popular Mobilization Forces has risen in recent years, and their allies dominate the parliament and the government. That has made them the target of the anti-government protesters, who have attacked Iranian diplomatic missions and the local headquarters of parties affiliated with the militias across southern Iraq.          They have also set up a sprawling protest camp in central Baghdad, and for weeks have been trying to enter the Green Zone. Iraqi security forces have beaten them back with tear gas and live ammunition, killing hundreds.          The militiamen and their supporters, however, were able to quickly enter the Green Zone and mass in front of the embassy, with little if any resistance from authorities.          Iraq’s government vehemently condemned the airstrikes on the militia, saying it violated national sovereignty. But Iran and its allies might have also seen the attack as a way of diverting attention from the anti-government protests.          “Iran has been trying to provoke the U.S. into helping it solve its Iraq problem,” said the Crisis Group, an international think tank. “The Trump administration, by responding to the attacks in Kirkuk and elsewhere with airstrikes, has obliged.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>American military forces arrived on scene at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, on Tuesday to stop a terrorist attack against the embassy that was being carried out by thousands of attackers.          President Donald Trump announced that Iran would be held “fully responsible” for any lives lost or damage to the facility and that they would pay “a very big price.”          “The U.S. Embassy in Iraq is, &amp; has been for hours, SAFE! Many of our great Warfighters, together with the most lethal military equipment in the world, was immediately rushed to the site,” Trump tweeted. “Thank you to the President &amp; Prime Minister of Iraq for their rapid response upon request Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!”          Dan Scavino Jr, Assistant to President Trump, tweeted out a video of the Marines loading up their weapons and deploying to the embassy.          Myles B. Caggins III, official military Spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), tweeted out a video of AH-64 Apache helicopters arriving at the embassy to provide backup support.          Democrats and far-left media pundits politicized the terrorist attack to attack Trump and suggest that the attack was Trump’s Benghazi, however, critics quickly fired back at the claims.          Democrat Senator Chris Murphy (CT) tweeted: “The attack on our embassy in Baghdad is horrifying but predictable. Trump has rendered America impotent in the Middle East. No one fears us, no one listens to us. America has been reduced to huddling in safe rooms, hoping the bad guys will go away. What a disgrace.”          Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) responded: “Because ISIS &amp; others feared the US under Pres Obama right? The victims in Benghazi btw never safely made it out of a safe room &amp; the bad guys did get away. The amt of Dems spending New Years Eve rooting &amp; working against America just bc of hate for POTUS is the disgrace!”          Radio host Dale Jackson noted: “Reading these comments about the situation in #Iraq and it is clear that the media and their Democrats wanted a straight up Benghazi disaster. Odd, considering they claimed what happened at Benghazi was no big deal.

       "      <td>A proxy war between the US and Iran just moved a step closer</td>\n",
       "      <td>(medianame) For the Iraqi government, it's the stuff of nightmares: A proxy war between the United States and Iran in a country already wracked by protests, crippled by political paralysis and threatened by renewed terrorism. But that war has come a step nearer with Sunday's US airstrikes against a pro-Iranian militia in Iraq .          The target of the US airstrikes is a group called Kataib Hezbollah, one of the most radical Shia militia in Iraq, with close links to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. US officials hold it responsible for a growing number of rocket attacks against US facilities in Iraq. The death of a US contractor in one such attack last week was the last straw for the Trump administration.          On Monday, Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani, Iraq's pre-eminent Shia cleric, demanded action from the government \"so as not to make Iraq an arena for settling regional and international accounts.\" But that settling is now gathering pace.          Fighters from the Kataib Hezbollah militia, inspect damage in the aftermath of a US airstrike in Qaim, Iraq.          Kataib Hezbollah is militantly anti-American. In 2017 and 2018, its fighters in Syria tried to attack the US-supported garrison at al-Tanf on the Iraqi border. Earlier this month it boasted of the failure of the \"Saudi-American-Zionist axis of evil.\"          It has provided hundreds of fighters for the Assad regime in Syria -- part of a broader Iranian effort to help stamp out the insurgency there -- and is an important element in Iranian efforts to extend its influence through northern Iraq and into Syria. The US strikes, notably, were against targets along the main route between Iran and Syria.          In recent months, Kataib Hezbollah has stepped up attacks on US facilities in Iraq in line with Iran's wider campaign of resistance against the re-imposition of sanctions by the US. To start with, these attacks were no more than irritants -- most of the rockets fell harmlessly some distance from US forces. But the range and potency of the attacks has grown, and they've become more accurate. In one attack in November, 17 rockets were fired on a base south of Mosul.          For the Iraqi government, the face-off between the US and pro-Iranian militia adds another source of instability in a country already deep in crisis. Roiling popular protests since October have pitted young Iraqis fed up with corruption and the lack of opportunity against the security forces and militia like Kata'ib who are accused of some of the harshest actions against demonstrators. The US has already sanctioned a leading Kataib Hezbollah official for human rights abuses.At least 485 people have been killed since protests erupted and at least 27,000 people have been injured, according to the Independent High Commission for Human Rights of Iraq.          The unrest has further weakened an already fragile economy and has triggered a political meltdown. Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi has resigned but no consensus candidate has yet emerged to replace him. Two constitutional deadlines to nominate a successor have come and gone.          In many places, the protests have taken on an anti-Iranian flavour, with the Iranian consulate in the city of Najaf torched last month.          Iraqi President Barham Salih, a Kurd, last week threatened to quit \"to avoid more bloodshed and in order to safeguard civil peace\" rather than approve a candidate for Prime Minister seen as pro-Iranian. Thousands of protestors, who are demanding fresh elections and an end to the domination of existing political blocs, took to the streets in support of Salih's stand.          But Iran has invested heavily in deepening its influence in an arc from Iraq through Syria to Lebanon and will not give up its strategic gains without a fight, even as US sanctions make its expansionism difficult to afford.          The political deadlock in Baghdad is beginning to look like a struggle between pro-Iranian Shia groups and Iraqi nationalists. And the airstrikes will embolden the pro-Iranian blocs in parliament to push again for the expulsion of US forces from Iraq.          The last time they left, at the end of 2011, ISIS took full advantage. The remnants of the group may now be savoring a new opportunity. They have been regrouping underground in provinces north of Baghdad. There has been a steady uptick in ambushes, bomb attacks and assassinations claimed by the group in the latter half of this year.          A proxy war between US forces and pro-Iranian groups that are notionally tied into the Iraqi military would make counter-terrorism operations -- the very reason the US still has 5,000 troops in Iraq -- more difficult.          The rhetoric suggests the US airstrikes will not go unanswered. Iran has said the US \"must accept responsibility of the consequences of the illegal attacks.\" Kataib Hezbollah called for \"a new phase of pride and honor, a phase to drive the brutal American enemy out of our holy land.\"          In November the senior US military commander in the region, Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, said Iran was trying to \"crack the campaign\" of US sanctions through attacks designed to provoke an American military response. If that's the case, Tehran may have succeeded.</td>\n",

       "      <td>US troops knew Al-Asad air base would be attacked and sheltered in bunkers, exclusive tour reveals</td>\n",
       "      <td>Most troops were either flown out of the base or sheltering in bunkers by 11:00 p.m. local time Tuesday -- shortly before the first of four volleys of missiles began at just after 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday, officers said during the first tour by journalists of the air base.          The attack lasted around two hours, only targeting the US areas of the air base, which comprise around a quarter of the Iraqi base.          Officers called it a \"miracle\" that there were no casualties at the blasted site, with missiles landing just a few meters from bunkers, and some essential personnel remaining outside throughout.          It is the first time troops at the base have spoken in detail of the moments before the attack, revealing that they were able to seek shelter in bunkers shortly before missiles struck.          US troops knew there was going to be an attack on their base -- they just didn't know what the nature of the attack would be. The ruined remains of the living quarters where soldiers were evacuated. The Iranian attack on the Al-Asad airbase was one of two on Iraqi military bases housing US troops on Wednesday. The attacks were in retaliation for a drone strike at a Baghdad airport that killed Iran's most powerful military commander, Qasem Soleimani, earlier in the week. President Donald Trump said Soleimani was plotting \"imminent and sinister attacks\" on Americans, though he has been unable to offer a time frame on when this would be. Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi previously said Iran sent Iraq an official verbal message that an attack \"had begun or would begin shortly,\" on unspecified US military locations. An Arab diplomatic source also told medianame that Iraq gave advance warning to the US on \"which bases would be hit\" after Iranian officials passed on the information. Lt. Col. Staci Colemsan said it was a \"miracle\" there were no casualties. The first strike hit at 1:34 a.m. and after a brief pause of around 15 minutes, the next volley began. Two more volleys of missiles followed over the next two hours. At dawn, officers finally emerged from bunkers to discover the full scale of destruction. The Al-Asad air base, which houses US troops, is one of the largest and oldest military bases in Iraq. It is located in Anbar province, a hotbed of ISIS activity in western Iraq between 2014 and 2017. Anbar was the birthplace of Sunni extremism in the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. In December 2018, Trump visited troops at Al-Asad. \"We came in, we felt very safe coming in. It was a pretty difficult journey in certain ways, but we felt very, very good, very safe,\" Trump said, according to a White House transcript. Vice President Mike Pence visited the base a year later to celebrate Thanksgiving with around 150 service members. The US military presence in Iraq has fluctuated greatly since the 2003 invasion. At its height, the US had 170,000 troops in Iraq. In 2011, former President Barack Obama withdrew US forces from the country. Around 5,000 troops were deployed to Iraq in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government, seeking US assistance in the fight against ISIS. Troop levels have been roughly the same since.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Iraq's new government of national unity will not stop the deterioration. Iraqis have had three such governments in the last three years, each with Sunnis in key posts, without noticeable effect. The alternative path out of this terrible trap has five elements.          The first is to establish three largely autonomous regions with a viable central government in Baghdad. The Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws, administration and internal security. The central government would control border defense, foreign affairs and oil revenues. Baghdad would become a federal zone, while densely populated areas of mixed populations would receive both multisectarian and international police protection.          Decentralization is hardly as radical as it may seem: the Iraqi Constitution, in fact, already provides for a federal structure and a procedure for provinces to combine into regional governments.          Besides, things are already heading toward partition: increasingly, each community supports federalism, if only as a last resort. The Sunnis, who until recently believed they would retake power in Iraq, are beginning to recognize that they won't and don't want to live in a Shiite-controlled, highly centralized state with laws enforced by sectarian militias. The Shiites know they can dominate the government, but they can't defeat a Sunni insurrection. The Kurds will not give up their 15-year-old autonomy.          Some will say moving toward strong regionalism would ignite sectarian cleansing. But that's exactly what is going on already, in ever-bigger waves. Others will argue that it would lead to partition. But a breakup is already under way. As it was in Bosnia, a strong federal system is a viable means to prevent both perils in Iraq.          The second element would be to entice the Sunnis into joining the federal system with an offer they couldn't refuse. To begin with, running their own region should be far preferable to the alternatives: being dominated by Kurds and Shiites in a central government or being the main victims of a civil war. But they also have to be given money to make their oil-poor region viable. The Constitution must be amended to guarantee Sunni areas 20 percent (approximately their proportion of the population) of all revenues.          The third component would be to ensure the protection of the rights of women and ethno-religious minorities by increasing American aid to Iraq but tying it to respect for those rights. Such protections will be difficult, especially in the Shiite-controlled south, but Washington has to be clear that widespread violations will stop the cash flow.          Fourth, the president must direct the military to design a plan for withdrawing and redeploying our troops from Iraq by 2008 (while providing for a small but effective residual force to combat terrorists and keep the neighbors honest). We must avoid a precipitous withdrawal that would lead to a national meltdown , but we also can't have a substantial long-term American military presence. That would do terrible damage to our armed forces, break American and Iraqi public support for the mission and leave Iraqis without any incentive to shape up.          Fifth, under an international or United Nations umbrella, we should convene a regional conference to pledge respect for Iraq's borders and its federal system. For all that Iraq's neighbors might gain by picking at its pieces, each faces the greater danger of a regional war. A \"contact group\" of major powers would be set up to lean on neighbors to comply with the deal.          Mr. Bush has spent three years in a futile effort to establish a strong central government in Baghdad, leaving us without a real political settlement, with a deteriorating security situation — and with nothing but the most difficult policy choices. The five-point alternative plan offers a plausible path to that core political settlement among Iraqis, along with the economic, military and diplomatic levers to make the political solution work. It is also a plausible way for Democrats and Republicans alike to protect our basic security interests and honor our country's sacrifices.</td>\n",

       "172                                              Iran-Backed Milin Withdraw From U.S. Embassy in Baghdad  (BAGHDAD) — Iran-backed militiamen withdrew from the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Wednesday after two days of clashes with American security forces, but U.S.-Iran tensions remain high and could spill over into further violence.          The withdrawal followed calls from the government and senior militia leaders. It ended a two-day crisis marked by the breach of the largest and one of the most heavily fortified U.S. diplomatic missions in the world.          The attack and its volatile aftermath prompted the Pentagon to send hundreds of additional troops to the Middle East and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to delay a European and Central Asian trip.          In an orchestrated assault, hundreds of militiamen and their supporters broke into the embassy compound, destroying a reception area, smashing windows and spraying graffiti on walls to protest U.S. airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia over the weekend that killed 25 fighters.          The U.S. blamed the militia for a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base in the northern city of Kirkuk last week that killed a U.S. contractor.          The protesters set up a tent camp overnight and on Wednesday set fire to the reception area and hurled stones at U.S. Marines guarding the compound, who responded with tear gas. There were no injuries on either side and no American staff were evacuated from the compound.          The Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of state-allied militias — many backed by Iran — called on its supporters to withdraw in response to an appeal by the Iraqi government, saying “your message has been received.”          By late afternoon the tents had been taken down and the protesters relocated to the opposite side of the Tigris River, outside the so-called Green Zone housing government offices and foreign embassies. U.S. Apache helicopters circled overhead.          “After achieving the intended aim, we pulled out from this place triumphantly,” said Fadhil al-Gezzi, a militia supporter. “We rubbed America’s nose in the dirt.” Trump has vowed to exact a “big price” for an attack he blamed squarely on Iran.          Kataeb Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia targeted by the U.S. airstrikes, initially refused to leave but later bowed to demands to disperse. The militia is separate from the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, though both are backed by Iran.          “We don’t care about these planes that are flying over the heads of the picketers. Neither do we care about the news that America will bring Marines,” said Mohammed Mohy, a spokesman for Kataeb Hezbollah. “On the contrary, this shows a psychological defeat and a big mental breakdown that the American administration is suffering from,” he said, before withdrawing from the area.          The violence came as Iran and its allies across the region have faced unprecedented mass protests in recent months and heavy U.S. sanctions have cratered Iran’s economy.          Iraq has been gripped by anti-government protests since October fueled by anger at widespread corruption and economic mismanagement, as well as Iran’s heavy influence over the country’s affairs. Those protesters were not involved in the embassy attack.          The Pentagon sent an infantry battalion of about 750 soldiers to the Middle East. A U.S. official familiar with the decision said they would go to Kuwait. Pompeo postponed a trip that was scheduled to start in Ukraine late Thursday so that he can monitor developments in Iraq and “ensure the safety and security of Americans in the Middle East,” said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus.          Iran denied involvement in the attack on the embassy. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted by media as saying that “if the Islamic Republic makes a decision to confront any country, it will do it directly.”          Iran later summoned the Swiss charge d’affaires, who represents American interests in Tehran, to protest what it said was war-mongering by U.S. officials.          Public consular operations at the embassy were suspended and future appointments cancelled, it said in a statement.          Tensions have steadily risen since Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and embarked on a campaign of maximum pressure through economic sanctions. Iran has responded by abandoning some of its commitments under the deal.          U.S. officials have blamed Iran for the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in September that caused a spike in world oil prices. But the Trump administration has not responded with direct military action, apparently fearing a wider conflict.          The U.S. has sent more than 14,000 additional troops to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression. At the time of the attack, the U.S. had about 5,200 troops in Iraq, mainly to train Iraqi forces and help them combat Islamic State extremists.          The U.S. and Iran have vied for influence over Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Iran has close ties to Iraq’s Shiite majority and major political factions, and its influence has steadily grown since then.          Iran helped to mobilize tens of thousands of mostly Shiite militiamen to battle the Islamic State group when it stormed across northern and western Iraq in 2014 as the armed forces collapsed. The U.S. and Iran both provided vital aid to Iraqi forces, who eventually declared victory over the extremists in December 2017.          The political influence of the Popular Mobilization Forces has risen in recent years, and their allies dominate the parliament and the government. That has made them the target of the anti-government protesters, who have attacked Iranian diplomatic missions and the local headquarters of parties affiliated with the militias across southern Iraq.          They have also set up a sprawling protest camp in central Baghdad, and for weeks have been trying to enter the Green Zone. Iraqi security forces have beaten them back with tear gas and live ammunition, killing hundreds.          The militiamen and their supporters, however, were able to quickly enter the Green Zone and mass in front of the embassy, with little if any resistance from authorities.          Iraq’s government vehemently condemned the airstrikes on the militia, saying it violated national sovereignty. But Iran and its allies might have also seen the attack as a way of diverting attention from the anti-government protests.          “Iran has been trying to provoke the U.S. into helping it solve its Iraq problem,” said the Crisis Group, an international think tank. “The Trump administration, by responding to the attacks in Kirkuk and elsewhere with airstrikes, has obliged.”\n",

President Donald Trump announced that Iran would be held “fully responsible” for any lives lost or damage to the facility and that they would pay “a very big price.”          “The U.S. Embassy in Iraq is, & has been for hours, SAFE! Many of our great Warfighters, together with the most lethal military equipment in the world, was immediately rushed to the site,” Trump tweeted. “Thank you to the President & Prime Minister of Iraq for their rapid response upon request Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!”          Dan Scavino Jr, Assistant to President Trump, tweeted out a video of the Marines loading up their weapons and deploying to the embassy.          Myles B. Caggins III, official military Spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), tweeted out a video of AH-64 Apache helicopters arriving at the embassy to provide backup support.          Democrats and far-left media pundits politicized the terrorist attack to attack Trump and suggest that the attack was Trump’s Benghazi, however, critics quickly fired back at the claims.          Democrat Senator Chris Murphy (CT) tweeted: “The attack on our embassy in Baghdad is horrifying but predictable. Trump has rendered America impotent in the Middle East. No one fears us, no one listens to us. America has been reduced to huddling in safe rooms, hoping the bad guys will go away. What a disgrace.”          Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) responded: “Because ISIS & others feared the US under Pres Obama right? The victims in Benghazi btw never safely made it out of a safe room & the bad guys did get away. The amt of Dems spending New Years Eve rooting & working against America just bc of hate for POTUS is the disgrace!”          Radio host Dale Jackson noted: “Reading these comments about the situation in #Iraq and it is clear that the media and their Democrats wanted a straight up Benghazi disaster. Odd, considering they claimed what happened at Benghazi was no big deal. This is who they are, they are telling you, believe them.”          This is a developing news story, refresh the page for updates.\n",

But that war has come a step nearer with Sunday's US airstrikes against a pro-Iranian militia in Iraq .          The target of the US airstrikes is a group called Kataib Hezbollah, one of the most radical Shia militia in Iraq, with close links to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. US officials hold it responsible for a growing number of rocket attacks against US facilities in Iraq. The death of a US contractor in one such attack last week was the last straw for the Trump administration.          On Monday, Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani, Iraq's pre-eminent Shia cleric, demanded action from the government \"so as not to make Iraq an arena for settling regional and international accounts.\" But that settling is now gathering pace.          Fighters from the Kataib Hezbollah militia, inspect damage in the aftermath of a US airstrike in Qaim, Iraq.          Kataib Hezbollah is militantly anti-American. In 2017 and 2018, its fighters in Syria tried to attack the US-supported garrison at al-Tanf on the Iraqi border. Earlier this month it boasted of the failure of the \"Saudi-American-Zionist axis of evil.\"          It has provided hundreds of fighters for the Assad regime in Syria -- part of a broader Iranian effort to help stamp out the insurgency there -- and is an important element in Iranian efforts to extend its influence through northern Iraq and into Syria. The US strikes, notably, were against targets along the main route between Iran and Syria.          In recent months, Kataib Hezbollah has stepped up attacks on US facilities in Iraq in line with Iran's wider campaign of resistance against the re-imposition of sanctions by the US. To start with, these attacks were no more than irritants -- most of the rockets fell harmlessly some distance from US forces. But the range and potency of the attacks has grown, and they've become more accurate. In one attack in November, 17 rockets were fired on a base south of Mosul.          For the Iraqi government, the face-off between the US and pro-Iranian militia adds another source of instability in a country already deep in crisis. Roiling popular protests since October have pitted young Iraqis fed up with corruption and the lack of opportunity against the security forces and militia like Kata'ib who are accused of some of the harshest actions against demonstrators. The US has already sanctioned a leading Kataib Hezbollah official for human rights abuses.At least 485 people have been killed since protests erupted and at least 27,000 people have been injured, according to the Independent High Commission for Human Rights of Iraq.          The unrest has further weakened an already fragile economy and has triggered a political meltdown. Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi has resigned but no consensus candidate has yet emerged to replace him. Two constitutional deadlines to nominate a successor have come and gone.          In many places, the protests have taken on an anti-Iranian flavour, with the Iranian consulate in the city of Najaf torched last month.          Iraqi President Barham Salih, a Kurd, last week threatened to quit \"to avoid more bloodshed and in order to safeguard civil peace\" rather than approve a candidate for Prime Minister seen as pro-Iranian. Thousands of protestors, who are demanding fresh elections and an end to the domination of existing political blocs, took to the streets in support of Salih's stand.          But Iran has invested heavily in deepening its influence in an arc from Iraq through Syria to Lebanon and will not give up its strategic gains without a fight, even as US sanctions make its expansionism difficult to afford.          The political deadlock in Baghdad is beginning to look like a struggle between pro-Iranian Shia groups and Iraqi nationalists. And the airstrikes will embolden the pro-Iranian blocs in parliament to push again for the expulsion of US forces from Iraq.          The last time they left, at the end of 2011, ISIS took full advantage. The remnants of the group may now be savoring a new opportunity. They have been regrouping underground in provinces north of Baghdad. There has been a steady uptick in ambushes, bomb attacks and assassinations claimed by the group in the latter half of this year.          A proxy war between US forces and pro-Iranian groups that are notionally tied into the Iraqi military would make counter-terrorism operations -- the very reason the US still has 5,000 troops in Iraq -- more difficult.          The rhetoric suggests the US airstrikes will not go unanswered. Iran has said the US \"must accept responsibility of the consequences of the illegal attacks.\" Kataib Hezbollah called for \"a new phase of pride and honor, a phase to drive the brutal American enemy out of our holy land.\"          In November the senior US military commander in the region, Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, said Iran was trying to \"crack the campaign\" of US sanctions through attacks designed to provoke an American military response. If that's the case, Tehran may have succeeded.\n",

The attack lasted around two hours, only targeting the US areas of the air base, which comprise around a quarter of the Iraqi base.          Officers called it a \"miracle\" that there were no casualties at the blasted site, with missiles landing just a few meters from bunkers, and some essential personnel remaining outside throughout.          It is the first time troops at the base have spoken in detail of the moments before the attack, revealing that they were able to seek shelter in bunkers shortly before missiles struck.          US troops knew there was going to be an attack on their base -- they just didn't know what the nature of the attack would be. The ruined remains of the living quarters where soldiers were evacuated. The Iranian attack on the Al-Asad airbase was one of two on Iraqi military bases housing US troops on Wednesday. The attacks were in retaliation for a drone strike at a Baghdad airport that killed Iran's most powerful military commander, Qasem Soleimani, earlier in the week. President Donald Trump said Soleimani was plotting \"imminent and sinister attacks\" on Americans, though he has been unable to offer a time frame on when this would be. Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi previously said Iran sent Iraq an official verbal message that an attack \"had begun or would begin shortly,\" on unspecified US military locations. An Arab diplomatic source also told medianame that Iraq gave advance warning to the US on \"which bases would be hit\" after Iranian officials passed on the information. Lt. Col. Staci Colemsan said it was a \"miracle\" there were no casualties. The first strike hit at 1:34 a.m. and after a brief pause of around 15 minutes, the next volley began. Two more volleys of missiles followed over the next two hours. At dawn, officers finally emerged from bunkers to discover the full scale of destruction. The Al-Asad air base, which houses US troops, is one of the largest and oldest military bases in Iraq. It is located in Anbar province, a hotbed of ISIS activity in western Iraq between 2014 and 2017. Anbar was the birthplace of Sunni extremism in the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. In December 2018, Trump visited troops at Al-Asad. \"We came in, we felt very safe coming in. It was a pretty difficult journey in certain ways, but we felt very, very good, very safe,\" Trump said, according to a White House transcript. Vice President Mike Pence visited the base a year later to celebrate Thanksgiving with around 150 service members. The US military presence in Iraq has fluctuated greatly since the 2003 invasion. At its height, the US had 170,000 troops in Iraq. In 2011, former President Barack Obama withdrew US forces from the country. Around 5,000 troops were deployed to Iraq in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government, seeking US assistance in the fight against ISIS. Troop levels have been roughly the same since.\n",

Iraqis have had three such governments in the last three years, each with Sunnis in key posts, without noticeable effect. The alternative path out of this terrible trap has five elements.          The first is to establish three largely autonomous regions with a viable central government in Baghdad. The Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws, administration and internal security. The central government would control border defense, foreign affairs and oil revenues. Baghdad would become a federal zone, while densely populated areas of mixed populations would receive both multisectarian and international police protection.          Decentralization is hardly as radical as it may seem: the Iraqi Constitution, in fact, already provides for a federal structure and a procedure for provinces to combine into regional governments.          Besides, things are already heading toward partition: increasingly, each community supports federalism, if only as a last resort. The Sunnis, who until recently believed they would retake power in Iraq, are beginning to recognize that they won't and don't want to live in a Shiite-controlled, highly centralized state with laws enforced by sectarian militias. The Shiites know they can dominate the government, but they can't defeat a Sunni insurrection. The Kurds will not give up their 15-year-old autonomy.          Some will say moving toward strong regionalism would ignite sectarian cleansing. But that's exactly what is going on already, in ever-bigger waves. Others will argue that it would lead to partition. But a breakup is already under way. As it was in Bosnia, a strong federal system is a viable means to prevent both perils in Iraq.          The second element would be to entice the Sunnis into joining the federal system with an offer they couldn't refuse. To begin with, running their own region should be far preferable to the alternatives: being dominated by Kurds and Shiites in a central government or being the main victims of a civil war. But they also have to be given money to make their oil-poor region viable. The Constitution must be amended to guarantee Sunni areas 20 percent (approximately their proportion of the population) of all revenues.          The third component would be to ensure the protection of the rights of women and ethno-religious minorities by increasing American aid to Iraq but tying it to respect for those rights. Such protections will be difficult, especially in the Shiite-controlled south, but Washington has to be clear that widespread violations will stop the cash flow.          Fourth, the president must direct the military to design a plan for withdrawing and redeploying our troops from Iraq by 2008 (while providing for a small but effective residual force to combat terrorists and keep the neighbors honest). We must avoid a precipitous withdrawal that would lead to a national meltdown , but we also can't have a substantial long-term American military presence. That would do terrible damage to our armed forces, break American and Iraqi public support for the mission and leave Iraqis without any incentive to shape up.          Fifth, under an international or United Nations umbrella, we should convene a regional conference to pledge respect for Iraq's borders and its federal system. For all that Iraq's neighbors might gain by picking at its pieces, each faces the greater danger of a regional war. A \"contact group\" of major powers would be set up to lean on neighbors to comply with the deal.          Mr. Bush has spent three years in a futile effort to establish a strong central government in Baghdad, leaving us without a real political settlement, with a deteriorating security situation — and with nothing but the most difficult policy choices. The five-point alternative plan offers a plausible path to that core political settlement among Iraqis, along with the economic, military and diplomatic levers to make the political solution work. It is also a plausible way for Democrats and Republicans alike to protect our basic security interests and honor our country's sacrifices."

       "      <td>An Iranian businessman charged with exporting tons of carbon fiber, a controlled substance with military and nuclear uses, from the U.S. to Iran was sentenced to nearly four years in prison Thursday, the Justice Department announced. Behzad Pourghannad was extradited from Germany to face charges in July. He was charged with violating U.S. sanctions by circumventing export controls on carbon fiber, according to U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman of the Southern District of New York. Pourghannad pled guilty to the charges in August. DAUGHTER OF EX-FBI AGENT MISSING FOR OVER A DECADE IN IRAN THANKS TRUMP FOR 'CLEAR MESSAGE' TO TEHRAN          Carbon fiber can be used to make nose cones for long-range missiles and can be used to manufacture rotors in the centrifuges that enrich uranium. Iran in recent months has made numerous announcements that it would be violating international agreement to use advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium and increase its nuclear stockpile. IRAN ENRICHING URANIUM AT 'NOT DECLARED' SITE, UN NUCLEAR WATCHDOG SAYS          A United Nations nuclear watchdog revealed Monday that Iran is making good on that promise. Uranium of a man-made origin was found at a site not declared to inspectors. According to the announcement, Pourghannad and his co-conspirators, Ali Reza Shokri and Farzin Faridmanesh, lived and worked in Iran between 2008 and 2013. During that time they worked together to obtain the carbon fiber from the United States and secretly export it to Iran through third countries. Shokri procured the carbon fiber, Pourghannad served as the financial guarantor of the transactions and Faridmanesh served as the shipper. In the 2013 transaction alone, Pourghannad and Shokri negotiated for the purchase and shipment of more than five tons of carbon fiber to Iran by way of the nation of Georgia. Faridmanesh labeled the carbon fiber “acrylic” to sneak by U.S. export controls. The DOJ did not specify how much of the carbon fiber actually made it to Iran, or what would become of co-defendants Faridmanesh and Shokri.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Iran Acknowledges a Space Rocket Exploded Because of What Officials Called a Technical Malfunction</td>\n",
       "      <td>TEHRAN, Iran — Iran acknowledged for the first time on Monday that a rocket at its Imam Khomeini Space Center exploded after satellite photos showed the blast last week, with an official saying a technical malfunction during a test caused the explosion.          The comments by government spokesman Ali Rabiei were the first explanation offered by Iran for Thursday’s explosion, which came ahead of a planned satellite launch by the Islamic Republic that the U.S. has criticized.          Rabiei also criticized President Donald Trump for tweeting what appeared to be a surveillance photo of the aftermath of the explosion shot by a U.S. spy satellite.          The explosion marked the third failure involving a rocket at the Iranian center, which has raised suspicions of sabotage in Iran’s space program.          However, Rabiei dismissed that, saying that “this has been a technical matter and a technical error. Our experts unanimously say so.”          “The explosion happened at the launchpad and no satellite had yet been transferred to the launchpad,” Rabiei said. “It happened at a test site, not at the launch site.”          Commercially available satellite images by Planet Labs Inc. and Maxar Technologies showed a black plume of smoke rising above a launch pad Thursday, with what appeared to be the charred remains of a rocket and its launch stand. In previous days, satellite images had shown officials there repainted the launch pad blue.          The photo released Friday by Trump appeared to be a once-classified surveillance photo from American intelligence agencies. Analysts said the black rectangle in the photo’s upper-left-hand corner likely covered up the photo’s classification.          The image showed damaged vehicles around the launch pad, as well as damage done to the rocket’s launcher. It also clearly showed a large phrase written in Farsi on the pad: “National Product, National Power.”          “The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran,” Trump wrote in his tweet, identifying the rocket used. “I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One.”          Rabiei criticized Trump’s decision to tweet about the rocket explosion.          “We don’t understand why the U.S president tweets and posts satellite pictures with excitement. This is not understandable,” he said. “Maybe this is because lack of Iran-related subjects that they raise such issues.”          The blast followed two failed satellite launches of the Payam and Doosti in January and February. A separate fire at the Imam Khomeini Space Center in February also killed three researchers, authorities said at the time.          Over the past decade, Iran has sent several short-lived satellites into orbit and in 2013 launched a monkey into space.          Iran is preparing to launch the Nahid-1, a communication satellite, into space.          The U.S. alleges such satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution calling on Iran to undertake no activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.          Iran, which long has said it does not seek nuclear weapons, maintains its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component. Tehran also says it hasn’t violated the U.N. resolution as it only “called upon” Tehran not to conduct such tests.          The tests have taken on new importance to the U.S. amid the maximalist approach to Iran taken by President Donald Trump’s administration. Tensions have been high between the countries since Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from Iran’s nuclear deal over a year ago and imposed sanctions, including on Iran’s oil industry. Iran recently has begun to break the accord itself while trying to push Europe to help it sell oil abroad.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Christians mustn’t forget Israel amid conflict with Iran</td>\n",
       "      <td>Last week, President Trump said the United States is “ready to embrace peace” with Iran after missile strikes on military bases in Iraq. His decision not to respond with military force may end up saving American lives, but it’s Israel that could end up suffering the most. And with new U.S. sanctions against Iran, Christians can’t overlook the importance of U.S. support of Israel in the fragile upcoming months.          Geographically, it’s far easier for Iran to retaliate against Israel than it is to strike the U.S. itself. And Iran has a history of using terrorist proxies to commit violence throughout the Middle East. While Iran may have a great deal to lose from a conventional war with the U.S., it has a lot less to lose by continuing its pattern of proxy attacks.          The Shiite Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which receives $700 million a year in funds from Iran, is considered by many to be “the most powerful Iranian proxy in the Middle East.” Hezbollah will almost certainly attack Israel if the situation escalates. Iran, not surprisingly, has threatened attacks in Israel and Dubai. In 2016, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps labeled an Iranian missile with “Israel must be wiped off the earth” in Hebrew. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has frequently called Israel a “cancerous tumor” that should be destroyed.          Hezbollah is a sophisticated network. It provides education, healthcare, and other services to its Lebanese Shiite constituents. It has already managed to build tunnels up to 22 stories deep from Lebanon to Israel. Between December 2018 and January 2019 alone, Israel located six such tunnels. Some were even outfitted with electricity, communications, and lighting.          Iran also provides hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, weapons, and training to other terrorist groups that threaten Israel, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.          Thanks to shared values and common strategic interests, the U.S. has a long history of solidarity with Israel, the only genuine democracy in the Middle East and one of the most valuable U.S. allies. American support for Israel in this precarious time is also a statement in support of freedom of religion and open access to the holy sites of the world’s major faiths.          Moreover, Israel’s intelligence service partners with the U.S. in many covert operations and intelligence missions. Israel buys billions of dollars in weapons from the U.S., and its location within the Middle East provides a strategic site for new weapons testing. Trade between the U.S. and Israel is currently at over $30 billion.          In the midst of fears surrounding our own country’s safety, it is imperative that we not forget about the security of our allies. Christians should be ardent in demanding that Israel’s safety be a priority for our government.          Timothy Head is executive director for the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition.</td>\n",

       "      <td>California-based man abducted by Iran while in Dubai, his family says</td>\n",
       "      <td>Dubai, United Arab Emirates — A California-based member of an Iranian militant opposition group in exile was abducted by Iran while staying in Dubai, his family said Tuesday.          The suspected cross-border abduction of Jamshid Sharmahd appears corroborated by mobile phone location data, shared by his family with The Associated Press, that suggests he was taken to neighboring Oman before heading to Iran.          Iran hasn't said how it detained Sharmahd, though the announcement came against the backdrop of covert actions conducted by Iran amid heightened tensions with the U.S. over Tehran's collapsing nuclear deal with world powers.          Iran accuses Sharmahd, 65, of Glendora, California of planning a 2008 attack on a mosque that killed 14 people and wounded over 200 others, as well as plotting other assaults through the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing. It aired an interview of him on state television - footage that resembled many other suspected coerced confessions broadcast by the Iranian government in the last decade.          His family, however, insists Sharmahd only served as a spokesman for the group and had nothing to do with any attacks in Iran. Sharmahd, who supports restoring Iran's monarchy that was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, already had been targeted in an apparent Iranian assassination plot on U.S. soil in 2009.          \"We're seeking support from any democratic country, any free country,\" his son Shayan Sharmahd told the AP. \"It is a violation of human rights. You can't just pick someone up in a third country and drag them into your country.\"          Iran's Intelligence Ministry has not elaborated on how it detained the elder Sharmahd, other than to deny he was arrested in Tajikistan. The ministry and Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.          Sharmahd had been in Dubai, trying to travel to India for a business deal involving his software company, his son said. He was hoping to get a connecting flight despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic disrupting global travel.          Sharmahd's family received the last message from him on July 28. After that, he no longer responded to their calls and messages, his son said. Telephone location data showed his mobile phone that day at the Premier Inn Dubai International Airport Hotel, where he had been staying.          It's unclear how the abduction happened. A hotel operator said Sharmahd had checked out July 29. Tracking data showed Sharmahd's mobile phone traveled south from Dubai to the city of Al Ain on July 29, crossing the border into Oman and staying overnight near an Islamic school in the border city of al-Buraimi.          On July 30, tracking data showed the mobile phone traveled to the Omani port city of Sohar, where the signal stopped.          Two days later, on Saturday, Iran announced it had captured Sharmahd in a \"complex operation.\" The Intelligence Ministry published a photograph of him blindfolded.          His son said he believed that in the state TV footage, Sharmahd hurriedly read whatever Iran wanted him to say.          \"Imagine your own father being tied up one day on television and you see that,\" Shayan Sharmahd said.          Western officials believe Iran runs intelligence operations in Dubai and keeps tabs on the hundreds of thousands of Iranians living in the city-state. Iran is suspected of kidnapping and later killing British-Iranian national Abbas Yazdi in Dubai in 2013, though Tehran has denied involvement.          It isn't just Iran that maintains a presence in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, home to some 5,000 U.S. troops and the U.S. Navy's busiest port of call outside of America. The U.S. State Department runs its Iran Regional Presence Office in Dubai, where diplomats monitor Iranian media reports and talk to Iranians.          Dubai's hotels long have been targeted by intelligence operatives, such as in the suspected 2010 assassination by the Israeli Mossad of Hamas operative Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. Dubai and the rest of the UAE have since invested even more in an elaborate surveillance network.          Dubai police and officials, as well as federal officials in Abu Dhabi and the Omani Embassy in Washington, did not respond to requests for comment.          The UAE has long been trying to de-escalate tensions with Iran after President Trump's maximum pressure campaign saw him pull out of the nuclear deal. On Sunday, Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan held a videoconference with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.          However, over the last year, a series of escalating incidents have shaken the wider Mideast, leading to a U.S. drone strike in January that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad and an Iranian ballistic missile attack that injured dozens of American soldiers in Iraq. Also, there have been explosions on oil tankers off the Emirati coast that the U.S. Navy has blamed on Iranian limpet mines.          Last month, an oil tanker seized by the UAE after being suspected of smuggling Iranian crude oil was hijacked, likely by Iran. In June, Iran sentenced to death another opposition journalist living in Paris it detained under unclear circumstances.          For now, Sharmahd's family said they contacted the government in Germany, where he holds citizenship, and the U.S. government as he's lived for years in America and was on track for citizenship after the 2009 assassination plot.          The German Embassy in Tehran has asked Iranian authorities for consular access, according to the Foreign Ministry in Berlin, hoping to understand how Sharmahd was arrested. However, Iran doesn't allow consular access for its dual nationals, considering them exclusively Iranian citizens.          The State Department, which mistakenly referred to Sharmahd in an earlier report as an American citizen, acknowledged his arrest and said Iran \"has a long history of detaining Iranians and foreign nationals on spurious charges.\"          While Iran has yet to say what charges Sharmahd faces, others detained over the 2008 bombing have been convicted and executed. Sharmahd's son said his father suffers from Parkinson's disease, as well as diabetes and heart trouble that require medication and careful monitoring.          \"He's very much at risk,\" his son said. \"All of us are extremely concerned.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trump calls for new Iran deal</td>\n",
       "      <td>With the Middle East on high alert after an attack on Saudi oil facilities, world leaders were jockeying at the United Nations on Monday to respond to the attack and find a resolution to heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran.          President Donald Trump said he was ready for a new agreement with Iran, a year and a half after he withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal and stringently reimposed sanctions on Tehran. But Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, who arrived in New York on Monday for the U.N. General Assembly, has said there will be no negotiations until Trump eases or lifts sanctions, which the U.S. agreed to do under the original deal.          When asked by medianame News on Monday whether Rouhani would meet Trump, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded emphatically, \"No!\"          After expressing an openness to meeting Rouhani last month, Trump seemed to admit it's no longer likely.          \"We have a long way to go. We'll have to see what happens. We're doing just fine,\" he told reporters as he entered the U.N.          Hours later, during a photo op with Singapore's prime minister, Trump talked up his tough sanctions.          \"We have a lot of pressure on them right now -- more pressure than they've ever had. ... A lot of things are happening with respect to Iran. A lot more than you would know. A lot more than the media knows, OK? I’ll be discussing it a little bit tomorrow,\" he said, one day before his address to the U.N. General Assembly.          Still, while the U.S. and Iranian delegations are not likely to meet, other world leaders are trying to step in to resolve tensions between the two. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to Trump on Monday morning before his meeting with Rouhani on Monday evening, he told reporters -- with a Trump meeting possible for Tuesday.          The attack on Saudi Arabia's oil processing facilities, one of the largest in the world, seems to have changed the calculus for the European countries who remain signatories to the nuclear deal -- Germany, France and the United Kingdom -- and have tried to lower tensions between the U.S. and Iran. In a joint statement Monday, they said they had concluded, \"Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation.\"          But the diplomatic divide with the Trump administration over the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, remains.          The U.S. and Europe now agree on the need to begin negotiations with Iran on a new agreement. The joint European statement said, \"Time has come for Iran to accept negotiation on a long-term framework for its nuclear programme as well as on issues related to regional security, including its missiles programme and other means of deliver.\"          But how to get to those talks is the source of division. The Europeans have proposed an interim agreement where Iran returns to compliance with the nuclear deal in exchange for the U.S. permitting some economic aid to Iran, for example through a $15 billion line of credit. If the two sides agreed to that, a diplomatic source told medianame News, the hope is that they could begin negotiations on a new deal that extends the nuclear deal's limits on Iran and addresses its ballistic missile program.          When Macron first broached the subject with Trump during the G-7 summit in late August, Trump said he liked the idea and would consider it. But on Monday, he bristled at the idea of Macron mediating.          \"He's a friend of mine, but we're not looking for any mediators. They know who to call,\" he said of Iran's leaders.          His senior advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have also shot down the idea and made clear that they will do nothing to halt their \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran.          That campaign involves the tightest economic sanctions against Iran ever, with a push to halt all Iranian oil exports and the designation of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite wing of its military, as a foreign terrorist organization. In response to that pressure, Iran has spent the last few months lashing out in the Persian Gulf -- attacking commercial oil tankers, shooting down a U.S. drone, seizing a handful of ships and attacking one of the world's largest oil processing facilities in Saudi Arabia.          Iran denies responsibility for that attack, which took out more than half of Saudi oil production. But it has started to violate its commitments under the nuclear deal, with each step demanding that European powers step in and provide economic aid or else they'll violate another threshold.          During the General Assembly, the Trump administration intends to bring the focus on Iran after blaming it for the massive Saudi attack, according to a senior State Department official, but they added that the U.S. is really looking for the Saudis to take the lead and present evidence to the U.N. to rally international support for them after they suffered this attack.          \"Now it's up to the international community and really up to Saudi Arabia for what they're going to say this week, what they're going to present to the U.N. because it was the Saudis that were attacked and had almost 60% of their oil supply taken off the market,\" the official said.</td>\n",

Behzad Pourghannad was extradited from Germany to face charges in July. He was charged with violating U.S. sanctions by circumventing export controls on carbon fiber, according to U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman of the Southern District of New York. Pourghannad pled guilty to the charges in August. DAUGHTER OF EX-FBI AGENT MISSING FOR OVER A DECADE IN IRAN THANKS TRUMP FOR 'CLEAR MESSAGE' TO TEHRAN          Carbon fiber can be used to make nose cones for long-range missiles and can be used to manufacture rotors in the centrifuges that enrich uranium. Iran in recent months has made numerous announcements that it would be violating international agreement to use advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium and increase its nuclear stockpile. IRAN ENRICHING URANIUM AT 'NOT DECLARED' SITE, UN NUCLEAR WATCHDOG SAYS          A United Nations nuclear watchdog revealed Monday that Iran is making good on that promise. Uranium of a man-made origin was found at a site not declared to inspectors. According to the announcement, Pourghannad and his co-conspirators, Ali Reza Shokri and Farzin Faridmanesh, lived and worked in Iran between 2008 and 2013. During that time they worked together to obtain the carbon fiber from the United States and secretly export it to Iran through third countries. Shokri procured the carbon fiber, Pourghannad served as the financial guarantor of the transactions and Faridmanesh served as the shipper. In the 2013 transaction alone, Pourghannad and Shokri negotiated for the purchase and shipment of more than five tons of carbon fiber to Iran by way of the nation of Georgia. Faridmanesh labeled the carbon fiber “acrylic” to sneak by U.S. export controls. The DOJ did not specify how much of the carbon fiber actually made it to Iran, or what would become of co-defendants Faridmanesh and Shokri.\n",

The comments by government spokesman Ali Rabiei were the first explanation offered by Iran for Thursday’s explosion, which came ahead of a planned satellite launch by the Islamic Republic that the U.S. has criticized.          Rabiei also criticized President Donald Trump for tweeting what appeared to be a surveillance photo of the aftermath of the explosion shot by a U.S. spy satellite.          The explosion marked the third failure involving a rocket at the Iranian center, which has raised suspicions of sabotage in Iran’s space program.          However, Rabiei dismissed that, saying that “this has been a technical matter and a technical error. Our experts unanimously say so.”          “The explosion happened at the launchpad and no satellite had yet been transferred to the launchpad,” Rabiei said. “It happened at a test site, not at the launch site.”          Commercially available satellite images by Planet Labs Inc. and Maxar Technologies showed a black plume of smoke rising above a launch pad Thursday, with what appeared to be the charred remains of a rocket and its launch stand. In previous days, satellite images had shown officials there repainted the launch pad blue.          The photo released Friday by Trump appeared to be a once-classified surveillance photo from American intelligence agencies. Analysts said the black rectangle in the photo’s upper-left-hand corner likely covered up the photo’s classification.          The image showed damaged vehicles around the launch pad, as well as damage done to the rocket’s launcher. It also clearly showed a large phrase written in Farsi on the pad: “National Product, National Power.”          “The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran,” Trump wrote in his tweet, identifying the rocket used. “I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One.”          Rabiei criticized Trump’s decision to tweet about the rocket explosion.          “We don’t understand why the U.S president tweets and posts satellite pictures with excitement. This is not understandable,” he said. “Maybe this is because lack of Iran-related subjects that they raise such issues.”          The blast followed two failed satellite launches of the Payam and Doosti in January and February. A separate fire at the Imam Khomeini Space Center in February also killed three researchers, authorities said at the time.          Over the past decade, Iran has sent several short-lived satellites into orbit and in 2013 launched a monkey into space.          Iran is preparing to launch the Nahid-1, a communication satellite, into space.          The U.S. alleges such satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution calling on Iran to undertake no activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.          Iran, which long has said it does not seek nuclear weapons, maintains its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component. Tehran also says it hasn’t violated the U.N. resolution as it only “called upon” Tehran not to conduct such tests.          The tests have taken on new importance to the U.S. amid the maximalist approach to Iran taken by President Donald Trump’s administration. Tensions have been high between the countries since Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from Iran’s nuclear deal over a year ago and imposed sanctions, including on Iran’s oil industry. Iran recently has begun to break the accord itself while trying to push Europe to help it sell oil abroad.\n",

His decision not to respond with military force may end up saving American lives, but it’s Israel that could end up suffering the most. And with new U.S. sanctions against Iran, Christians can’t overlook the importance of U.S. support of Israel in the fragile upcoming months.          Geographically, it’s far easier for Iran to retaliate against Israel than it is to strike the U.S. itself. And Iran has a history of using terrorist proxies to commit violence throughout the Middle East. While Iran may have a great deal to lose from a conventional war with the U.S., it has a lot less to lose by continuing its pattern of proxy attacks.          The Shiite Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which receives $700 million a year in funds from Iran, is considered by many to be “the most powerful Iranian proxy in the Middle East.” Hezbollah will almost certainly attack Israel if the situation escalates. Iran, not surprisingly, has threatened attacks in Israel and Dubai. In 2016, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps labeled an Iranian missile with “Israel must be wiped off the earth” in Hebrew. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has frequently called Israel a “cancerous tumor” that should be destroyed.          Hezbollah is a sophisticated network. It provides education, healthcare, and other services to its Lebanese Shiite constituents. It has already managed to build tunnels up to 22 stories deep from Lebanon to Israel. Between December 2018 and January 2019 alone, Israel located six such tunnels. Some were even outfitted with electricity, communications, and lighting.          Iran also provides hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, weapons, and training to other terrorist groups that threaten Israel, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.          Thanks to shared values and common strategic interests, the U.S. has a long history of solidarity with Israel, the only genuine democracy in the Middle East and one of the most valuable U.S. allies. American support for Israel in this precarious time is also a statement in support of freedom of religion and open access to the holy sites of the world’s major faiths.          Moreover, Israel’s intelligence service partners with the U.S. in many covert operations and intelligence missions. Israel buys billions of dollars in weapons from the U.S., and its location within the Middle East provides a strategic site for new weapons testing. Trade between the U.S. and Israel is currently at over $30 billion.          In the midst of fears surrounding our own country’s safety, it is imperative that we not forget about the security of our allies. Christians should be ardent in demanding that Israel’s safety be a priority for our government.          Timothy Head is executive director for the Faith & Freedom Coalition.\n",
       "920                               California-based man abducted by Iran while in Dubai, his family says  Dubai, United Arab Emirates — A California-based member of an Iranian militant opposition group in exile was abducted by Iran while staying in Dubai, his family said Tuesday.          The suspected cross-border abduction of Jamshid Sharmahd appears corroborated by mobile phone location data, shared by his family with The Associated Press, that suggests he was taken to neighboring Oman before heading to Iran.          Iran hasn't said how it detained Sharmahd, though the announcement came against the backdrop of covert actions conducted by Iran amid heightened tensions with the U.S. over Tehran's collapsing nuclear deal with world powers.          Iran accuses Sharmahd, 65, of Glendora, California of planning a 2008 attack on a mosque that killed 14 people and wounded over 200 others, as well as plotting other assaults through the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing. It aired an interview of him on state television - footage that resembled many other suspected coerced confessions broadcast by the Iranian government in the last decade.          His family, however, insists Sharmahd only served as a spokesman for the group and had nothing to do with any attacks in Iran. Sharmahd, who supports restoring Iran's monarchy that was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, already had been targeted in an apparent Iranian assassination plot on U.S. soil in 2009.          \"We're seeking support from any democratic country, any free country,\" his son Shayan Sharmahd told the AP. \"It is a violation of human rights. You can't just pick someone up in a third country and drag them into your country.\"          Iran's Intelligence Ministry has not elaborated on how it detained the elder Sharmahd, other than to deny he was arrested in Tajikistan. The ministry and Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.          Sharmahd had been in Dubai, trying to travel to India for a business deal involving his software company, his son said. He was hoping to get a connecting flight despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic disrupting global travel.          Sharmahd's family received the last message from him on July 28. After that, he no longer responded to their calls and messages, his son said. Telephone location data showed his mobile phone that day at the Premier Inn Dubai International Airport Hotel, where he had been staying.          It's unclear how the abduction happened. A hotel operator said Sharmahd had checked out July 29. Tracking data showed Sharmahd's mobile phone traveled south from Dubai to the city of Al Ain on July 29, crossing the border into Oman and staying overnight near an Islamic school in the border city of al-Buraimi.          On July 30, tracking data showed the mobile phone traveled to the Omani port city of Sohar, where the signal stopped.          Two days later, on Saturday, Iran announced it had captured Sharmahd in a \"complex operation.\" The Intelligence Ministry published a photograph of him blindfolded.          His son said he believed that in the state TV footage, Sharmahd hurriedly read whatever Iran wanted him to say.          \"Imagine your own father being tied up one day on television and you see that,\" Shayan Sharmahd said.          Western officials believe Iran runs intelligence operations in Dubai and keeps tabs on the hundreds of thousands of Iranians living in the city-state. Iran is suspected of kidnapping and later killing British-Iranian national Abbas Yazdi in Dubai in 2013, though Tehran has denied involvement.          It isn't just Iran that maintains a presence in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, home to some 5,000 U.S. troops and the U.S. Navy's busiest port of call outside of America. The U.S. State Department runs its Iran Regional Presence Office in Dubai, where diplomats monitor Iranian media reports and talk to Iranians.          Dubai's hotels long have been targeted by intelligence operatives, such as in the suspected 2010 assassination by the Israeli Mossad of Hamas operative Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. Dubai and the rest of the UAE have since invested even more in an elaborate surveillance network.          Dubai police and officials, as well as federal officials in Abu Dhabi and the Omani Embassy in Washington, did not respond to requests for comment.          The UAE has long been trying to de-escalate tensions with Iran after President Trump's maximum pressure campaign saw him pull out of the nuclear deal. On Sunday, Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan held a videoconference with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.          However, over the last year, a series of escalating incidents have shaken the wider Mideast, leading to a U.S. drone strike in January that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad and an Iranian ballistic missile attack that injured dozens of American soldiers in Iraq. Also, there have been explosions on oil tankers off the Emirati coast that the U.S. Navy has blamed on Iranian limpet mines.          Last month, an oil tanker seized by the UAE after being suspected of smuggling Iranian crude oil was hijacked, likely by Iran. In June, Iran sentenced to death another opposition journalist living in Paris it detained under unclear circumstances.          For now, Sharmahd's family said they contacted the government in Germany, where he holds citizenship, and the U.S. government as he's lived for years in America and was on track for citizenship after the 2009 assassination plot.          The German Embassy in Tehran has asked Iranian authorities for consular access, according to the Foreign Ministry in Berlin, hoping to understand how Sharmahd was arrested. However, Iran doesn't allow consular access for its dual nationals, considering them exclusively Iranian citizens.          The State Department, which mistakenly referred to Sharmahd in an earlier report as an American citizen, acknowledged his arrest and said Iran \"has a long history of detaining Iranians and foreign nationals on spurious charges.\"          While Iran has yet to say what charges Sharmahd faces, others detained over the 2008 bombing have been convicted and executed. Sharmahd's son said his father suffers from Parkinson's disease, as well as diabetes and heart trouble that require medication and careful monitoring.          \"He's very much at risk,\" his son said. \"All of us are extremely concerned.\"\n",

President Donald Trump said he was ready for a new agreement with Iran, a year and a half after he withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal and stringently reimposed sanctions on Tehran. But Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, who arrived in New York on Monday for the U.N. General Assembly, has said there will be no negotiations until Trump eases or lifts sanctions, which the U.S. agreed to do under the original deal.          When asked by medianame News on Monday whether Rouhani would meet Trump, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded emphatically, \"No!\"          After expressing an openness to meeting Rouhani last month, Trump seemed to admit it's no longer likely.          \"We have a long way to go. We'll have to see what happens. We're doing just fine,\" he told reporters as he entered the U.N.          Hours later, during a photo op with Singapore's prime minister, Trump talked up his tough sanctions.          \"We have a lot of pressure on them right now -- more pressure than they've ever had. ... A lot of things are happening with respect to Iran. A lot more than you would know. A lot more than the media knows, OK? I’ll be discussing it a little bit tomorrow,\" he said, one day before his address to the U.N. General Assembly.          Still, while the U.S. and Iranian delegations are not likely to meet, other world leaders are trying to step in to resolve tensions between the two. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to Trump on Monday morning before his meeting with Rouhani on Monday evening, he told reporters -- with a Trump meeting possible for Tuesday.          The attack on Saudi Arabia's oil processing facilities, one of the largest in the world, seems to have changed the calculus for the European countries who remain signatories to the nuclear deal -- Germany, France and the United Kingdom -- and have tried to lower tensions between the U.S. and Iran. In a joint statement Monday, they said they had concluded, \"Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation.\"          But the diplomatic divide with the Trump administration over the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, remains.          The U.S. and Europe now agree on the need to begin negotiations with Iran on a new agreement. The joint European statement said, \"Time has come for Iran to accept negotiation on a long-term framework for its nuclear programme as well as on issues related to regional security, including its missiles programme and other means of deliver.\"          But how to get to those talks is the source of division. The Europeans have proposed an interim agreement where Iran returns to compliance with the nuclear deal in exchange for the U.S. permitting some economic aid to Iran, for example through a $15 billion line of credit. If the two sides agreed to that, a diplomatic source told medianame News, the hope is that they could begin negotiations on a new deal that extends the nuclear deal's limits on Iran and addresses its ballistic missile program.          When Macron first broached the subject with Trump during the G-7 summit in late August, Trump said he liked the idea and would consider it. But on Monday, he bristled at the idea of Macron mediating.          \"He's a friend of mine, but we're not looking for any mediators. They know who to call,\" he said of Iran's leaders.          His senior advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have also shot down the idea and made clear that they will do nothing to halt their \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran.          That campaign involves the tightest economic sanctions against Iran ever, with a push to halt all Iranian oil exports and the designation of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite wing of its military, as a foreign terrorist organization. In response to that pressure, Iran has spent the last few months lashing out in the Persian Gulf -- attacking commercial oil tankers, shooting down a U.S. drone, seizing a handful of ships and attacking one of the world's largest oil processing facilities in Saudi Arabia.          Iran denies responsibility for that attack, which took out more than half of Saudi oil production. But it has started to violate its commitments under the nuclear deal, with each step demanding that European powers step in and provide economic aid or else they'll violate another threshold.          During the General Assembly, the Trump administration intends to bring the focus on Iran after blaming it for the massive Saudi attack, according to a senior State Department official, but they added that the U.S. is really looking for the Saudis to take the lead and present evidence to the U.N. to rally international support for them after they suffered this attack.          \"Now it's up to the international community and really up to Saudi Arabia for what they're going to say this week, what they're going to present to the U.N. because it was the Saudis that were attacked and had almost 60% of their oil supply taken off the market,\" the official said."

       "      <td>Syria awarded Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani its highest military honor on Monday while Iranian student protesters took to the streets to tear down posters set up in his memory. Soleimani was killed in a U.S. airstrike outside Iraq’s Baghdad International Airport on Jan. 2.          Syrian Prime Minister Imad Khamis announced that President Bashar Assad had awarded Soleimani the medal while meeting with Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri in Tehran. “Awarding this medal reveals the Syrian president’s deep affection for Gen. Soleimani and for his brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Khamis said, according to Iran’s Tasnim News.          The medal was not named in the news article but was described as Syria's \"top medal of honor.\"          Meanwhile, protesters walked the streets of Iran, chanting anti-government statements and claiming Soleimani was no hero.          \"Soleimani was a murderer, his leader is, too,\" protesters chanted, referring to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.                               The posthumous award from Syria was predictable, one Iran-watcher said.          “No surprise that an Iranian client state would do this, and no surprise of course that Assad would do it,” former intelligence officer Michael Pregent told the medianame. Giving Soleimani the award is “slapping the face” of the hundreds of thousands of people who have died in the Syrian civil war, Pregent said.                               As head of Iran's Quds Force, Soleimani directed covert operations across the Middle East. More than 600 U.S. troops died due to Iranian support of insurgents in Iraq, according to the Department of Defense. Additionally, Iran is credited with helping save Assad, a key ally, by providing troops, weapons, and training to his regime as it continues to fight a civil war.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a United States airstrike in Baghdad on Thursday will likely unite Iran and its allies in mourning the man some considered to be Tehran's second most powerful leader. But little is known outside the Middle East about the man who played such a key role in shaping conflicts across the region. The 62-year-old led the elite Quds Force, part of Iran's Revolutionary Guards that also reports to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Soleimani was also accused of controlling proxy militias across the Middle East including ones in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. He has been characterized as a murderer by many U.S. government officials, ranging from President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Announcing his death, the Pentagon blamed Soleimani for orchestrating a series of attacks on allied bases in Iraq in recent months, most recently a rocket strike last week that killed a U.S. contractor and wounded four other service members. That killing prompted the U.S. to conduct five airstrikes across Iraq and Syria, targeting an Iranian-backed militia group it said was responsible for the attack. In turn, those bombings saw hundreds of the militia's supporters storm the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad. The Pentagon also said Soleimani had been actively developing plans to attack U.S. diplomats and service members in Iraq and elsewhere throughout the region. On Friday, Khamenei called Soleimani a martyr and declared a three-day national mourning period for him and other senior officials killed in the airstrike. \"He was a stellar example of those educated and nurtured in Islam,\" Khamenei said in a statement Friday that also called for \"severe revenge.\" Soleimani led the Quds, which is designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. and was considered the most powerful intelligence operative in the Middle East, for more than two decades. He was behind the seizure of the Iraqi oil-rich city of Kirkuk from American-allied Kurdish forces in 2017. He helped negotiate for the Iraqi government and Shiite militias to take the city largely uncontested. It was viewed as an embarrassing strategic blow to the U.S. at the time. But Soleimani is also credited with fighting the Islamic State militant group in Iraq. In a 2017 public letter, he denounced the \"evil movement\" that managed \"to deceive tens of thousands of Muslim youth\" in Iraq and Syria, while also blaming the U.S. for the rise and spread of ISIS. Iran had launched airstrikes against ISIS fighters outside Baghdad in late 2014 just as the United States and its coalition partners were taking on the extremist group. ISIS, made up of Sunni extremists, was ideologically at odds with Soleimani and the Iranian Shiite regime he defended. Soleimani and his commanders were on the front lines in Iraq and his name became synonymous with victories attributed to Iraqi ground forces. He had presented himself as the face of the offensive in Tikrit, a city which fell under ISIS control in 2014. Iran sought to highlight his efforts against ISIS while protesting his death Friday. Zarif said the slain general had dedicated his life \"to fighting tyranny, oppression, terror and extremism.\" Reported to have been raised in poverty in the mountains of eastern Iran, Soleimani went from being a construction worker to climbing the ranks of Iran's military as a young man following the Islamic Revolution of 1979. He became known as a war hero and a patriot, risking his life to minimize casualties among his men in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, according to a 2011 American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research report. His track record includes support of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The United Nations had imposed an asset freeze and travel ban on him in 2007, and the U.S. sanctioned him again in response to his alleged involvement in the Syrian war in 2011. Long known as the \"shadow commander\" in Western media, his profile was raised in 2015 as Iranian outlets began releasing photos of him in the battlefield guiding the war against ISIS. His face was soon plastered on T-shirts and his name mentioned in Shiite music videos. His power was compared to that of a vice president.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BAGHDAD (AP) — Thousands of mourners chanting “America is the Great Satan” marched in a funeral procession Saturday through Baghdad for Iran's top general and Iraqi militant leaders, who were killed in a U.S. airstrike. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds force and mastermind of its regional security strategy, was killed in an airstrike early Friday near the Iraqi capital's international airport that has caused regional tensions to soar. Iran has vowed harsh retaliation, raising fears of an all-outwar. U.S. President Donald Trump says he ordered the strike to prevent a conflict. His administration says Soleimani was plotting a series of attacks that endangered American troops and officials, without providing evidence. An official with the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq said it has scaled back operations and boosted “security and defensive measures” at bases hosting coalition forces in the country. The official spoke on condition of anonymity according to regulations. Washington has dispatched another 3,000 troops to neighboring Kuwait. MICHAEL PREGENT: TRUMP CONFRONTS IRAN WITH STRENGTH - OBAMA SHOWED WEAKNESS AND IRAN BECAME MORE DANGEROUS          Soleimani was the architect of Iran's regional policy of mobilizing militias across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, including in the war against the Islamic State group. He was also blamed for attacks on U.S. troops and American allies going back to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The mourners, mostly men in black military fatigues, carried Iraqi flags and the flags of Iran-backed militias that are fiercely loyal to Soleimani. They were also mourning Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a senior Iraqi militia commander who was killed in the same strike. SUSAN RICE SAYS OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 'DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY' TO KILL SOLEIMANI          The procession began at the Imam Kadhim shrine in Baghdad, one of the most revered sites in Shiite Islam. Mourners marched in the streets alongside militia vehicles in a solemn procession. The mourners, many of them in tears, chanted: \"No, No, America,\" and “Death to America, death to Israel.” Mohammed Fadl, a mourner dressed in black, said the funeral is an expression of loyalty to the slain leaders. “It is a painful strike, but it will not shake us,” he said. Two helicopters hovered over the procession, which was attended by Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and leaders of Iran-backed militias. The gates to Baghdad's Green Zone, which houses government offices and foreign embassies, including the U.S. Embassy, were closed. TUCKER CARLSON ON SOLEIMANI KILLING: 'THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF BAD PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD. WE CAN'T KILL THEM ALL'          Iraq, which is closely allied with both Washington and Tehran, condemned the airstrike that killed Soleimani and called it an attack on its national sovereignty. Parliament is to meet for an emergency session on Sunday, and the government has come under mounting pressure to expel the 5,200 American troops based in the country, who are there to help prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group. The U.S. has ordered all citizens to leave Iraq and closed its embassy in Baghdad, where Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters staged two days of violent protests earlier this week in which they breached the compound. The British government has warned travelers not to go anywhere in the country except for the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, and there only for trips considered essential. In its advisory, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the security situation “could deteriorate quickly.\" No one was hurt in the embassy protests, which came in response to U.S. airstrikes that killed 25 Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. said the strikes were in response to a rocket attack that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq, which Washington blamed on the militias. FORMER CIA DIRECTOR PREDICTS 'HIGH COST' FOR SOLEIMANI STRIKE: THERE WILL BE 'DEAD CIVILIAN AMERICANS'          Tensions between the U.S. and Iran have steadily intensified since Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal and restore crippling sanctions. The administration's “maximum pressure” campaign has led Iran to openly abandon commitments under the deal. The U.S. has also blamed Iran for a wave of increasingly provocative attacks in the region, including the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure in September that temporarily halved its production. Iran denied involvement in those attacks, but admitted to shooting down a U.S. surveillance drone in June that it said had strayed into its airspace. On Saturday, billboards appeared on major streets in Iran showing Soleimani and carrying the warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that “harsh revenge” awaits the US. Iranian state television also aired images of a ceremony honoring Soleimani at a mosque in the Shiite holy city of Qom, where a red flag was unfurled above the minarets. Red flags in Shiite tradition symbolize both blood spilled unjustly and serve as a call to avenge a person who is slain. US TO SEND 3,000 MORE TROOPS TO MIDDLE EAST FOLLOWING SOLEIMANI DEATH: OFFICIALS          Iranian President Hassan Rouhani visited Soleimani’s home in Tehran to express his condolences. “The Americans did not realize what a great mistake they made,” Rouhani said. “They will see the effects of this criminal act, not only today but for years to come.”          Global powers had warned Friday that the killing of Soleimani could spark a dangerous new escalation, with many calling for restraint. Iran’s state TV reported that Qatar’s foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, made an unplanned trip to Iran where he met with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. The Qatari diplomat was also set to meet with Rouhani. Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs, took to Twitter to reiterate the kingdom's call for \"self-restraint\" to avoid “unbearable consequences.”          Another Saudi official confirmed to The Associated Press that the U.S. did not give a heads-up to Saudi Arabia or its other Gulf allies before carrying out the strike that killed Soleimani. The official was not authorized to discuss security matters and so spoke on condition of anonymity. Illustrating Soleimani's regional reach, Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip, including the territory’s Hamas rulers, opened a mourning site for the slain general and dozens gathered to burn American and Israeli flags.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Iran has promised “harsh revenge.” Already, a series of rockets launched in Baghdad late Saturday fell inside or near the Green Zone, which houses government offices and foreign embassies, including the U.S. Embassy.          Trump wrote on Twitter afterward that the U.S. had already “targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp; the Iranian culture.”          Trump did not identify the targets but added that they would be “HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.”          After thousands in Baghdad on Saturday mourned Soleimani and others killed in the strike, authorities flew the general’s body to the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. An honor guard stood by early Sunday as mourners carried the flag-draped coffins of Soleimani and other Guard members off the tarmac.          Officials brought Soleimani’s body to Ahvaz, a city that was a focus of fighting during the bloody, 1980-88 war between Iraq and Iran in which the general slowly grew to prominence. After that war, Soleimani joined the Guard’s newly formed Quds, or Jersualem, Force, an expeditionary force that works with Iranian proxy forces in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.          Authorities also plan to take Soleimani’s body to Mashhad later Sunday, as well as Tehran and Qom on Monday for public mourning processions, then onto his hometown of Kerman for burial Tuesday.          Soleimani was the architect of Iran’s regional policy of mobilizing militias across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, including in the war against the Islamic State group. He was also blamed for attacks on U.S. troops and American allies going back decades.          Though it’s unclear how or when Iran may respond, any retaliation was likely to come after three days of mourning declared in both Iran and Iraq. All eyes were on Iraq, where America and Iran have competed for influence since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.          After the airstrike early Friday, the U.S.-led coalition has scaled back operations and boosted “security and defensive measures” at bases hosting coalition forces in Iraq, a coalition official said on condition of anonymity according to regulations.          Meanwhile, the U.S. has dispatched another 3,000 troops to neighboring Kuwait, the latest in a series of deployments in recent months as the standoff with Iran has worsened. Protesters held demonstrations in dozens of U.S. cities Saturday over Trump’s decisions to kill Soleimani and deploy more troops to the Mideast.          In a thinly veiled threat, one of the Iran-backed militia, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, or League of the Righteous, called on Iraqi security forces to stay at least a kilometer (0.6 miles) away from U.S. bases starting Sunday night. However, U.S. troops are invariably based in Iraqi military posts alongside local forces.          Iraq’s government, which is closely allied with Iran, condemned the airstrike that killed Soleimani, calling it an attack on its national sovereignty. Parliament is meeting for an emergency session Sunday, and the government has come under mounting pressure to expel the 5,200 American troops who are based in the country to help prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group.

       "      <td>WASHINGTON — Planned attacks against American military, diplomatic and financial targets in Lebanon and Syria comprised the imminent threat cited by U.S. officials as the reason President Donald Trump ordered the killing of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, multiple U.S. officials said Friday.          \"When we start seeing extensive and very solid intelligence that [Soleimani] is plotting imminent attacks against the United States, the president as commander in chief has a duty to take decisive action,\" said a senior State Department official speaking on condition of anonymity. \"If we had not taken this action, and hundreds of Americans were dead, you would be asking me why didn't you take out Soleimani when you have the chance.\"          A senior U.S. defense official said the U.S. alerted the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat team to prepare to deploy to protect U.S. diplomatic facilities in Lebanon should they come under attack. Despite the fact the entire brigade was put on alert, the official said the most likely deployment would be a rifle company or a battalion, somewhere between 130 to 750 total troops.          Targets in Syria that were under imminent threat included military outposts the U.S. maintains in the eastern part of the country, current and former officials said. In Lebanon, Soleimani was allegedly planning attacks on diplomatic and financial targets, they said.          \"He was actively plotting in the region to take actions — big action as he described it - that would have put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview on CNN. A U.S. drone strike that killed Soleimani Thursday in Baghdad stopped an \"imminent attack\" against Americans that Soleimani was actively working to implement, Pompeo said.          A senior U.S. official said recently Soleimani traveled to Syria, Lebanon and then to Iraq Thursday, and U.S. intelligence officials believe he was approving final plans for attacks in each location.          Administration officials were expected to brief lawmakers on the operation. So far the administration has declined to provide details publicly of the intelligence assessment that prompted the strike against Soleimani.          Members of Congress have expressed concern about retaliation from Iran, which its leadership has said it will take. Democrats in particular have expressed concern that Trump's authorization of a strike against Soleimani will escalate to a full-blown war with Iran, and they've demanded details of the \"imminent\" threat.          The National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</td>\n",

Qassem Soleimani its highest military honor on Monday while Iranian student protesters took to the streets to tear down posters set up in his memory. Soleimani was killed in a U.S. airstrike outside Iraq’s Baghdad International Airport on Jan. 2.          Syrian Prime Minister Imad Khamis announced that President Bashar Assad had awarded Soleimani the medal while meeting with Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri in Tehran. “Awarding this medal reveals the Syrian president’s deep affection for Gen. Soleimani and for his brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Khamis said, according to Iran’s Tasnim News.          The medal was not named in the news article but was described as Syria's \"top medal of honor.\"          Meanwhile, protesters walked the streets of Iran, chanting anti-government statements and claiming Soleimani was no hero.          \"Soleimani was a murderer, his leader is, too,\" protesters chanted, referring to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.                               The posthumous award from Syria was predictable, one Iran-watcher said.          “No surprise that an Iranian client state would do this, and no surprise of course that Assad would do it,” former intelligence officer Michael Pregent told the medianame. Giving Soleimani the award is “slapping the face” of the hundreds of thousands of people who have died in the Syrian civil war, Pregent said.                               As head of Iran's Quds Force, Soleimani directed covert operations across the Middle East. More than 600 U.S. troops died due to Iranian support of insurgents in Iraq, according to the Department of Defense. Additionally, Iran is credited with helping save Assad, a key ally, by providing troops, weapons, and training to his regime as it continues to fight a civil war.\n",

The death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a United States airstrike in Baghdad on Thursday will likely unite Iran and its allies in mourning the man some considered to be Tehran's second most powerful leader. But little is known outside the Middle East about the man who played such a key role in shaping conflicts across the region. The 62-year-old led the elite Quds Force, part of Iran's Revolutionary Guards that also reports to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Soleimani was also accused of controlling proxy militias across the Middle East including ones in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. He has been characterized as a murderer by many U.S. government officials, ranging from President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Announcing his death, the Pentagon blamed Soleimani for orchestrating a series of attacks on allied bases in Iraq in recent months, most recently a rocket strike last week that killed a U.S. contractor and wounded four other service members. That killing prompted the U.S. to conduct five airstrikes across Iraq and Syria, targeting an Iranian-backed militia group it said was responsible for the attack. In turn, those bombings saw hundreds of the militia's supporters storm the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad. The Pentagon also said Soleimani had been actively developing plans to attack U.S. diplomats and service members in Iraq and elsewhere throughout the region. On Friday, Khamenei called Soleimani a martyr and declared a three-day national mourning period for him and other senior officials killed in the airstrike. \"He was a stellar example of those educated and nurtured in Islam,\" Khamenei said in a statement Friday that also called for \"severe revenge.\" Soleimani led the Quds, which is designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. and was considered the most powerful intelligence operative in the Middle East, for more than two decades. He was behind the seizure of the Iraqi oil-rich city of Kirkuk from American-allied Kurdish forces in 2017. He helped negotiate for the Iraqi government and Shiite militias to take the city largely uncontested. It was viewed as an embarrassing strategic blow to the U.S. at the time. But Soleimani is also credited with fighting the Islamic State militant group in Iraq. In a 2017 public letter, he denounced the \"evil movement\" that managed \"to deceive tens of thousands of Muslim youth\" in Iraq and Syria, while also blaming the U.S. for the rise and spread of ISIS. Iran had launched airstrikes against ISIS fighters outside Baghdad in late 2014 just as the United States and its coalition partners were taking on the extremist group. ISIS, made up of Sunni extremists, was ideologically at odds with Soleimani and the Iranian Shiite regime he defended. Soleimani and his commanders were on the front lines in Iraq and his name became synonymous with victories attributed to Iraqi ground forces. He had presented himself as the face of the offensive in Tikrit, a city which fell under ISIS control in 2014. Iran sought to highlight his efforts against ISIS while protesting his death Friday. Zarif said the slain general had dedicated his life \"to fighting tyranny, oppression, terror and extremism.\" Reported to have been raised in poverty in the mountains of eastern Iran, Soleimani went from being a construction worker to climbing the ranks of Iran's military as a young man following the Islamic Revolution of 1979. He became known as a war hero and a patriot, risking his life to minimize casualties among his men in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, according to a 2011 American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research report. His track record includes support of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The United Nations had imposed an asset freeze and travel ban on him in 2007, and the U.S. sanctioned him again in response to his alleged involvement in the Syrian war in 2011. Long known as the \"shadow commander\" in Western media, his profile was raised in 2015 as Iranian outlets began releasing photos of him in the battlefield guiding the war against ISIS. His face was soon plastered on T-shirts and his name mentioned in Shiite music videos. His power was compared to that of a vice president.\n",
       "189  Soleimani funeral procession in Baghdad draws thousands of mourners chanting 'America is the Great Satan'  BAGHDAD (AP) — Thousands of mourners chanting “America is the Great Satan” marched in a funeral procession Saturday through Baghdad for Iran's top general and Iraqi militant leaders, who were killed in a U.S. airstrike. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds force and mastermind of its regional security strategy, was killed in an airstrike early Friday near the Iraqi capital's international airport that has caused regional tensions to soar. Iran has vowed harsh retaliation, raising fears of an all-outwar. U.S. President Donald Trump says he ordered the strike to prevent a conflict. His administration says Soleimani was plotting a series of attacks that endangered American troops and officials, without providing evidence. An official with the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq said it has scaled back operations and boosted “security and defensive measures” at bases hosting coalition forces in the country. The official spoke on condition of anonymity according to regulations. Washington has dispatched another 3,000 troops to neighboring Kuwait. MICHAEL PREGENT: TRUMP CONFRONTS IRAN WITH STRENGTH - OBAMA SHOWED WEAKNESS AND IRAN BECAME MORE DANGEROUS          Soleimani was the architect of Iran's regional policy of mobilizing militias across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, including in the war against the Islamic State group. He was also blamed for attacks on U.S. troops and American allies going back to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The mourners, mostly men in black military fatigues, carried Iraqi flags and the flags of Iran-backed militias that are fiercely loyal to Soleimani. They were also mourning Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a senior Iraqi militia commander who was killed in the same strike. SUSAN RICE SAYS OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 'DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY' TO KILL SOLEIMANI          The procession began at the Imam Kadhim shrine in Baghdad, one of the most revered sites in Shiite Islam. Mourners marched in the streets alongside militia vehicles in a solemn procession. The mourners, many of them in tears, chanted: \"No, No, America,\" and “Death to America, death to Israel.” Mohammed Fadl, a mourner dressed in black, said the funeral is an expression of loyalty to the slain leaders. “It is a painful strike, but it will not shake us,” he said. Two helicopters hovered over the procession, which was attended by Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and leaders of Iran-backed militias. The gates to Baghdad's Green Zone, which houses government offices and foreign embassies, including the U.S. Embassy, were closed. TUCKER CARLSON ON SOLEIMANI KILLING: 'THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF BAD PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD. WE CAN'T KILL THEM ALL'          Iraq, which is closely allied with both Washington and Tehran, condemned the airstrike that killed Soleimani and called it an attack on its national sovereignty. Parliament is to meet for an emergency session on Sunday, and the government has come under mounting pressure to expel the 5,200 American troops based in the country, who are there to help prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group. The U.S. has ordered all citizens to leave Iraq and closed its embassy in Baghdad, where Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters staged two days of violent protests earlier this week in which they breached the compound. The British government has warned travelers not to go anywhere in the country except for the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, and there only for trips considered essential. In its advisory, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the security situation “could deteriorate quickly.\" No one was hurt in the embassy protests, which came in response to U.S. airstrikes that killed 25 Iran-backed militiamen in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. said the strikes were in response to a rocket attack that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq, which Washington blamed on the militias. FORMER CIA DIRECTOR PREDICTS 'HIGH COST' FOR SOLEIMANI STRIKE: THERE WILL BE 'DEAD CIVILIAN AMERICANS'          Tensions between the U.S. and Iran have steadily intensified since Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal and restore crippling sanctions. The administration's “maximum pressure” campaign has led Iran to openly abandon commitments under the deal. The U.S. has also blamed Iran for a wave of increasingly provocative attacks in the region, including the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure in September that temporarily halved its production. Iran denied involvement in those attacks, but admitted to shooting down a U.S. surveillance drone in June that it said had strayed into its airspace. On Saturday, billboards appeared on major streets in Iran showing Soleimani and carrying the warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that “harsh revenge” awaits the US. Iranian state television also aired images of a ceremony honoring Soleimani at a mosque in the Shiite holy city of Qom, where a red flag was unfurled above the minarets. Red flags in Shiite tradition symbolize both blood spilled unjustly and serve as a call to avenge a person who is slain. US TO SEND 3,000 MORE TROOPS TO MIDDLE EAST FOLLOWING SOLEIMANI DEATH: OFFICIALS          Iranian President Hassan Rouhani visited Soleimani’s home in Tehran to express his condolences. “The Americans did not realize what a great mistake they made,” Rouhani said. “They will see the effects of this criminal act, not only today but for years to come.”          Global powers had warned Friday that the killing of Soleimani could spark a dangerous new escalation, with many calling for restraint. Iran’s state TV reported that Qatar’s foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, made an unplanned trip to Iran where he met with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. The Qatari diplomat was also set to meet with Rouhani. Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs, took to Twitter to reiterate the kingdom's call for \"self-restraint\" to avoid “unbearable consequences.”          Another Saudi official confirmed to The Associated Press that the U.S. did not give a heads-up to Saudi Arabia or its other Gulf allies before carrying out the strike that killed Soleimani. The official was not authorized to discuss security matters and so spoke on condition of anonymity. Illustrating Soleimani's regional reach, Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip, including the territory’s Hamas rulers, opened a mourning site for the slain general and dozens gathered to burn American and Israeli flags.\n",

Trump wrote on Twitter afterward that the U.S. had already “targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture.”          Trump did not identify the targets but added that they would be “HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.”          After thousands in Baghdad on Saturday mourned Soleimani and others killed in the strike, authorities flew the general’s body to the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. An honor guard stood by early Sunday as mourners carried the flag-draped coffins of Soleimani and other Guard members off the tarmac.          Officials brought Soleimani’s body to Ahvaz, a city that was a focus of fighting during the bloody, 1980-88 war between Iraq and Iran in which the general slowly grew to prominence. After that war, Soleimani joined the Guard’s newly formed Quds, or Jersualem, Force, an expeditionary force that works with Iranian proxy forces in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.          Authorities also plan to take Soleimani’s body to Mashhad later Sunday, as well as Tehran and Qom on Monday for public mourning processions, then onto his hometown of Kerman for burial Tuesday.          Soleimani was the architect of Iran’s regional policy of mobilizing militias across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, including in the war against the Islamic State group. He was also blamed for attacks on U.S. troops and American allies going back decades.          Though it’s unclear how or when Iran may respond, any retaliation was likely to come after three days of mourning declared in both Iran and Iraq. All eyes were on Iraq, where America and Iran have competed for influence since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.          After the airstrike early Friday, the U.S.-led coalition has scaled back operations and boosted “security and defensive measures” at bases hosting coalition forces in Iraq, a coalition official said on condition of anonymity according to regulations.          Meanwhile, the U.S. has dispatched another 3,000 troops to neighboring Kuwait, the latest in a series of deployments in recent months as the standoff with Iran has worsened. Protesters held demonstrations in dozens of U.S. cities Saturday over Trump’s decisions to kill Soleimani and deploy more troops to the Mideast.          In a thinly veiled threat, one of the Iran-backed militia, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, or League of the Righteous, called on Iraqi security forces to stay at least a kilometer (0.6 miles) away from U.S. bases starting Sunday night. However, U.S. troops are invariably based in Iraqi military posts alongside local forces.          Iraq’s government, which is closely allied with Iran, condemned the airstrike that killed Soleimani, calling it an attack on its national sovereignty. Parliament is meeting for an emergency session Sunday, and the government has come under mounting pressure to expel the 5,200 American troops who are based in the country to help prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group.          The U.S. has ordered all citizens to leave Iraq and temporarily closed its embassy in Baghdad, where Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters staged two days of violent protests in which they breached the compound. Britain and France have warned their citizens to avoid or strictly limit travel in Iraq.

Despite the fact the entire brigade was put on alert, the official said the most likely deployment would be a rifle company or a battalion, somewhere between 130 to 750 total troops.          Targets in Syria that were under imminent threat included military outposts the U.S. maintains in the eastern part of the country, current and former officials said. In Lebanon, Soleimani was allegedly planning attacks on diplomatic and financial targets, they said.          \"He was actively plotting in the region to take actions — big action as he described it - that would have put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview on CNN. A U.S. drone strike that killed Soleimani Thursday in Baghdad stopped an \"imminent attack\" against Americans that Soleimani was actively working to implement, Pompeo said.          A senior U.S. official said recently Soleimani traveled to Syria, Lebanon and then to Iraq Thursday, and U.S. intelligence officials believe he was approving final plans for attacks in each location.          Administration officials were expected to brief lawmakers on the operation. So far the administration has declined to provide details publicly of the intelligence assessment that prompted the strike against Soleimani.          Members of Congress have expressed concern about retaliation from Iran, which its leadership has said it will take. Democrats in particular have expressed concern that Trump's authorization of a strike against Soleimani will escalate to a full-blown war with Iran, and they've demanded details of the \"imminent\" threat.          The National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

       "      <td>Donald Trump has claimed Joe Biden is “against God” in an attack on the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate’s faith.          In provocative remarks during a trip to Ohio, a key election battleground, the US president said Biden was “following the radical left agenda”.          Trump added: “Take away your guns, destroy your second amendment. No religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God.          “He’s against God, he’s against guns, he’s against energy, our kind of energy.”          Biden, who is leading in the polls, has frequently spoken about how his Catholic faith helped him cope with the deaths of his first wife and daughter in a 1972 car accident.          In a statement, he said Trump’s comments were “shameful”.          He added: “Like so many people, my faith has been the bedrock foundation of my life: it’s provided me comfort in moments of loss and tragedy, it’s kept me grounded and humbled in times of triumph and joy.          “And in this moment of darkness for our country – of pain, of division, and of sickness for so many Americans – my faith has been a guiding light for me and a constant reminder of the fundamental dignity and humanity that God has bestowed upon all of us.          “For President Trump to attack my faith is shameful. It’s beneath the office he holds and it’s beneath the dignity the American people so rightly expect and deserve from their leaders.”          Biden’s stance on abortion has antagonised many of his fellow Catholics. In 1973, he said the Roe v Wade supreme court decision went “too far”, but now believes Roe v Wade is “the law of the land, a woman has a right to choose”.          Biden is dealing with a controversy of his own, after suggesting the African American community was homogenous – a comment Trump described as “very insulting”.          Biden said: “What you all know but most people don’t know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”          He later tweeted: “Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith – not by identity, not on issues, not at all.          “My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Opinion | A Biden Presidency Could Be Better Than Progressives Think</td>\n",
       "      <td>Biden wouldn’t need to pivot so dramatically to be a transformative progressive president. There are plenty of bleak moments in his record, including his treatment of Anita Hill and his Iraq war vote, but it’s not quite as reactionary as leftists sometimes imagine. Among other things, he’s long been better-than-average on unions; as Jared Bernstein, Biden’s former chief economist, told me, “One of the main things that differentiates Biden from a traditional mainstream Democrat is his understanding of the importance of worker power.”          Still, it’s clear that he’s moving leftward. Biden recently came out for tuition-free college for students whose families earn less than $125,000. He endorsed Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy plan, something that would have been unimaginable in 2005, when Warren, then a Harvard law professor, charged onto the public stage to fight a regressive bankruptcy bill that Biden supported.          After long supporting the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions, Biden gave in to pro-choice pressure to come out against it. His climate plan already went beyond any of Barack Obama’s initiatives, and he’s pledged to make it even more robust. Biden’s health care proposal falls far short of single-payer, but it is, as Paul Waldman wrote in The Washington Post, “surprisingly liberal.”          It will be in Biden’s political interests to try to make good on these commitments. “I’ve worked with him for a while now,” said Jared Bernstein. “He really believes you achieve political success by either doing what you’ve promised to do or getting caught trying like hell.”          In the 20th century, the two presidents with the most substantive records of progressive accomplishment were Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. Liberals nearly revolted on the Democratic convention floor when John F. Kennedy, looking to placate Southern voters, chose Johnson, but he ended up doing far more for liberalism than Kennedy did.          Roosevelt’s future greatness wasn’t obvious to all when he first ran for president. Sounding some of the same notes as Biden’s critics today, the famous political columnist Walter Lippmann wrote: “He is no tribune of the people. He is no enemy of entrenched privilege. He is a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the office, would very much like to be president.”          It may be too much to hope that Biden could equal the achievements of Roosevelt or Johnson. But should he become president, he will, like both of them, inherit a country deep in crisis, where once inconceivable political interventions suddenly appear possible. We can’t know whether he will rise to the opportunity — only that presidencies are shaped by far more than the ideology of the person who achieves the office.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Michigan Gov. Whitmer met with Biden as running mate announcement nears</td>\n",
       "      <td>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer traveled to Delaware last weekend for a private meeting with former Vice President and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, two Democratic officials confirmed to medianame News. News of the meeting was first reported earlier Friday by The Associated Press, which said that the meeting was Biden's first known in-person session with a potential running mate. The meeting lasted several hours, one of the two Democratic officials who confirmed the meeting said. Biden had said he planned to make an announcement the first week in August, but aides later said that was unlikely. Whitmer declined to comment when asked about the meeting. On Thursday, medianame News reported that Whitmer was among those still under serious consideration. Democrats with knowledge of the process have said Whitmer did not recently re-emerge as a potential vice presidential pick but had long remained in Biden’s top tier. Public speculation of a possible pick has also centered around Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., former national security adviser Susan Rice and Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also in the running. Michigan is a battleground state, and President Donald Trump narrowly won it in the 2016 election by around 10,700 votes. Whitmer has earned the respect of Biden officials for her role in responding to the coronavirus pandemic — at times in the face of protests that included demonstrations outside the state capitol building in which some protesters were armed, and a tweet by Trump that read \"Liberate Michigan!\" in capital letters. She elevated her public profile earlier this year by battling with Trump over the federal response to the pandemic. Senior Biden campaign officials have made clear again in recent days that they believe the COVID-19 pandemic combined with Trump’s management of the crisis and the resulting economic fallout is the central issue of the fall campaign.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Biden on Ditching Filibuster: Depends How 'Obstreperous' GOP Becomes</td>\n",
       "      <td>Joe Biden is refusing to rule out scrapping the Senate filibuster, arguing it remains to be seen how “obstreperous” Republicans will be after President Donald Trump leaves office.          The former vice president, who spent a majority of his nearly 40-year political career in the United States Senate, made the remarks on Monday in an interview with several prominent media outlets. Biden, in particular, claimed that while he had “not supported the elimination of the filibuster” in the past, a wait-and-see approach was needed until it was clear how Republicans would act in the post-Trump era.          “I think it’s gonna depend on how obstreperous [Republicans] become,” the former vice president told reporters, as noted by the Washington Post. Biden clarified that he was not necessarily expressing support in one direction or the other. “But I think you’re going to just have to take a look at it.”          The presumptive Democrat nominee added that he was optimistic that his administration would be able to forge a bipartisan consensus among congressional lawmakers, especially if his party were to win the Senate majority.          “I think I have a pretty good record of being able to pull together Democrats and Republicans,” Biden said, further noting that his long tenure in Congress made him “fairly good at understanding what the limitations of a senator [are] and trying to figure out how you help them.”          Biden’s comments on the topic come as a cadre of Democrat lawmakers are in talks to abolish the filibuster, which requires a three-fifths supermajority—usually 60 votes—to end debate on legislation in the Senate. The proposal, still in the early stages, is contingent upon Democrats winning both the White House and the Senate majority this November.          Even though no definitive agreement has been reached, a surprising number of lawmakers, including moderate Democrats, have expressed openness to either discarding or reforming the filibuster in recent weeks. Most notably, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Chris Coons (D-DE) have floated the idea as a way to prevent Republicans from obstructing Biden’s political agenda, provided the presumptive Democrat nominee wins.          “I will not stand idly by for four years and watch the Biden administration’s initiatives blocked at every turn,” Coons, a top congressional ally of the former vice president, said last month.          Progressive Democrats have argued that the filibuster is undemocratic as it allows a minority of lawmakers—at times even only one lawmaker—to hold up legislation favored by a majority of the Senate’s members. As neither party has held a supermajority within the chamber in recent years, bills without broad bipartisan support have gained little traction.          Some progressives, including Biden’s onetime rival and now potential running mate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) favor scrapping the rule in order to advance controversial legislation on topics such as gun control or abortion. Moderates, on the other hand, have defended the filibuster, claiming the limitation it imposed on majority rule was the “entire premise of the Senate” in the first place.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Former Vice President Joe Biden backtracked Saturday after first saying he wouldn’t comply with a Senate subpoena amid President Donald Trump’s trial, noting he would comply with the request.          Biden doubled down Friday on an earlier comment that he would not comply with a possible Senate subpoena. The 2020 presidential candidate tried to clarify his remarks Saturday on Twitter, writing that there would be no “legal basis” for the subpoena.          He later added that he would, in fact, comply if such a request came about, despite originally saying he would reject it.          “I would obey any subpoena that was sent to me,” Biden said Saturday during a town-hall style event in Iowa, the New York Times reported.          Biden’s drastic turn on complying with a subpoena is not the first time he has flip-flopped on an issue. After decades of supporting the death penalty, he tweeted in July that he now wants to “eliminate” it.          Biden also changed his position on the Hyde Amendment after backlash from members of the Democratic party in June. (‘If He’d Take It, Yes’: Biden Open To Nominating Obama For Supreme Court)          The former vice president criticized himself for answering the Senate subpoena question in the first place. He said that “This is going to be the news today” and noted he “shouldn’t even have answered the question.”          “I shouldn’t even have answered the question,” Biden said according to the NYT. “Because in answering the question, now there’s going to be another round. We’re not talking about: What did Trump do?”</td>\n",

       "55   Joe Biden attacks Donald Trump for 'shameful' claim he is 'against God'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Donald Trump has claimed Joe Biden is “against God” in an attack on the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate’s faith.          In provocative remarks during a trip to Ohio, a key election battleground, the US president said Biden was “following the radical left agenda”.          Trump added: “Take away your guns, destroy your second amendment. No religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God.          “He’s against God, he’s against guns, he’s against energy, our kind of energy.”          Biden, who is leading in the polls, has frequently spoken about how his Catholic faith helped him cope with the deaths of his first wife and daughter in a 1972 car accident.          In a statement, he said Trump’s comments were “shameful”.          He added: “Like so many people, my faith has been the bedrock foundation of my life: it’s provided me comfort in moments of loss and tragedy, it’s kept me grounded and humbled in times of triumph and joy.          “And in this moment of darkness for our country – of pain, of division, and of sickness for so many Americans – my faith has been a guiding light for me and a constant reminder of the fundamental dignity and humanity that God has bestowed upon all of us.          “For President Trump to attack my faith is shameful. It’s beneath the office he holds and it’s beneath the dignity the American people so rightly expect and deserve from their leaders.”          Biden’s stance on abortion has antagonised many of his fellow Catholics. In 1973, he said the Roe v Wade supreme court decision went “too far”, but now believes Roe v Wade is “the law of the land, a woman has a right to choose”.          Biden is dealing with a controversy of his own, after suggesting the African American community was homogenous – a comment Trump described as “very insulting”.          Biden said: “What you all know but most people don’t know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”          He later tweeted: “Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith – not by identity, not on issues, not at all.          “My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future.”\n",
       "141     Opinion | A Biden Presidency Could Be Better Than Progressives Think                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Biden wouldn’t need to pivot so dramatically to be a transformative progressive president. There are plenty of bleak moments in his record, including his treatment of Anita Hill and his Iraq war vote, but it’s not quite as reactionary as leftists sometimes imagine. Among other things, he’s long been better-than-average on unions; as Jared Bernstein, Biden’s former chief economist, told me, “One of the main things that differentiates Biden from a traditional mainstream Democrat is his understanding of the importance of worker power.”          Still, it’s clear that he’s moving leftward. Biden recently came out for tuition-free college for students whose families earn less than $125,000. He endorsed Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy plan, something that would have been unimaginable in 2005, when Warren, then a Harvard law professor, charged onto the public stage to fight a regressive bankruptcy bill that Biden supported.          After long supporting the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions, Biden gave in to pro-choice pressure to come out against it. His climate plan already went beyond any of Barack Obama’s initiatives, and he’s pledged to make it even more robust. Biden’s health care proposal falls far short of single-payer, but it is, as Paul Waldman wrote in The Washington Post, “surprisingly liberal.”          It will be in Biden’s political interests to try to make good on these commitments. “I’ve worked with him for a while now,” said Jared Bernstein. “He really believes you achieve political success by either doing what you’ve promised to do or getting caught trying like hell.”          In the 20th century, the two presidents with the most substantive records of progressive accomplishment were Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. Liberals nearly revolted on the Democratic convention floor when John F. Kennedy, looking to placate Southern voters, chose Johnson, but he ended up doing far more for liberalism than Kennedy did.          Roosevelt’s future greatness wasn’t obvious to all when he first ran for president. Sounding some of the same notes as Biden’s critics today, the famous political columnist Walter Lippmann wrote: “He is no tribune of the people. He is no enemy of entrenched privilege. He is a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the office, would very much like to be president.”          It may be too much to hope that Biden could equal the achievements of Roosevelt or Johnson. But should he become president, he will, like both of them, inherit a country deep in crisis, where once inconceivable political interventions suddenly appear possible. We can’t know whether he will rise to the opportunity — only that presidencies are shaped by far more than the ideology of the person who achieves the office.\n",

Gretchen Whitmer traveled to Delaware last weekend for a private meeting with former Vice President and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, two Democratic officials confirmed to medianame News. News of the meeting was first reported earlier Friday by The Associated Press, which said that the meeting was Biden's first known in-person session with a potential running mate. The meeting lasted several hours, one of the two Democratic officials who confirmed the meeting said. Biden had said he planned to make an announcement the first week in August, but aides later said that was unlikely. Whitmer declined to comment when asked about the meeting. On Thursday, medianame News reported that Whitmer was among those still under serious consideration. Democrats with knowledge of the process have said Whitmer did not recently re-emerge as a potential vice presidential pick but had long remained in Biden’s top tier. Public speculation of a possible pick has also centered around Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., former national security adviser Susan Rice and Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also in the running. Michigan is a battleground state, and President Donald Trump narrowly won it in the 2016 election by around 10,700 votes. Whitmer has earned the respect of Biden officials for her role in responding to the coronavirus pandemic — at times in the face of protests that included demonstrations outside the state capitol building in which some protesters were armed, and a tweet by Trump that read \"Liberate Michigan!\" in capital letters. She elevated her public profile earlier this year by battling with Trump over the federal response to the pandemic. Senior Biden campaign officials have made clear again in recent days that they believe the COVID-19 pandemic combined with Trump’s management of the crisis and the resulting economic fallout is the central issue of the fall campaign.\n",
       "215     Biden on Ditching Filibuster: Depends How 'Obstreperous' GOP Becomes  Joe Biden is refusing to rule out scrapping the Senate filibuster, arguing it remains to be seen how “obstreperous” Republicans will be after President Donald Trump leaves office.          The former vice president, who spent a majority of his nearly 40-year political career in the United States Senate, made the remarks on Monday in an interview with several prominent media outlets. Biden, in particular, claimed that while he had “not supported the elimination of the filibuster” in the past, a wait-and-see approach was needed until it was clear how Republicans would act in the post-Trump era.          “I think it’s gonna depend on how obstreperous [Republicans] become,” the former vice president told reporters, as noted by the Washington Post. Biden clarified that he was not necessarily expressing support in one direction or the other. “But I think you’re going to just have to take a look at it.”          The presumptive Democrat nominee added that he was optimistic that his administration would be able to forge a bipartisan consensus among congressional lawmakers, especially if his party were to win the Senate majority.          “I think I have a pretty good record of being able to pull together Democrats and Republicans,” Biden said, further noting that his long tenure in Congress made him “fairly good at understanding what the limitations of a senator [are] and trying to figure out how you help them.”          Biden’s comments on the topic come as a cadre of Democrat lawmakers are in talks to abolish the filibuster, which requires a three-fifths supermajority—usually 60 votes—to end debate on legislation in the Senate. The proposal, still in the early stages, is contingent upon Democrats winning both the White House and the Senate majority this November.          Even though no definitive agreement has been reached, a surprising number of lawmakers, including moderate Democrats, have expressed openness to either discarding or reforming the filibuster in recent weeks. Most notably, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Chris Coons (D-DE) have floated the idea as a way to prevent Republicans from obstructing Biden’s political agenda, provided the presumptive Democrat nominee wins.          “I will not stand idly by for four years and watch the Biden administration’s initiatives blocked at every turn,” Coons, a top congressional ally of the former vice president, said last month.          Progressive Democrats have argued that the filibuster is undemocratic as it allows a minority of lawmakers—at times even only one lawmaker—to hold up legislation favored by a majority of the Senate’s members. As neither party has held a supermajority within the chamber in recent years, bills without broad bipartisan support have gained little traction.          Some progressives, including Biden’s onetime rival and now potential running mate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) favor scrapping the rule in order to advance controversial legislation on topics such as gun control or abortion. Moderates, on the other hand, have defended the filibuster, claiming the limitation it imposed on majority rule was the “entire premise of the Senate” in the first place.\n",

Biden doubled down Friday on an earlier comment that he would not comply with a possible Senate subpoena. The 2020 presidential candidate tried to clarify his remarks Saturday on Twitter, writing that there would be no “legal basis” for the subpoena.          He later added that he would, in fact, comply if such a request came about, despite originally saying he would reject it.          “I would obey any subpoena that was sent to me,” Biden said Saturday during a town-hall style event in Iowa, the New York Times reported.          Biden’s drastic turn on complying with a subpoena is not the first time he has flip-flopped on an issue. After decades of supporting the death penalty, he tweeted in July that he now wants to “eliminate” it.          Biden also changed his position on the Hyde Amendment after backlash from members of the Democratic party in June. (‘If He’d Take It, Yes’: Biden Open To Nominating Obama For Supreme Court)          The former vice president criticized himself for answering the Senate subpoena question in the first place. He said that “This is going to be the news today” and noted he “shouldn’t even have answered the question.”          “I shouldn’t even have answered the question,” Biden said according to the NYT. “Because in answering the question, now there’s going to be another round. We’re not talking about: What did Trump do?”"

       "      <td>South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham appears to be changing his tune on his longtime friend former Vice President Joe Biden as he pushes ahead with his own probe of Biden's dealings with Ukraine. In a new letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the Senate Judiciary chair requested documents related to contacts between Vice President Biden, his son Hunter Biden, other Obama administration officials and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.     • All documents and communications, including call transcripts or summaries, related to the Vice President's phone calls with President Poroshenko on February 11, 18, and 19 and March 22 of 2016, especially with respect to whether Vice President Biden mentioned the Prosecutor General's investigation into Burisma.     • All documents and communications between the Vice President and his office and President Poroshenko and his office after the raid on Mr. Zlochevsky's home on February 2, 2016, until the dismissal of the Prosecutor General on March 29, 2016.     • All documents and communications related to a meeting between Devon Archer, a business partner of Hunter Biden, and Secretary of State John Kerry on March 2, 2016.          While it's not immediately clear if the State Department will comply with Graham's requests, it's part of a full press toward defending President Trump amid the ongoing impeachment probe into a quid pro quo arrangement to carry out investigations of Biden and Burisma -- Ukrainian energy company which Hunter Biden sits on the board of -- as well as Ukraine's involvement in the 2016 election.          As the first phase of the public impeachment probe came to a close Thursday after two weeks of witness testimony, the noted Trump ally decried the House impeachment inquiry into Trump as \"a joke\" but said it is \"a war worth fighting.\"          But Graham's about face on Biden and his connections to Ukraine comes as a bit of a surprise as the Republican has frequently gone to bat for his former Senate colleague. During several of his most recent appearances on medianame News' \"Face the Nation\", Graham has described Biden as \"honorable\" and a \"good man.\"          \"He's a good man. I like him a lot. I disagree with him on policy. But I hope he doesn't apologize for the life he's led because he's led a good life,\" Graham said back in April.          He followed up in June: \"I think you will underestimate Joe Biden at your own peril.\"          Graham also notably suggested on \"Face the Nation\" in September that he would not want to be the one carrying out a probe of Biden and his connection to the Trump impeachment saga, telling moderator reportername,\"A lot of Republicans don't believe the New Yorker and the political fact-checkers are really as adequate substitute...due to Joe Biden's scenario, what you did for Trump, find somebody, not me, outside of politics to look and see if it makes sense.\"          He added, \"I love Joe Biden as a person, but we cannot give Democrats a pass and go after Republicans.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Senate panel postpones subpoena vote in Hunter Biden probe</td>\n",
       "      <td>WASHINGTON — A Republican-led Senate committee has postponed a subpoena vote as part of its investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, though the chairman of the panel says the probe related to the Democratic presidential front-runner will move forward.          The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee scrapped a vote Wednesday on a subpoena to interview and obtain documents from a witness in the panel’s probe of Burisma, a gas company in Ukraine that paid Hunter Biden to serve as a board member. The subject of the subpoena, Andrii Telizhenko, was a consultant to a lobbying firm that worked with Burisma.          In a note to committee members, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said the committee will instead subpoena the lobbying firm, Blue Star Strategies, directly to obtain the documents.          There is no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens, and Hunter Biden has denied using his influence with his father to aid Burisma. But Republicans coming to President Donald Trump’s defense during and after last year’s impeachment trial have encouraged investigations of Hunter Biden’s activities, questioning whether they created a conflict of interest for Joe Biden as the former vice president worked on Ukraine policy in the Obama administration. Democrats say the investigations are politically motivated and designed to hurt Biden in his presidential run.          In the note to members before the scheduled vote, Johnson said there had been bipartisan meetings on the subject and the vote on the Telizhenko subpoena would be postponed “out of an abundance of caution, and to allow time for you to receive additional briefings.”          At the meeting that had been previously scheduled to consider the subpoena, Johnson told members that the panel will still be moving forward with the investigation, but “in this setting, the less said the better … in this setting, I’d rather not get into it.”          As Democrats have criticized the probe, Johnson has insisted his committee’s investigation is not political. He said last month that “the American people have a right to know how their government officials conducted official business, whether certain parties received special treatment, and whether any apparent or actual conflict of interest unduly influenced U.S. policy.”          Johnson pointed to letters he wrote the top Democrat on the panel, Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, in February on his intent to pursue the probe, which was before Biden won several states on Super Tuesday and revived his candidacy.          Trump, though, has been clear about his intentions. Asked about investigations into the Bidens on Fox News last week, Trump said it will be a “major issue” in the campaign. “I will bring that up all the time,” he said.          Trump’s efforts to have Ukraine investigate Hunter Biden’s role as a board member for Burisma were at the heart of House Democrats’ impeachment probe last year. He asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens on a July phone call that was revealed by a whistleblower’s complaint last fall.          The House impeached Trump in December for pressuring the Ukrainian government while withholding military aid to the country. The Senate acquitted him in February.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sen. Ron Johnson denies getting dirt on Biden from Ukrainian lawmaker, blasts Blumenthal for 'twisting' classified briefings</td>\n",
       "      <td>Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., is hitting back against a scathing op-ed in the Washington Post by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., arguing that he never received documents relating to Joe Biden’s family nor did the CIA refuse to brief him on the matter. In a lengthy thread on Twitter, Johnson denied Blumenthal’s claims that he received documents relating to Joe Biden and his son's activities in Ukraine from the son of a former Soviet intelligence agent and blasted the Connecticut Democrat for his “twisting of classified briefings and repeating of false news reports.”          “[Blumenthal’s] twisting of classified briefings and repeating of false news reports is beyond the pale,” Johnson tweeted. “It is a flat-out lie that I received the documents from Ukrainians that Democrats keep claiming. And they know it. It is unconscionable that Democrats and the press continue to report it.”          Johnson’s Twitter screed continued: “It is a flat-out lie that I asked for the CIA to brief our committee and that they refused. We’ve already been briefed repeatedly on these issues, Democrats simply didn’t like what they heard.”          In his op-ed on Friday, Blumenthal suggested that Johnson, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, may be using Russian disinformation to move ahead with his investigation into Biden’s family. Blumenthal cites a report from last week that says Johnson had been provided with tapes by Andrii Derkach, a Ukrainian lawmaker whose father was a KGB agent. Derkach has been active in leveling unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Biden and his son Hunter, who used to sit on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company. That effort has included publicizing leaked phone calls. “Johnson’s actions are of such concern to the CIA, according to news reports, that the agency has refused to brief him,” Blumenthal wrote. “Think of it: Congress may become a forum for debunked conspiracy theories peddled by Kremlin proxies.”          MARIE YOVANOVITCH, FORMER UKRAINE AMBASSADOR RECALLED BY TRUMP, IS RETIRING FROM STATE DEPARTMENT          He added: “There is no excuse for perpetuating Russian disinformation in the U.S. Senate, just as there is no excuse for barring the American public from learning more about the genuine foreign threats to the November election. The Trump administration appears to be failing to take the danger seriously, failing to prepare adequately.”          The senatorial spat comes just days after the U.S. counterintelligence chief said that officials believe that Russia is using a variety of measures to denigrate Biden ahead of the November election and that individuals linked to the Kremlin are boosting Trump’s reelection bid. The statement Friday from William Evanina is believed to be the most pointed declaration by the U.S. intelligence community linking the Kremlin to efforts to get Trump reelected — a sensitive subject for a president who has rejected intelligence agency assessments that Russia tried to help him in 2016. It also connects Moscow’s disapproval of Biden to his role as vice president in shaping Obama administration policies supporting Ukraine, an important U.S. ally, and opposing Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Asked about the intelligence assessment Friday evening in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump appeared to dispute the idea that Russia was disparaging Biden. “I think the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump because nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have — ever,” he said. Concerns about election interference are especially acute following a wide-ranging effort by Russia to meddle in the 2016 election on Trump’s behalf through both the hacking of Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord among U.S. voters. Trump has routinely resisted the idea that the Kremlin favored him in 2016, but the intelligence assessment released Friday indicates that unnamed Kremlin-linked actors are again working to boost his candidacy on social media and Russian television. ... Joe Biden, on the other hand, has led the fight against foreign interference for years.”          Democrats in Congress who have participated in recent classified briefings on election interference have expressed alarm at what they have heard. They have urged the U.S. intelligence community to make public some of their concerns in part to avoid a repeat of 2016, when Obama administration officials were seen as slow and overly deliberate in their public discussion of active Russian measures in that year’s election.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trump slams media as 'crooked as hell' amid Ukraine phone call controversy</td>\n",
       "      <td>President Trump did not mince words on Monday when voicing his feelings toward the media’s coverage of reports that the president pressured Ukraine's leader to help investigate political rival Joe Biden. Calling the White House press corps “crooked as hell,” a riled up Trump slammed the media for “double standards” over what he claimed was the failure of the press to report on allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing by Biden and his son, Hunter, related to dealings with Kyiv. “Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn’t want to report because they’re Democrats,” Trump said in New York during United Nations meetings. “If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair.”          Trump added: Look at the double standards, you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves…You got a lot of crooked journalists, you’re crooked as hell.”          The president’s heated comments came as congressional Democrats are pressing for a full disclosure of a whistleblower's complaint about Trump’s phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump acknowledged Monday that he didn't want to give money to Ukraine if there were corruption issues. His comments raised further questions about whether he improperly used his office to pressure the country into investigating the former vice president and his family. \"It's very important to talk about corruption,\" Trump told reporters as he opened meetings at the United Nations. \"If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is, is corrupt?\" Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son. The matter is under new scrutiny following the whistleblower's mid-August complaint, which followed Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The person who filed the complaint did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, according to a person familiar with the matter. Lawmakers are demanding details of the complaint, but the acting director of national intelligence has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. Trump hinted on Monday that he may release the details of the phone conversation, but said its contents mainly consisted of congratulating the new Ukrainian leader.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Biden calls Trump 'unhinged' as president lashes out on Twitter</td>\n",
       "      <td>Former Vice President Joe Biden took a shot at President Trump on Sunday, calling him “unhinged” amid Trump’s response to the impeachment inquiry and the president’s own allegations of wrongdoing by Biden and his son. Speaking at a Service Employees International Union (SEIU) summit, the 2020 presidential primary contender continued his strategy of pushing back against Trump’s allegations and what his campaign has called the president’s “unprecedented abuse of power.”          \"Have you ever seen -- rhetorical question -- a president ever so unhinged as this guy is?\" the Democrat asked Sunday. While Biden and Trump have been at odds long before the former vice president entered the 2020 presidential race, the animosity between the two has heated following the whistleblower complaint that claimed Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, and threatened to withhold military aid if the Ukrainians did not follow through. TRUMP FIRES BROADSIDE AT 'PILLAGING' BIDENS, CLAIMS UKRAINE PUSH WAS ONLY ABOUT 'CORRUPTION'          Trump has accused Hunter Biden of improper activity related to his business dealings with energy company Burisma Holdings and claimed his father used his office to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing top prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma. The former vice president has acknowledged publicly that he pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin but denied it had any relation to his son’s business dealings in the country. Biden said his actions were in line with pressure from other foreign leaders to fire the prosecutor. “We weren’t pressing Ukraine to get rid of a tough prosecutor. We were pursuing Ukraine to replace a weak prosecutor who wouldn’t do the job,” Biden said this past Wednesday of an Obama administration policy supported by other Western governments that viewed Shokin as incompetent or perhaps corrupt. The U.S. also had support internationally for its opposition to Shokin. Ukrainian officials, including Shokin’s successor, have said since that the Bidens were never implicated in any wrongdoing. Biden’s “unhinged” comment came amid a challenging weekend for the Trump administration as reports emerged that a second whistleblower – this one with firsthand knowledge of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky – has spoken to the intelligence community’s inspector general. The first whistleblower was subjected to criticism from Trump and his supporters based on an apparent lack of direct knowledge of the president’s conversation with Zelensky, as well as what Trump has called an inaccurate description of the call. The new whistleblower also faced the ire of Trump, who has been even more active on social media over the weekend than normal. Targets of his social-media attacks included House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah. “The first so-called second hand information “Whistleblower” got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another “Whistleblower” is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info, Trump tweeted. “Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming!”          Biden held a nine-point advantage over Trump in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, according to a medianame poll out Sunday. Bernie Sanders was up by five points over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren had a four-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters was enough to shift the race either way. Trump received 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he received when he won Wisconsin in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.</td>\n",

In a new letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the Senate Judiciary chair requested documents related to contacts between Vice President Biden, his son Hunter Biden, other Obama administration officials and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.     • All documents and communications, including call transcripts or summaries, related to the Vice President's phone calls with President Poroshenko on February 11, 18, and 19 and March 22 of 2016, especially with respect to whether Vice President Biden mentioned the Prosecutor General's investigation into Burisma.     • All documents and communications between the Vice President and his office and President Poroshenko and his office after the raid on Mr. Zlochevsky's home on February 2, 2016, until the dismissal of the Prosecutor General on March 29, 2016.     • All documents and communications related to a meeting between Devon Archer, a business partner of Hunter Biden, and Secretary of State John Kerry on March 2, 2016.          While it's not immediately clear if the State Department will comply with Graham's requests, it's part of a full press toward defending President Trump amid the ongoing impeachment probe into a quid pro quo arrangement to carry out investigations of Biden and Burisma -- Ukrainian energy company which Hunter Biden sits on the board of -- as well as Ukraine's involvement in the 2016 election.          As the first phase of the public impeachment probe came to a close Thursday after two weeks of witness testimony, the noted Trump ally decried the House impeachment inquiry into Trump as \"a joke\" but said it is \"a war worth fighting.\"          But Graham's about face on Biden and his connections to Ukraine comes as a bit of a surprise as the Republican has frequently gone to bat for his former Senate colleague. During several of his most recent appearances on medianame News' \"Face the Nation\", Graham has described Biden as \"honorable\" and a \"good man.\"          \"He's a good man. I like him a lot. I disagree with him on policy. But I hope he doesn't apologize for the life he's led because he's led a good life,\" Graham said back in April.          He followed up in June: \"I think you will underestimate Joe Biden at your own peril.\"          Graham also notably suggested on \"Face the Nation\" in September that he would not want to be the one carrying out a probe of Biden and his connection to the Trump impeachment saga, telling moderator reportername,\"A lot of Republicans don't believe the New Yorker and the political fact-checkers are really as adequate substitute...due to Joe Biden's scenario, what you did for Trump, find somebody, not me, outside of politics to look and see if it makes sense.\"          He added, \"I love Joe Biden as a person, but we cannot give Democrats a pass and go after Republicans.\"\n",

The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee scrapped a vote Wednesday on a subpoena to interview and obtain documents from a witness in the panel’s probe of Burisma, a gas company in Ukraine that paid Hunter Biden to serve as a board member. The subject of the subpoena, Andrii Telizhenko, was a consultant to a lobbying firm that worked with Burisma.          In a note to committee members, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said the committee will instead subpoena the lobbying firm, Blue Star Strategies, directly to obtain the documents.          There is no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens, and Hunter Biden has denied using his influence with his father to aid Burisma. But Republicans coming to President Donald Trump’s defense during and after last year’s impeachment trial have encouraged investigations of Hunter Biden’s activities, questioning whether they created a conflict of interest for Joe Biden as the former vice president worked on Ukraine policy in the Obama administration. Democrats say the investigations are politically motivated and designed to hurt Biden in his presidential run.          In the note to members before the scheduled vote, Johnson said there had been bipartisan meetings on the subject and the vote on the Telizhenko subpoena would be postponed “out of an abundance of caution, and to allow time for you to receive additional briefings.”          At the meeting that had been previously scheduled to consider the subpoena, Johnson told members that the panel will still be moving forward with the investigation, but “in this setting, the less said the better … in this setting, I’d rather not get into it.”          As Democrats have criticized the probe, Johnson has insisted his committee’s investigation is not political. He said last month that “the American people have a right to know how their government officials conducted official business, whether certain parties received special treatment, and whether any apparent or actual conflict of interest unduly influenced U.S. policy.”          Johnson pointed to letters he wrote the top Democrat on the panel, Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, in February on his intent to pursue the probe, which was before Biden won several states on Super Tuesday and revived his candidacy.          Trump, though, has been clear about his intentions. Asked about investigations into the Bidens on Fox News last week, Trump said it will be a “major issue” in the campaign. “I will bring that up all the time,” he said.          Trump’s efforts to have Ukraine investigate Hunter Biden’s role as a board member for Burisma were at the heart of House Democrats’ impeachment probe last year. He asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens on a July phone call that was revealed by a whistleblower’s complaint last fall.          The House impeached Trump in December for pressuring the Ukrainian government while withholding military aid to the country. The Senate acquitted him in February.\n",
       "414  Sen. Ron Johnson denies getting dirt on Biden from Ukrainian lawmaker, blasts Blumenthal for 'twisting' classified briefings  Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., is hitting back against a scathing op-ed in the Washington Post by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., arguing that he never received documents relating to Joe Biden’s family nor did the CIA refuse to brief him on the matter. In a lengthy thread on Twitter, Johnson denied Blumenthal’s claims that he received documents relating to Joe Biden and his son's activities in Ukraine from the son of a former Soviet intelligence agent and blasted the Connecticut Democrat for his “twisting of classified briefings and repeating of false news reports.”          “[Blumenthal’s] twisting of classified briefings and repeating of false news reports is beyond the pale,” Johnson tweeted. “It is a flat-out lie that I received the documents from Ukrainians that Democrats keep claiming. And they know it. It is unconscionable that Democrats and the press continue to report it.”          Johnson’s Twitter screed continued: “It is a flat-out lie that I asked for the CIA to brief our committee and that they refused. We’ve already been briefed repeatedly on these issues, Democrats simply didn’t like what they heard.”          In his op-ed on Friday, Blumenthal suggested that Johnson, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, may be using Russian disinformation to move ahead with his investigation into Biden’s family. Blumenthal cites a report from last week that says Johnson had been provided with tapes by Andrii Derkach, a Ukrainian lawmaker whose father was a KGB agent. Derkach has been active in leveling unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Biden and his son Hunter, who used to sit on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company. That effort has included publicizing leaked phone calls. “Johnson’s actions are of such concern to the CIA, according to news reports, that the agency has refused to brief him,” Blumenthal wrote. “Think of it: Congress may become a forum for debunked conspiracy theories peddled by Kremlin proxies.”          MARIE YOVANOVITCH, FORMER UKRAINE AMBASSADOR RECALLED BY TRUMP, IS RETIRING FROM STATE DEPARTMENT          He added: “There is no excuse for perpetuating Russian disinformation in the U.S. Senate, just as there is no excuse for barring the American public from learning more about the genuine foreign threats to the November election. The Trump administration appears to be failing to take the danger seriously, failing to prepare adequately.”          The senatorial spat comes just days after the U.S. counterintelligence chief said that officials believe that Russia is using a variety of measures to denigrate Biden ahead of the November election and that individuals linked to the Kremlin are boosting Trump’s reelection bid. The statement Friday from William Evanina is believed to be the most pointed declaration by the U.S. intelligence community linking the Kremlin to efforts to get Trump reelected — a sensitive subject for a president who has rejected intelligence agency assessments that Russia tried to help him in 2016. It also connects Moscow’s disapproval of Biden to his role as vice president in shaping Obama administration policies supporting Ukraine, an important U.S. ally, and opposing Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Asked about the intelligence assessment Friday evening in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump appeared to dispute the idea that Russia was disparaging Biden. “I think the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump because nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have — ever,” he said. Concerns about election interference are especially acute following a wide-ranging effort by Russia to meddle in the 2016 election on Trump’s behalf through both the hacking of Democratic emails and a covert social media campaign aimed at sowing discord among U.S. voters. Trump has routinely resisted the idea that the Kremlin favored him in 2016, but the intelligence assessment released Friday indicates that unnamed Kremlin-linked actors are again working to boost his candidacy on social media and Russian television. ... Joe Biden, on the other hand, has led the fight against foreign interference for years.”          Democrats in Congress who have participated in recent classified briefings on election interference have expressed alarm at what they have heard. They have urged the U.S. intelligence community to make public some of their concerns in part to avoid a repeat of 2016, when Obama administration officials were seen as slow and overly deliberate in their public discussion of active Russian measures in that year’s election.\n",

Calling the White House press corps “crooked as hell,” a riled up Trump slammed the media for “double standards” over what he claimed was the failure of the press to report on allegations of unsubstantiated wrongdoing by Biden and his son, Hunter, related to dealings with Kyiv. “Joe Biden and his son are corrupt, but the fake news doesn’t want to report because they’re Democrats,” Trump said in New York during United Nations meetings. “If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they’d be getting the electric chair.”          Trump added: Look at the double standards, you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves…You got a lot of crooked journalists, you’re crooked as hell.”          The president’s heated comments came as congressional Democrats are pressing for a full disclosure of a whistleblower's complaint about Trump’s phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump acknowledged Monday that he didn't want to give money to Ukraine if there were corruption issues. His comments raised further questions about whether he improperly used his office to pressure the country into investigating the former vice president and his family. \"It's very important to talk about corruption,\" Trump told reporters as he opened meetings at the United Nations. \"If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is, is corrupt?\" Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son. The matter is under new scrutiny following the whistleblower's mid-August complaint, which followed Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The person who filed the complaint did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, according to a person familiar with the matter. Lawmakers are demanding details of the complaint, but the acting director of national intelligence has refused to share that information, citing presidential privilege. Trump hinted on Monday that he may release the details of the phone conversation, but said its contents mainly consisted of congratulating the new Ukrainian leader.\n",

Speaking at a Service Employees International Union (SEIU) summit, the 2020 presidential primary contender continued his strategy of pushing back against Trump’s allegations and what his campaign has called the president’s “unprecedented abuse of power.”          \"Have you ever seen -- rhetorical question -- a president ever so unhinged as this guy is?\" the Democrat asked Sunday. While Biden and Trump have been at odds long before the former vice president entered the 2020 presidential race, the animosity between the two has heated following the whistleblower complaint that claimed Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, and threatened to withhold military aid if the Ukrainians did not follow through. TRUMP FIRES BROADSIDE AT 'PILLAGING' BIDENS, CLAIMS UKRAINE PUSH WAS ONLY ABOUT 'CORRUPTION'          Trump has accused Hunter Biden of improper activity related to his business dealings with energy company Burisma Holdings and claimed his father used his office to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing top prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma. The former vice president has acknowledged publicly that he pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin but denied it had any relation to his son’s business dealings in the country. Biden said his actions were in line with pressure from other foreign leaders to fire the prosecutor. “We weren’t pressing Ukraine to get rid of a tough prosecutor. We were pursuing Ukraine to replace a weak prosecutor who wouldn’t do the job,” Biden said this past Wednesday of an Obama administration policy supported by other Western governments that viewed Shokin as incompetent or perhaps corrupt. The U.S. also had support internationally for its opposition to Shokin. Ukrainian officials, including Shokin’s successor, have said since that the Bidens were never implicated in any wrongdoing. Biden’s “unhinged” comment came amid a challenging weekend for the Trump administration as reports emerged that a second whistleblower – this one with firsthand knowledge of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky – has spoken to the intelligence community’s inspector general. The first whistleblower was subjected to criticism from Trump and his supporters based on an apparent lack of direct knowledge of the president’s conversation with Zelensky, as well as what Trump has called an inaccurate description of the call. The new whistleblower also faced the ire of Trump, who has been even more active on social media over the weekend than normal. Targets of his social-media attacks included House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah. “The first so-called second hand information “Whistleblower” got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another “Whistleblower” is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info, Trump tweeted. “Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming!”          Biden held a nine-point advantage over Trump in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, according to a medianame poll out Sunday. Bernie Sanders was up by five points over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren had a four-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters was enough to shift the race either way. Trump received 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he received when he won Wisconsin in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent."

       "      <td>A poll released by Emerson College on Tuesday shows presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s lead over President Donald Trump has slipped to three points in the key battleground state of Minnesota.          The Emerson College poll of 733 likely registered voters in Minnesota was conducted between August 8 and 10, and has a margin of error of 3.6 percent, which means the contest between Biden and Trump in the state is currently a statistical tie.          The poll results continue the trend of momentum at both the national and battleground state level in the direction of President Trump, who has significantly narrowed the gap against Biden over the past three weeks.          President Trump narrowly lost Minnesota and its ten electoral college votes in the 2016 presidential election, garnering just 44,000 fewer votes than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.          Minnesota is ground zero of the Black Lives Matter inspired riots and protests that have swept the country since the death of George Floyd during his arrest by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department in May.          A new Emerson College Poll finds Minnesota is competitive again in 2020, with 50% of voters planning on supporting former VP Joe Biden and 47% intending to vote for President Trump. While the race is close, only 3% of voters remain undecided. Of voters who plan to vote by mail, 91% plan to vote for Biden, and of those who plan to vote in person, 68% plan to vote for Trump. President Trump’s approval rating amongst Minnesota voters is slightly underwater, with 46% approval, and 51% disapprove of his job performance, with 3% remaining neutral. Among independent voters, Trump’s approval is at 45% approval, and 47% disapproval. First-term Governor Tim Walz has a more favorable view, with 50% approving of his job performance, 41% disapproving and 9% holding a neutral opinion on the Governor.          The poll also found that incumbent Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) leads former Congressman Jason Lewis (R-MN), who won the Republican primary on Tuesday, by a similar three point margin, 48 percent to 45 percent, which is within the poll’s margin of error.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont holds a 12-point lead over his nearest 2020 Democratic presidential rival in New Hampshire, according to a WBUR poll released on Thursday.          Mr. Sanders was the top choice of 29% of likely Democratic primary voters, followed by Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, at 17%, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden at 14%, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 13%, according to the poll.          “I wouldn’t take these numbers to the bank,” said Steve Koczela, president of the MassINC Polling Group, which conducted the poll. “But you’ve got to be feeling pretty good about where you stand right at this moment if you’re the Sanders campaign.”          Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota was next at 6%, followed by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 5% apiece. No other candidate topped 2% support.          In a WBUR poll released in December, Mr. Buttigieg had been in the lead with 18% support, followed by Mr. Biden at 17%, Mr. Sanders at 15% and Ms. Warren at 12%.          Mr. Sanders cruised to victory in New Hampshire in 2016 over Hillary Clinton, the eventual Democratic presidential nominee who went on to lose to President Trump in the general election.          The survey of 426 likely primary voters was taken from Jan. 17-21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This article has been updated to include the latest information. We’re just 100 days out from learning if we’ll see four more years of the most unexpected, unorthodox and unpredictable presidency in American history, or the last-shot victory of a career politician who will beat by almost a decade Trump’s record of being the oldest man to ever take the office. According to most of the national and state pollsters — about whom Americans have justifiably developed a healthy skepticism — the 77-year-old “Sleepy Joe” is on cruise control to finally bag the biggest prize in the world after two previous failed attempts. Working against Trump is the compounding effect of the nation’s two simultaneous crises: COVID-19 and widespread racial unrest, or as The New York Times’ Nikole Hannah-Jones says she’d be “honored” to call them, the “1619 Riots.” But there are some slight glimmers of hope for Trump buried in some of the data. According to RealClearPolitics’ average of the national polls, Trump has never led Biden in a head-to-head. For most of 2020, through mid-March, the gap between the two has been around 5%. But as the pandemic lockdowns began, the divide roughly doubled, reaching its peak of 10.2% on June 23, by which point the George Floyd-sparked protests and riots were in full swing. The gap has slightly diminished since but remains formidable. The most recent average of the polls finds Trump trailing Biden by 8.7 points (49.6–40.9), roughly the same as last week (8.6) and about a point better than late June. Two of three polls updated since last week found the gap between the candidates shrinking. YouGov’s poll conducted July 19-21 found Biden ahead by 7, a two-point decline since the previous week. Rasmussen also tracked a slight closing of the gap from 3 to 2 points from a week before. The Hill found the opposite, Biden building on his lead by 3 points to +7 from its previous survey results. While, as usual, Rasmussen gives Trump the best shot at a repeat of 2016 — in which he trailed Hillary Clinton by 3.3%, ended up losing the popular vote by 2.1%, but went on to easily defeat her in the Electoral College — Quinnipiac’s widely reported poll from last week found Trump trailing by a dismal 15 points. Both polls appear to be outliers, however, with multiple polls finding the gap to be between 7 to 10 points. Here is the breakdown from some of the major national polls that factor into the average, with the most recent at the top:     • The Hill — Biden +7 (45–38) was Biden +4 last week          Will Biden’s lead erode as so often happens as the election approaches? The Trump-critical New York Times says it may not. “The last time a candidate sustained such a large advantage for so long was nearly 25 years ago, when Bill Clinton led Bob Dole in 1996,” the Times noted this week. While the national polls can be helpful in trying to gauge widespread public sentiment and momentum, the election, of course, isn’t decided by the popular vote — the data that matters the most comes from the states. The problem is, as 2016 demonstrated, state polling is often more inaccurate due to less thorough information. Despite losing the popular vote by about 2%, Trump ultimately trounced Clinton in several key swing states, allowing him to rack up 304 electoral votes to her 227. Heading into election day, the state polls indicated that he’d lose by 6 electoral votes. Currently, Trump’s outlook on the state level isn’t good. In order to shock the world again, he’ll need many of the state polls to be wrong again. Here’s the current breakdown of key battleground states, according to RCP’s averages:     • Arizona — Biden +2.8 (same as last month) — 2016: Trump won by 3.6     • Florida — Biden +7 (up from +3.4) — 2016: Trump won by 1.2     • Iowa — Trump +1.5 (down from +4.6) — 2016: Trump won by 9.4     • Michigan — Biden +8.2 (up from +4.2) — 2016: Trump won by 0.2     • North Carolina — Biden +2 (up from +0.8) — 2016: Trump won by 3.6     • Pennsylvania — Biden +6.7 (up from +4) — 2016: Trump won by 1.7     • Texas — Trump +0.2 (down from +2.2) — 2016: Trump won by 9     • Wisconsin — Biden +5.5 (up from +3.4) — 2016: Trump won by 0.7          If Biden were to hold on to the states Clinton won in 2016 and win the states above in which he currently leads by 3% or more (FL, MI, PA and WI), he would secure 71 votes more than Clinton (25, 16, 20, and 10, respectively). Those 71 votes would win the election for Biden with about 30 votes to spare. For those looking for hope for Trump, here’s a postmortem on how much the state pollsters botched the 2016 election. Below is how the Electoral College map is shaping up 14 weeks out:          The betting odds have been trending in the same direction as the polls since the lockdowns: Biden gaining at Trump’s expense. Action Network gives Biden a 59.7% chance of winning and Trump 33.2%. Here’s the bettors’ odds including some longshot candidates, among them Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson — and Clinton, of course:          This article has been updated and expanded to include additional recent and relevant information.

       "      <td>(medianame) Poll of the week: A new medianame/SSRS poll finds that former Vice President Joe Biden leads in the state of Florida by a 51% to 46% margin over President Donald Trump among registered voters.          The fact that the polls in Florida favor Biden should be one of the biggest warning signs yet for Trump's fledgling campaign. Yes, we still have 100 days to go, and history does suggest that the gap in Florida could close.          Still, Florida is probably the bellwether state that most meets the definition of \"must win\" for Trump if he wants to be elected to a second term, and he is losing there.          Moreover, it's a state that leans a little bit to the right of the nation. The last time the state voted more Democratic than the nation as a whole in a presidential election was 1976. The fact that Trump is down here by an average of 8 points in high quality live interview polls since June 1 suggests he is down significantly nationally.          Biden, on the other hand, has a clear path to 270 electoral votes without Florida. Biden has held 6 to 12 point leads in polls released this week from Michigan and Pennsylvania. This includes 6 point and 12 point advantages in Michigan from CBS News/YouGov and medianame/SSRS polls respectively released on Sunday. High quality polls from June gave Biden an average 10-point lead in Wisconsin . If Biden adds all of those states to his column plus the 232 electoral votes from the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, he gets to 278 electoral votes.          Winning Florida gives Biden a lot of backup options given that it's worth 29 electoral votes. If Biden adds the 29 electoral votes from Florida to the states Clinton took in 2016, he gets 261 electoral votes. Biden would need just 9 electoral votes more to get an electoral college majority. He could add any other state that Trump won in 2016 by 9.0 points or less.          As I noted a few months ago , Florida is geographically and demographically diverse from the Great Lake battleground states. If Biden stumbles in the mostly White Great Lake swing states, he could conceivably hold onto Florida and add on the diverse swing state of Arizona. Biden has consistently been ahead in Arizona, and he was up 4 and 5 points in the latest medianame/SSRS and NBC News/Marist College polls out Sunday.          Additionally, Biden could just win one of those Great Lake battleground states and Florida to get to 270 electoral votes. Biden could, for example, add Michigan (16 electoral votes) to his column, and it would be enough. Biden has held the advantage in every single nonpartisan poll in Michigan since early March          every Perhaps as importantly for Democrats, the polling in Florida has generally been accurate at the end of the campaign. There hasn't been an error like there was in the Great Lakes in 2016. The final Florida polls from medianame have been within 3 points of the outcome in presidential election since 2008. The same holds true for the gubernatorial and Senate elections in 2018          With Biden's polling lead being as wide as it is right now in the Sunshine State, the past accuracy of the final polls suggest he really is ahead right now.          The good news for Trump is that history does indicate how difficult it would be for Biden to win the state by a large margin. The last time a Democrat won the state by more than 6 points was 1948 . No candidate from either party has won the state by more than 6 points since 1992.          Overall the point is that we shouldn't be surprised if the margin in Florida closes down the stretch. That's exactly what happened in the 2018 midterms, when Republican candidates for governor and Senate squeaked out wins by less than a point.          As I've said many times before, Trump likely can't win if he doesn't turn around his low approval ratings on the coronavirus. His approval rating in Florida on the issue is just 42% among registered voters in the latest medianame poll.</td>\n",

The Emerson College poll of 733 likely registered voters in Minnesota was conducted between August 8 and 10, and has a margin of error of 3.6 percent, which means the contest between Biden and Trump in the state is currently a statistical tie.          The poll results continue the trend of momentum at both the national and battleground state level in the direction of President Trump, who has significantly narrowed the gap against Biden over the past three weeks.          President Trump narrowly lost Minnesota and its ten electoral college votes in the 2016 presidential election, garnering just 44,000 fewer votes than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.          Minnesota is ground zero of the Black Lives Matter inspired riots and protests that have swept the country since the death of George Floyd during his arrest by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department in May.          A new Emerson College Poll finds Minnesota is competitive again in 2020, with 50% of voters planning on supporting former VP Joe Biden and 47% intending to vote for President Trump. While the race is close, only 3% of voters remain undecided. Of voters who plan to vote by mail, 91% plan to vote for Biden, and of those who plan to vote in person, 68% plan to vote for Trump. President Trump’s approval rating amongst Minnesota voters is slightly underwater, with 46% approval, and 51% disapprove of his job performance, with 3% remaining neutral. Among independent voters, Trump’s approval is at 45% approval, and 47% disapproval. First-term Governor Tim Walz has a more favorable view, with 50% approving of his job performance, 41% disapproving and 9% holding a neutral opinion on the Governor.          The poll also found that incumbent Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) leads former Congressman Jason Lewis (R-MN), who won the Republican primary on Tuesday, by a similar three point margin, 48 percent to 45 percent, which is within the poll’s margin of error.\n",

Bernard Sanders of Vermont holds a 12-point lead over his nearest 2020 Democratic presidential rival in New Hampshire, according to a WBUR poll released on Thursday.          Mr. Sanders was the top choice of 29% of likely Democratic primary voters, followed by Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, at 17%, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden at 14%, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 13%, according to the poll.          “I wouldn’t take these numbers to the bank,” said Steve Koczela, president of the MassINC Polling Group, which conducted the poll. “But you’ve got to be feeling pretty good about where you stand right at this moment if you’re the Sanders campaign.”          Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota was next at 6%, followed by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 5% apiece. No other candidate topped 2% support.          In a WBUR poll released in December, Mr. Buttigieg had been in the lead with 18% support, followed by Mr. Biden at 17%, Mr. Sanders at 15% and Ms. Warren at 12%.          Mr. Sanders cruised to victory in New Hampshire in 2016 over Hillary Clinton, the eventual Democratic presidential nominee who went on to lose to President Trump in the general election.          The survey of 426 likely primary voters was taken from Jan. 17-21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.\n",
       "311                                                Trump Vs. Biden: All The Latest Polls  This article has been updated to include the latest information. We’re just 100 days out from learning if we’ll see four more years of the most unexpected, unorthodox and unpredictable presidency in American history, or the last-shot victory of a career politician who will beat by almost a decade Trump’s record of being the oldest man to ever take the office. According to most of the national and state pollsters — about whom Americans have justifiably developed a healthy skepticism — the 77-year-old “Sleepy Joe” is on cruise control to finally bag the biggest prize in the world after two previous failed attempts. Working against Trump is the compounding effect of the nation’s two simultaneous crises: COVID-19 and widespread racial unrest, or as The New York Times’ Nikole Hannah-Jones says she’d be “honored” to call them, the “1619 Riots.” But there are some slight glimmers of hope for Trump buried in some of the data. According to RealClearPolitics’ average of the national polls, Trump has never led Biden in a head-to-head. For most of 2020, through mid-March, the gap between the two has been around 5%. But as the pandemic lockdowns began, the divide roughly doubled, reaching its peak of 10.2% on June 23, by which point the George Floyd-sparked protests and riots were in full swing. The gap has slightly diminished since but remains formidable. The most recent average of the polls finds Trump trailing Biden by 8.7 points (49.6–40.9), roughly the same as last week (8.6) and about a point better than late June. Two of three polls updated since last week found the gap between the candidates shrinking. YouGov’s poll conducted July 19-21 found Biden ahead by 7, a two-point decline since the previous week. Rasmussen also tracked a slight closing of the gap from 3 to 2 points from a week before. The Hill found the opposite, Biden building on his lead by 3 points to +7 from its previous survey results. While, as usual, Rasmussen gives Trump the best shot at a repeat of 2016 — in which he trailed Hillary Clinton by 3.3%, ended up losing the popular vote by 2.1%, but went on to easily defeat her in the Electoral College — Quinnipiac’s widely reported poll from last week found Trump trailing by a dismal 15 points. Both polls appear to be outliers, however, with multiple polls finding the gap to be between 7 to 10 points. Here is the breakdown from some of the major national polls that factor into the average, with the most recent at the top:     • The Hill — Biden +7 (45–38) was Biden +4 last week          Will Biden’s lead erode as so often happens as the election approaches? The Trump-critical New York Times says it may not. “The last time a candidate sustained such a large advantage for so long was nearly 25 years ago, when Bill Clinton led Bob Dole in 1996,” the Times noted this week. While the national polls can be helpful in trying to gauge widespread public sentiment and momentum, the election, of course, isn’t decided by the popular vote — the data that matters the most comes from the states. The problem is, as 2016 demonstrated, state polling is often more inaccurate due to less thorough information. Despite losing the popular vote by about 2%, Trump ultimately trounced Clinton in several key swing states, allowing him to rack up 304 electoral votes to her 227. Heading into election day, the state polls indicated that he’d lose by 6 electoral votes. Currently, Trump’s outlook on the state level isn’t good. In order to shock the world again, he’ll need many of the state polls to be wrong again. Here’s the current breakdown of key battleground states, according to RCP’s averages:     • Arizona — Biden +2.8 (same as last month) — 2016: Trump won by 3.6     • Florida — Biden +7 (up from +3.4) — 2016: Trump won by 1.2     • Iowa — Trump +1.5 (down from +4.6) — 2016: Trump won by 9.4     • Michigan — Biden +8.2 (up from +4.2) — 2016: Trump won by 0.2     • North Carolina — Biden +2 (up from +0.8) — 2016: Trump won by 3.6     • Pennsylvania — Biden +6.7 (up from +4) — 2016: Trump won by 1.7     • Texas — Trump +0.2 (down from +2.2) — 2016: Trump won by 9     • Wisconsin — Biden +5.5 (up from +3.4) — 2016: Trump won by 0.7          If Biden were to hold on to the states Clinton won in 2016 and win the states above in which he currently leads by 3% or more (FL, MI, PA and WI), he would secure 71 votes more than Clinton (25, 16, 20, and 10, respectively). Those 71 votes would win the election for Biden with about 30 votes to spare. For those looking for hope for Trump, here’s a postmortem on how much the state pollsters botched the 2016 election. Below is how the Electoral College map is shaping up 14 weeks out:          The betting odds have been trending in the same direction as the polls since the lockdowns: Biden gaining at Trump’s expense. Action Network gives Biden a 59.7% chance of winning and Trump 33.2%. Here’s the bettors’ odds including some longshot candidates, among them Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson — and Clinton, of course:          This article has been updated and expanded to include additional recent and relevant information.

The fact that the polls in Florida favor Biden should be one of the biggest warning signs yet for Trump's fledgling campaign. Yes, we still have 100 days to go, and history does suggest that the gap in Florida could close.          Still, Florida is probably the bellwether state that most meets the definition of \"must win\" for Trump if he wants to be elected to a second term, and he is losing there.          Moreover, it's a state that leans a little bit to the right of the nation. The last time the state voted more Democratic than the nation as a whole in a presidential election was 1976. The fact that Trump is down here by an average of 8 points in high quality live interview polls since June 1 suggests he is down significantly nationally.          Biden, on the other hand, has a clear path to 270 electoral votes without Florida. Biden has held 6 to 12 point leads in polls released this week from Michigan and Pennsylvania. This includes 6 point and 12 point advantages in Michigan from CBS News/YouGov and medianame/SSRS polls respectively released on Sunday. High quality polls from June gave Biden an average 10-point lead in Wisconsin . If Biden adds all of those states to his column plus the 232 electoral votes from the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, he gets to 278 electoral votes.          Winning Florida gives Biden a lot of backup options given that it's worth 29 electoral votes. If Biden adds the 29 electoral votes from Florida to the states Clinton took in 2016, he gets 261 electoral votes. Biden would need just 9 electoral votes more to get an electoral college majority. He could add any other state that Trump won in 2016 by 9.0 points or less.          As I noted a few months ago , Florida is geographically and demographically diverse from the Great Lake battleground states. If Biden stumbles in the mostly White Great Lake swing states, he could conceivably hold onto Florida and add on the diverse swing state of Arizona. Biden has consistently been ahead in Arizona, and he was up 4 and 5 points in the latest medianame/SSRS and NBC News/Marist College polls out Sunday.          Additionally, Biden could just win one of those Great Lake battleground states and Florida to get to 270 electoral votes. Biden could, for example, add Michigan (16 electoral votes) to his column, and it would be enough. Biden has held the advantage in every single nonpartisan poll in Michigan since early March          every Perhaps as importantly for Democrats, the polling in Florida has generally been accurate at the end of the campaign. There hasn't been an error like there was in the Great Lakes in 2016. The final Florida polls from medianame have been within 3 points of the outcome in presidential election since 2008. The same holds true for the gubernatorial and Senate elections in 2018          With Biden's polling lead being as wide as it is right now in the Sunshine State, the past accuracy of the final polls suggest he really is ahead right now.          The good news for Trump is that history does indicate how difficult it would be for Biden to win the state by a large margin. The last time a Democrat won the state by more than 6 points was 1948 . No candidate from either party has won the state by more than 6 points since 1992.          Overall the point is that we shouldn't be surprised if the margin in Florida closes down the stretch. That's exactly what happened in the 2018 midterms, when Republican candidates for governor and Senate squeaked out wins by less than a point.          As I've said many times before, Trump likely can't win if he doesn't turn around his low approval ratings on the coronavirus. His approval rating in Florida on the issue is just 42% among registered voters in the latest medianame poll.\n",

The latest Fox News poll, however, showed the two candidates tied at 42% each. * In a clear indication that the Biden campaign is trying to expand its appeal to Bernie Sanders' supporters, the former vice president added progressive ideas to his platform yesterday, announcing proposals to lower the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 60, while also endorsing student-debt forgiveness for many low- and middle-income families. * For his part, Sanders told medianame's Chris Hayes last night that he believes the former vice president recognizes the need to build support among the senator's backers. The Vermonter described Biden's new proposals as steps in the \"right direction.\" * In New Hampshire yesterday, a state judge rejected a Republican-backed law that made it more difficult for students to register to vote, calling the policy \"unconstitutional,\" \"discriminatory\" and \"unreasonable.\" * Speaking of the Granite State, Gov. Chris Sununu (R), traditionally a skeptic of widespread absentee voting, announced yesterday that New Hampshire voters will be able to vote by mail in the general election if the coronavirus is still putting the public at risk in the fall. * Nebraska is moving forward with its plans to hold primary elections on May 12, but Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) yesterday encouraged the state's voters to cast ballots via the mail. * And in Georgia, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported yesterday that about 60,000 voters in the state \"recently received absentee ballot request forms with the wrong return mailing or email address.\" The report added that state election officials said absentee ballot requests \"will be delivered to their correct destinations, even if voters send them to the erroneous pre-printed addresses.\""

       "      <td>It’s an argument that much of the country would seemingly disagree with, given that Trump’s job approval numbers remain low and that he lost the popular vote in 2016. But Sanders was probably expressing a view with which many, if not most, of those watching CBN agreed.          We can say that because Fox News included a question echoing Sanders’s sentiment in its most recent poll. (To be clear, this is not a poll conducted among Fox New viewers but a standard, live-caller political poll.) The pollsters asked Americans whether they believed that God wanted Trump to be president. Most said they didn’t — but a quarter of the country agreed with Sanders.          Unsurprisingly, groups that more strongly support the president were more likely to believe that he has, if not a mandate, then at least the imprimatur of a higher power.          Nearly half of Republicans, 45 percent, believe that God wanted Trump to be president, with another 18 percent indicating that they weren’t sure. More than half of white evangelical Protestants — 55 percent — said that God endorsed Trump. Only 3 in 10 evangelicals said categorically that they didn’t think Trump had God’s explicit support in the election.          There’s been a remarkable surge in the partisan divide among evangelicals over the past decade. In 2009, Pew Research Center found that 63 percent of evangelicals identified as Republican, about 35 percentage points more than the number that identified as Democrat. From 1994 to 2009, the average gap in party identification was about 31 points.          After 2009, that gap widened significantly. Now, 77 percent of evangelicals identify as Republican, a gap of 59 points from those who identify as Democrats.          The Fox poll suggests something else about Trump’s presidency, as noted on Twitter by Bloomberg News’s Steven Dennis: It’s hard to see how Trump could ever lose the support of the quarter of Americans who believe he was chosen by God to serve in his position. Trump’s political base is larger than 25 percent, but that 25 percent — those 45 percent of Republicans — seem unlikely to withdraw their support.          It’s worth highlighting, too, that last part of Sanders’s comments, that Trump “has done a tremendous job in supporting a lot of the things that people of faith really care about.” This is true: Trump has put a pointed focus on issues of importance to the evangelical community, explicitly to cement their political support.</td>\n",

       "      <td>As goes Bernie, so go the Democrats, toward nomination or deadlock</td>\n",
       "      <td>Bernie Sanders is the pivot point in the Democrats’ presidential contest. Midway between the first- and second-tier candidates, which camp he joins will determine if this is a two- or a three-candidate race. Without overstatement: As goes Bernie, so go the Democrats — toward a conventional nomination or a deadlocked convention.          Since the first debate over three months ago, the Democratic field has changed a good deal. Overall it has shrunk, internally it has shifted.          Looking at Real Clear Politics’ average (10/15) of national polling, former Vice President Joe Biden still clings to the top spot, despite dropping from 32 to 29 percent. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has leapfrogged into second place, almost doubling from 13 percent to 23 percent. At about five percent, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris lead the second tier, almost all of whom have fallen.          Between these two groups sits Sen. Sanders. Now in third place, Mr. Sanders has been relatively flat, edging down from 16.9 to 15.6 percent — roughly 10 points from each group.          Should Mr. Sanders fall, Ms. Warren would almost certainly benefit. Thus far, Ms. Warren has grown at the expense of Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders, and the second tier. Since Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are on the left, there is neither reason nor evidence his supporters would not go to Ms. Warren.          This would accelerate the current pro-Warren trend and make the contest a two-person race. Once Ms. Warren (or any candidate), consolidates the left’s support, already comprising well over 60 percent of Democrats, Mr. Biden is quickly overwhelmed.          Should Mr. Sanders rise, the Democratic contest changes completely. Such a scenario is neither impossible nor improbable. Mr. Sanders has a loyal and tested base. He was the left’s first standard bearer and is still their most aggressive champion.          Additionally, a Sanders rise need not come directly at Ms. Warren’s expense. It could come from Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren both gaining support as second-tier Democrats withdraw. Should Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders apportion the “other left candidates” approximately 20 percent support, Mr. Sanders would reach roughly 25 percent support and Ms. Warren, roughly 40 percent; Mr. Biden would remain at less than one-third.          In the case of Mr. Sanders falling, the question becomes one of timing. The more quickly it happens, the greater the likelihood that Ms. Warren has time to accumulate the delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot. The longer the duration, the more difficult it becomes as Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden, and potentially others, continue to win delegates, thereby withholding them from Ms. Warren.          In the case of Mr. Sanders rising, there is no mystery. The result would be a chaotic three-way race in which no one reaches the number of delegates needed to win a first ballot nomination.          Already further left than any major party in U.S. presidential election history, a three-way race with Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders splitting the Democratic Party’s left majority would lead it further still, as the two competed for the left’s support. The end-result of a brokered convention would only heighten the chaos, leaving no segment of the Democratic Party pleased, and potentially some unmotivated for November.          The one assurance out of these scenarios is that Mr. Sanders will not quit. He would not in 2016 when he opposed Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party’s consensus choice, from start to finish; he certainly will not for Ms. Warren now.          Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are truly different, representing the old and the new left. Mr. Sanders can argue that he will hold Ms. Warren accountable. That is partly true. Ms. Warren would have every incentive to pivot as early as practicable toward the middle to prepare for the general election, but she will be unable to, so long as Mr. Sanders stays in the race.          In sum, Ms. Warren must beat Mr. Sanders to win. For Democrats it’s a race among the left: Once they coalesce around one candidate, the race will be over — regardless of what Mr. Biden does. The left will therefore decide who wins the nomination, but first they must decide whether Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren wins the left.     • J.T.

       "      <td>Opinion | The unpopular Trump is shrinking the GOP</td>\n",
       "      <td>President Trump has two problems. First, public disapproval of the president and a lack of confidence in him are skyrocketing. Second, Republicans’ solace that “at least the GOP is with him” may be misguided.          As for the overall numbers, his disapproval rating hit a new high of 60 percent in the Gallup poll. In the latest Politico-Morning Consult poll, 53 percent of voters think former FBI director James B. Comey is very or somewhat honest. By a margin of 45 percent to 32 percent, voters pick Comey over Trump when it comes to honesty. A strong plurality of voters think Trump fired Comey over the Russia investigation, not due to concerns about his performance (47 percent to 36 percent).          By a large majority, voters disfavor his signature bill, the American Health Care Act (which now he concedes is “mean”!). Big tax cuts for the rich, the heart of his tax plan, are unpopular as well. In short, even if Trump could get back to his agenda, it is not going to find favor with the voters.          As for GOP support, let’s keep in mind a few things. First, he’s a minority president who got only 46.1 percent of the vote. He cannot afford to lose voters; he needs to gain support from independents and even Democrats. Second, the Virginia gubernatorial primary results and generic congressional polling show that Democrats have a decisive advantage when it comes to enthusiasm and engagement. Third, we have the Virginia gubernatorial primary results and in a week we will have the results of Georgia’s 6th Congressional District special election to test the proposition that as the GOP becomes the Party of Trump, it becomes less attractive to a mass of voters who have traditionally considered themselves to be Republicans. A shrunken GOP means losses in 2018, the potential for the House to flip to Democratic control and proceed to impeachment, and the emergence of either a primary challenger to Trump, a third-party movement or an enlarged Democratic Party with GOP defectors.          It is not illogical to conclude that Trump is losing the curious or skeptical voters who were willing to give him the chance given his Democratic opponent in 2016, the perception that he was a successful manager and his image as a less ideologically dogmatic kind of Republican.          Republicans would dearly love to keep running against Hillary Clinton, but she won’t be on the ballot in 2018 or 2020. Trump has proved himself thoroughly incapable of managing the executive branch, so much so that Republicans now try to defend his misconduct by saying he’s new to all this.          The lack of progress on major issues cements the argument that he is less capable than the “stupid” politicians he decried in the campaign. His stumbles on the world stage — getting into spats with allies, pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, inviting trade wars with key partners — reinforce the image of a blunderbuss who is making the United States less respected.          Finally, Trump has jettisoned his populist rhetoric and positions (promise of no tax cuts for the rich and no cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) for a Scrooge-like agenda that would roll back Medicaid, make health insurance more expensive for many who voted for him, and deliver big tax cuts for the rich that would require big cuts in popular programs and would unleash a torrent of red ink.          Ironically, Trump offered the GOP the hope for an expanded GOP, one big enough to reach white, working-class voters. The GOP he now presides over is not only politically dysfunctional and unpopular, but also arguably smaller than the one he took over in 2016. Democrats have a tremendous opportunity if they keep their heads about them, make the case against not just Trump personally but also his Trumpian agenda, and offer their own agenda that is both positive and non-radical.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Rasmussen Poll Shows 2:1 Support for Hire American over Business First</td>\n",
       "      <td>The swing voters who will decide the 2020 election oppose by 2:1 the inflow and hiring of more foreign workers amid the coronavirus crash, according to a May 20-21 poll of 1,250 likely voters by Rasmussen Reports.          Fifty-nine percent of swing voting “moderate” voters and 56 percent of non-GOP, non-Democrat “other” voters agree that it would be “Better for businesses to raise the pay and try harder to recruit non-working Americans even if it causes prices to rise,” the poll says.          In contrast, just 27 percent of moderates and 20 percent of “others” told Rasmussen that it would be “Better for the government to bring in new foreign workers to help keep business costs and prices down.”          The poll arrives as President Donald Trump huddles with his advisers to draft curbs on a variety of visa programs. Trump’s curbs might free up many jobs for the many American graduates who face unemployment and poverty because of the Chinese coronavirus. However, many of Trump’s deputies put business priorities first and so favor the inflow of cheap labor for companies and investors.          Rasmussen also showed that Trump’s rhetoric of “Hire American First” policy is also supported by 73 percent of Republicans and conservatives. Just 16 percent of Republican and conservative voters agree with the business pro-migration strategy.          The “Hire American First” results were slightly muffled when Rasmussen asked about “higher-skill” jobs.          Lobbyists for many business groups insist they need more high skilled immigrants, even though many millions of skilled Americans have been pushed aside by outsourcing. This “high skill” pitch has been effective with legislators, congressional staffers, and journalists — even though many U.S. college graduates are more skilled than the “high skill” migrants demanded by business groups, say Indian migrants and U.S. managers.          Rasmussen asked, “Should Congress increase the number of foreign workers taking higher-skill U.S. jobs or does the country already have enough talented people to train and recruit for most of those jobs?”          Sixty percent of swing-voting “other” and 58 percent of “moderate” likely voters sided with the “Hire American First” pitch by saying, “The country already has enough talented people to train and recruit for most of those jobs.”          Just 23 percent of “other” and 28 percent of “moderates” called for the government to “Increase the number of foreign workers taking higher-skill U.S. jobs.”          But more respondents gave “not sure” answers to the “High Skill” question, suggesting a hidden reserve of “Hire American” voters.          The poll showed that 72 percent of Republicans and 69 percent of conservatives said the country “has enough talented people.” Just 19 percent of Republicans and 23 percent of conservatives urged the government to “increase the number of foreign workers.”          The “Hire American First” option is also strongly supported by two demographics where Trump needs more voters — graduates and suburbanites.          Notably, the poll shows that college graduates want to put American workers first. They responded 56 percent to 31 percent against importing more skilled workers. Suburbanites responded similarly, 59 percent against more skilled workers, and 25 percent in favor of more foreign workers.           The same “Hire American First” skew was also seen in the “raise the pay” question, where graduates split 63 percent to 23 percent, and suburbanites split 64 percent to 2o percent.          The loudest voices in favor of more migration were Democrats and people who earn more than $100,000 per year. For example, 33 percent of Democrats said it is “better for the government to bring in new foreign workers to help keep business costs and prices down.” (54 percent opposed)          Thirty-nine percent of Democrats said they would “increase the number of foreign workers taking higher-skill U.S. jobs.” (46 percent opposed)          Rasmussen polls match other surveys that show that Americans generously want to welcome migrants — but rationally want companies to hire Americans before importing foreign workers, especially in an economic crisis.          These polls show that the public strongly objects to companies hiring foreign workers before American employees. For example, an August 2017 poll reported that 68 percent of Americans oppose companies’ use of H-1B visa workers to outsource U.S.-based jobs that could be held by Americans.          In response, pro-migration business-first groups try to divert public attention away from migration, jobs, and wages.          For example, pro-migration groups commission and publicize skewed polls which prod Americans to voice support for attractive young migrants — such as ‘dreamers’ — or for foreign doctors, and to publicly endorse the 1960s myth that the United States is a nation of immigrants, not a nation of and for Americans.

       "      <td>medianame News Exit Poll: Young and liberal, LGBTs are 10 percent of today’s electorate One out of every 10 people voting in today’s presidential primaries identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, according to the medianame News Exit Poll conducted in 12 of the 14 Super Tuesday states across the country. Reflecting changing generational attitudes about sexuality and gender identity, LGBT Democratic voters are substantially younger than today’s electorate as a whole. A third of LGBT people voting on Super Tuesday are younger than 30 years old, while 65 percent of the LGBT voters today are under 45. LGBT Super Tuesday voters are a strikingly liberal group: Exactly half of LGBT voters today call themselves \"very liberal\" and another 30 percent say they are “somewhat liberal.” Just 4 percent of LGBT Democratic voters say they are conservative.          medianame News Exit Poll: Liberals account for more than 6 in 10 Super Tuesday voters Liberal voters are dominating the electorate in Tuesday’s Democratic presidential primaries across the country, according to the medianame News Exit Poll conducted in 12 of the 14 Super Tuesday states. Sixty-two percent of voters in Tuesday's primaries consider themselves liberal. This includes a quarter of voters who describe themselves as “very liberal.” That puts the Super Tuesday electorate ideologically on par with voters in three of the four Democratic presidential contests held thus far: Liberals accounted for more than 60 percent of voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. Last Saturday’s primary in South Carolina featured a more moderate electorate: Liberals accounted for just half of those voters.          Joe Gallagher voted on Super Tuesday for former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary contest, but he's not thrilled about it. \"It's too bad because Bernie is the best candidate probably in 30 years,\" Gallagher, 65, told medianame News after he left a polling center in West Hollywood. \"I really am embarrassed not to vote for him, but I felt like I had no choice.\" Gallagher said he did a lot of research into polling and decided about two months ago that Biden was the most electable Democrat running. His sentiment was shared by other voters around Los Angeles. \"My objective and goal is to get Trump out of office,\" said Tara, 26, who strongly supports Elizabeth Warren. But on Tuesday morning, she too decided to vote for Biden. Tara concluded after talking to friends that the race was quickly becoming one between Biden and Bernie Sanders, and she didn't want to get behind Sanders. \"It took much deliberation, and I'm not so happy,\" Tara said, \"but I think, unfortunately, voting for Warren may be a wasted vote that I don't want to do, even though I love Warren.\" Still, voters like Naz, 41, are sticking with Sanders, a candidate he sees as an antidote to President Donald Trump's policies. \"It's nice to see someone try to take this country to the very far left, since Trump has taken it to the far right, because I think America is too far in the middle,\" Naz explained. \"I think Bernie will take it far left, which will balance out this country a bit.\"          medianame News Exit Poll: In three states, half of Democratic voters say self-funded campaigns are unfair Large shares of Democratic primary voters generally take a negative view of self-funded campaigns by billionaires like Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, according to early results from the medianame News Exit Poll. In the three states where Super Tuesday voters were asked about the issue, about half said it is unfair that candidates can spend unlimited amounts of their own money on their campaigns. This sentiment ranged from 49 percent of Democratic primary voters in Texas and Tennessee to 53 percent in North Carolina. Among the remaining candidates, this issue is front and center for Bloomberg, who has invested $500 million of his own money into his campaign. About three in 10 voters who supported Bloomberg in these states said that candidates spending unlimited amounts of their own money on their campaigns is unfair.          Los Angeles voters see long lines at some polling centers LOS ANGELES — Voters lined up around the block at several locations around the Beverly Grove and West Hollywood neighborhoods in Los Angeles. The city has nearly 1,000 voting centers open around the county, and around a quarter of them were open for early voting in the days leading up to Super Tuesday. But for voters who showed up on primary day, many found lines longer than usual. At one polling center on West Knoll Drive, where about 100 people waited in a line stretching down the block, voters told medianame News that they had waited for nearly 75 minutes to vote. Those casting ballots nearby at Rosewood Avenue Elementary School and Laurel Span School said they had waited 25 to 30 minutes, but several said there usually isn't any wait. Polling workers walked around outside of one location at a recreation center on North Vista Avenue in West Hollywood instructing people waiting in line that they could start filling out their election choices on LAvote.net, then use a QR code once they're inside to print a ballot with their picks already selected. That process is part of a new voting machine setup in Los Angeles County.          medianame News Exit Poll: 1 in 7 Super Tuesday voters won’t pledge to support the Democratic nominee Fourteen percent of those voting in Democratic primaries across the country Tuesday aren’t committing to voting for the party’s nominee in November, according to the medianame News Exit Poll conducted in 12 of the 14 Super Tuesday states. That’s about 1 in 7 voters. As they left the polls, voters were asked if they planned to vote for the Democratic nominee this fall “regardless of who it is.” Supporters of Mike Bloomberg were least likely to pledge to vote Democratic in November: 18 percent of his voters wouldn't commit to the party’s ticket. The most loyal Democratic voters? Supporters of Elizabeth Warren. Ninety-one percent of her voters said they’d support the party’s nominee regardless of who it is.</td>\n",

But Sanders was probably expressing a view with which many, if not most, of those watching CBN agreed.          We can say that because Fox News included a question echoing Sanders’s sentiment in its most recent poll. (To be clear, this is not a poll conducted among Fox New viewers but a standard, live-caller political poll.) The pollsters asked Americans whether they believed that God wanted Trump to be president. Most said they didn’t — but a quarter of the country agreed with Sanders.          Unsurprisingly, groups that more strongly support the president were more likely to believe that he has, if not a mandate, then at least the imprimatur of a higher power.          Nearly half of Republicans, 45 percent, believe that God wanted Trump to be president, with another 18 percent indicating that they weren’t sure. More than half of white evangelical Protestants — 55 percent — said that God endorsed Trump. Only 3 in 10 evangelicals said categorically that they didn’t think Trump had God’s explicit support in the election.          There’s been a remarkable surge in the partisan divide among evangelicals over the past decade. In 2009, Pew Research Center found that 63 percent of evangelicals identified as Republican, about 35 percentage points more than the number that identified as Democrat. From 1994 to 2009, the average gap in party identification was about 31 points.          After 2009, that gap widened significantly. Now, 77 percent of evangelicals identify as Republican, a gap of 59 points from those who identify as Democrats.          The Fox poll suggests something else about Trump’s presidency, as noted on Twitter by Bloomberg News’s Steven Dennis: It’s hard to see how Trump could ever lose the support of the quarter of Americans who believe he was chosen by God to serve in his position. Trump’s political base is larger than 25 percent, but that 25 percent — those 45 percent of Republicans — seem unlikely to withdraw their support.          It’s worth highlighting, too, that last part of Sanders’s comments, that Trump “has done a tremendous job in supporting a lot of the things that people of faith really care about.” This is true: Trump has put a pointed focus on issues of importance to the evangelical community, explicitly to cement their political support.\n",

Midway between the first- and second-tier candidates, which camp he joins will determine if this is a two- or a three-candidate race. Without overstatement: As goes Bernie, so go the Democrats — toward a conventional nomination or a deadlocked convention.          Since the first debate over three months ago, the Democratic field has changed a good deal. Overall it has shrunk, internally it has shifted.          Looking at Real Clear Politics’ average (10/15) of national polling, former Vice President Joe Biden still clings to the top spot, despite dropping from 32 to 29 percent. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has leapfrogged into second place, almost doubling from 13 percent to 23 percent. At about five percent, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris lead the second tier, almost all of whom have fallen.          Between these two groups sits Sen. Sanders. Now in third place, Mr. Sanders has been relatively flat, edging down from 16.9 to 15.6 percent — roughly 10 points from each group.          Should Mr. Sanders fall, Ms. Warren would almost certainly benefit. Thus far, Ms. Warren has grown at the expense of Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders, and the second tier. Since Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are on the left, there is neither reason nor evidence his supporters would not go to Ms. Warren.          This would accelerate the current pro-Warren trend and make the contest a two-person race. Once Ms. Warren (or any candidate), consolidates the left’s support, already comprising well over 60 percent of Democrats, Mr. Biden is quickly overwhelmed.          Should Mr. Sanders rise, the Democratic contest changes completely. Such a scenario is neither impossible nor improbable. Mr. Sanders has a loyal and tested base. He was the left’s first standard bearer and is still their most aggressive champion.          Additionally, a Sanders rise need not come directly at Ms. Warren’s expense. It could come from Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren both gaining support as second-tier Democrats withdraw. Should Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders apportion the “other left candidates” approximately 20 percent support, Mr. Sanders would reach roughly 25 percent support and Ms. Warren, roughly 40 percent; Mr. Biden would remain at less than one-third.          In the case of Mr. Sanders falling, the question becomes one of timing. The more quickly it happens, the greater the likelihood that Ms. Warren has time to accumulate the delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot. The longer the duration, the more difficult it becomes as Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden, and potentially others, continue to win delegates, thereby withholding them from Ms. Warren.          In the case of Mr. Sanders rising, there is no mystery. The result would be a chaotic three-way race in which no one reaches the number of delegates needed to win a first ballot nomination.          Already further left than any major party in U.S. presidential election history, a three-way race with Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders splitting the Democratic Party’s left majority would lead it further still, as the two competed for the left’s support. The end-result of a brokered convention would only heighten the chaos, leaving no segment of the Democratic Party pleased, and potentially some unmotivated for November.          The one assurance out of these scenarios is that Mr. Sanders will not quit. He would not in 2016 when he opposed Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party’s consensus choice, from start to finish; he certainly will not for Ms. Warren now.          Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are truly different, representing the old and the new left. Mr. Sanders can argue that he will hold Ms. Warren accountable. That is partly true. Ms. Warren would have every incentive to pivot as early as practicable toward the middle to prepare for the general election, but she will be unable to, so long as Mr. Sanders stays in the race.          In sum, Ms. Warren must beat Mr. Sanders to win. For Democrats it’s a race among the left: Once they coalesce around one candidate, the race will be over — regardless of what Mr. Biden does. The left will therefore decide who wins the nomination, but first they must decide whether Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren wins the left.     • J.T.

First, public disapproval of the president and a lack of confidence in him are skyrocketing. Second, Republicans’ solace that “at least the GOP is with him” may be misguided.          As for the overall numbers, his disapproval rating hit a new high of 60 percent in the Gallup poll. In the latest Politico-Morning Consult poll, 53 percent of voters think former FBI director James B. Comey is very or somewhat honest. By a margin of 45 percent to 32 percent, voters pick Comey over Trump when it comes to honesty. A strong plurality of voters think Trump fired Comey over the Russia investigation, not due to concerns about his performance (47 percent to 36 percent).          By a large majority, voters disfavor his signature bill, the American Health Care Act (which now he concedes is “mean”!). Big tax cuts for the rich, the heart of his tax plan, are unpopular as well. In short, even if Trump could get back to his agenda, it is not going to find favor with the voters.          As for GOP support, let’s keep in mind a few things. First, he’s a minority president who got only 46.1 percent of the vote. He cannot afford to lose voters; he needs to gain support from independents and even Democrats. Second, the Virginia gubernatorial primary results and generic congressional polling show that Democrats have a decisive advantage when it comes to enthusiasm and engagement. Third, we have the Virginia gubernatorial primary results and in a week we will have the results of Georgia’s 6th Congressional District special election to test the proposition that as the GOP becomes the Party of Trump, it becomes less attractive to a mass of voters who have traditionally considered themselves to be Republicans. A shrunken GOP means losses in 2018, the potential for the House to flip to Democratic control and proceed to impeachment, and the emergence of either a primary challenger to Trump, a third-party movement or an enlarged Democratic Party with GOP defectors.          It is not illogical to conclude that Trump is losing the curious or skeptical voters who were willing to give him the chance given his Democratic opponent in 2016, the perception that he was a successful manager and his image as a less ideologically dogmatic kind of Republican.          Republicans would dearly love to keep running against Hillary Clinton, but she won’t be on the ballot in 2018 or 2020. Trump has proved himself thoroughly incapable of managing the executive branch, so much so that Republicans now try to defend his misconduct by saying he’s new to all this.          The lack of progress on major issues cements the argument that he is less capable than the “stupid” politicians he decried in the campaign. His stumbles on the world stage — getting into spats with allies, pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, inviting trade wars with key partners — reinforce the image of a blunderbuss who is making the United States less respected.          Finally, Trump has jettisoned his populist rhetoric and positions (promise of no tax cuts for the rich and no cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) for a Scrooge-like agenda that would roll back Medicaid, make health insurance more expensive for many who voted for him, and deliver big tax cuts for the rich that would require big cuts in popular programs and would unleash a torrent of red ink.          Ironically, Trump offered the GOP the hope for an expanded GOP, one big enough to reach white, working-class voters. The GOP he now presides over is not only politically dysfunctional and unpopular, but also arguably smaller than the one he took over in 2016. Democrats have a tremendous opportunity if they keep their heads about them, make the case against not just Trump personally but also his Trumpian agenda, and offer their own agenda that is both positive and non-radical.\n",
       "694         Rasmussen Poll Shows 2:1 Support for Hire American over Business First                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The swing voters who will decide the 2020 election oppose by 2:1 the inflow and hiring of more foreign workers amid the coronavirus crash, according to a May 20-21 poll of 1,250 likely voters by Rasmussen Reports.          Fifty-nine percent of swing voting “moderate” voters and 56 percent of non-GOP, non-Democrat “other” voters agree that it would be “Better for businesses to raise the pay and try harder to recruit non-working Americans even if it causes prices to rise,” the poll says.          In contrast, just 27 percent of moderates and 20 percent of “others” told Rasmussen that it would be “Better for the government to bring in new foreign workers to help keep business costs and prices down.”          The poll arrives as President Donald Trump huddles with his advisers to draft curbs on a variety of visa programs. Trump’s curbs might free up many jobs for the many American graduates who face unemployment and poverty because of the Chinese coronavirus. However, many of Trump’s deputies put business priorities first and so favor the inflow of cheap labor for companies and investors.          Rasmussen also showed that Trump’s rhetoric of “Hire American First” policy is also supported by 73 percent of Republicans and conservatives. Just 16 percent of Republican and conservative voters agree with the business pro-migration strategy.          The “Hire American First” results were slightly muffled when Rasmussen asked about “higher-skill” jobs.          Lobbyists for many business groups insist they need more high skilled immigrants, even though many millions of skilled Americans have been pushed aside by outsourcing. This “high skill” pitch has been effective with legislators, congressional staffers, and journalists — even though many U.S. college graduates are more skilled than the “high skill” migrants demanded by business groups, say Indian migrants and U.S. managers.          Rasmussen asked, “Should Congress increase the number of foreign workers taking higher-skill U.S. jobs or does the country already have enough talented people to train and recruit for most of those jobs?”          Sixty percent of swing-voting “other” and 58 percent of “moderate” likely voters sided with the “Hire American First” pitch by saying, “The country already has enough talented people to train and recruit for most of those jobs.”          Just 23 percent of “other” and 28 percent of “moderates” called for the government to “Increase the number of foreign workers taking higher-skill U.S. jobs.”          But more respondents gave “not sure” answers to the “High Skill” question, suggesting a hidden reserve of “Hire American” voters.          The poll showed that 72 percent of Republicans and 69 percent of conservatives said the country “has enough talented people.” Just 19 percent of Republicans and 23 percent of conservatives urged the government to “increase the number of foreign workers.”          The “Hire American First” option is also strongly supported by two demographics where Trump needs more voters — graduates and suburbanites.          Notably, the poll shows that college graduates want to put American workers first. They responded 56 percent to 31 percent against importing more skilled workers. Suburbanites responded similarly, 59 percent against more skilled workers, and 25 percent in favor of more foreign workers.           The same “Hire American First” skew was also seen in the “raise the pay” question, where graduates split 63 percent to 23 percent, and suburbanites split 64 percent to 2o percent.          The loudest voices in favor of more migration were Democrats and people who earn more than $100,000 per year. For example, 33 percent of Democrats said it is “better for the government to bring in new foreign workers to help keep business costs and prices down.” (54 percent opposed)          Thirty-nine percent of Democrats said they would “increase the number of foreign workers taking higher-skill U.S. jobs.” (46 percent opposed)          Rasmussen polls match other surveys that show that Americans generously want to welcome migrants — but rationally want companies to hire Americans before importing foreign workers, especially in an economic crisis.          These polls show that the public strongly objects to companies hiring foreign workers before American employees. For example, an August 2017 poll reported that 68 percent of Americans oppose companies’ use of H-1B visa workers to outsource U.S.-based jobs that could be held by Americans.          In response, pro-migration business-first groups try to divert public attention away from migration, jobs, and wages.          For example, pro-migration groups commission and publicize skewed polls which prod Americans to voice support for attractive young migrants — such as ‘dreamers’ — or for foreign doctors, and to publicly endorse the 1960s myth that the United States is a nation of immigrants, not a nation of and for Americans.

       "1291      Exit Poll: Young and liberal, LGBTs are 10 percent of today’s electorate  medianame News Exit Poll: Young and liberal, LGBTs are 10 percent of today’s electorate One out of every 10 people voting in today’s presidential primaries identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, according to the medianame News Exit Poll conducted in 12 of the 14 Super Tuesday states across the country. Reflecting changing generational attitudes about sexuality and gender identity, LGBT Democratic voters are substantially younger than today’s electorate as a whole. A third of LGBT people voting on Super Tuesday are younger than 30 years old, while 65 percent of the LGBT voters today are under 45. LGBT Super Tuesday voters are a strikingly liberal group: Exactly half of LGBT voters today call themselves \"very liberal\" and another 30 percent say they are “somewhat liberal.” Just 4 percent of LGBT Democratic voters say they are conservative.          medianame News Exit Poll: Liberals account for more than 6 in 10 Super Tuesday voters Liberal voters are dominating the electorate in Tuesday’s Democratic presidential primaries across the country, according to the medianame News Exit Poll conducted in 12 of the 14 Super Tuesday states. Sixty-two percent of voters in Tuesday's primaries consider themselves liberal. This includes a quarter of voters who describe themselves as “very liberal.” That puts the Super Tuesday electorate ideologically on par with voters in three of the four Democratic presidential contests held thus far: Liberals accounted for more than 60 percent of voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. Last Saturday’s primary in South Carolina featured a more moderate electorate: Liberals accounted for just half of those voters.          Joe Gallagher voted on Super Tuesday for former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary contest, but he's not thrilled about it. \"It's too bad because Bernie is the best candidate probably in 30 years,\" Gallagher, 65, told medianame News after he left a polling center in West Hollywood. \"I really am embarrassed not to vote for him, but I felt like I had no choice.\" Gallagher said he did a lot of research into polling and decided about two months ago that Biden was the most electable Democrat running. His sentiment was shared by other voters around Los Angeles. \"My objective and goal is to get Trump out of office,\" said Tara, 26, who strongly supports Elizabeth Warren. But on Tuesday morning, she too decided to vote for Biden. Tara concluded after talking to friends that the race was quickly becoming one between Biden and Bernie Sanders, and she didn't want to get behind Sanders. \"It took much deliberation, and I'm not so happy,\" Tara said, \"but I think, unfortunately, voting for Warren may be a wasted vote that I don't want to do, even though I love Warren.\" Still, voters like Naz, 41, are sticking with Sanders, a candidate he sees as an antidote to President Donald Trump's policies. \"It's nice to see someone try to take this country to the very far left, since Trump has taken it to the far right, because I think America is too far in the middle,\" Naz explained. \"I think Bernie will take it far left, which will balance out this country a bit.\"          medianame News Exit Poll: In three states, half of Democratic voters say self-funded campaigns are unfair Large shares of Democratic primary voters generally take a negative view of self-funded campaigns by billionaires like Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, according to early results from the medianame News Exit Poll. In the three states where Super Tuesday voters were asked about the issue, about half said it is unfair that candidates can spend unlimited amounts of their own money on their campaigns. This sentiment ranged from 49 percent of Democratic primary voters in Texas and Tennessee to 53 percent in North Carolina. Among the remaining candidates, this issue is front and center for Bloomberg, who has invested $500 million of his own money into his campaign. About three in 10 voters who supported Bloomberg in these states said that candidates spending unlimited amounts of their own money on their campaigns is unfair.          Los Angeles voters see long lines at some polling centers LOS ANGELES — Voters lined up around the block at several locations around the Beverly Grove and West Hollywood neighborhoods in Los Angeles. The city has nearly 1,000 voting centers open around the county, and around a quarter of them were open for early voting in the days leading up to Super Tuesday. But for voters who showed up on primary day, many found lines longer than usual. At one polling center on West Knoll Drive, where about 100 people waited in a line stretching down the block, voters told medianame News that they had waited for nearly 75 minutes to vote. Those casting ballots nearby at Rosewood Avenue Elementary School and Laurel Span School said they had waited 25 to 30 minutes, but several said there usually isn't any wait. Polling workers walked around outside of one location at a recreation center on North Vista Avenue in West Hollywood instructing people waiting in line that they could start filling out their election choices on LAvote.net, then use a QR code once they're inside to print a ballot with their picks already selected. That process is part of a new voting machine setup in Los Angeles County.          medianame News Exit Poll: 1 in 7 Super Tuesday voters won’t pledge to support the Democratic nominee Fourteen percent of those voting in Democratic primaries across the country Tuesday aren’t committing to voting for the party’s nominee in November, according to the medianame News Exit Poll conducted in 12 of the 14 Super Tuesday states. That’s about 1 in 7 voters. As they left the polls, voters were asked if they planned to vote for the Democratic nominee this fall “regardless of who it is.” Supporters of Mike Bloomberg were least likely to pledge to vote Democratic in November: 18 percent of his voters wouldn't commit to the party’s ticket. The most loyal Democratic voters? Supporters of Elizabeth Warren. Ninety-one percent of her voters said they’d support the party’s nominee regardless of who it is."

       "      <td>Republicans are debating including in the Senate resolution, which would govern the rules of the trial, a provision to dismiss the charges, something that would require 51 votes and would stop the trial in its tracks.          But moving ahead with a dismissal vote could put Republicans up for reelection in a tough spot if they are seen as moving too quickly to dismiss the case. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could not afford to lose more than two votes -- and GOP sources say the Kentucky Republican currently does not have enough votes to simply dismiss the case.          McConnell has made clear to his colleagues that he wants Trump to emerge victorious in the trial and is not willing to hold a vote that could fail, sources said. He's also keenly aware of what a vote to dismiss would look like politically, according to Republican senators, and has shepherded his conference away from the idea for several weeks.          Once the trial has begun, the Senate can vote on the merits of the articles of impeachment and choose to acquit Trump, something that can be done with only 34 votes because the Constitution requires 67 votes to convict the President and remove him from office. GOP proponents of this move argue Trump would have a stronger argument to say he was exonerated on the merits of the case, rather than simply relying on a procedural vote to dismiss the charges. Trump, though, might have to wait longer for a vote on acquittal to occur.          Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of McConnell's leadership team, said Monday he would prefer a vote to acquit the President on the merits, rather than seek a quick vote to dismiss the charges. \"That would be my advice. Let both sides have their say and have their vote.\" And Cornyn downplayed a weekend tweet from Trump calling for an \"outright dismissal.\" \"At different times, the President has expressed different views,\" Cornyn said. \"I wouldn't get too distracted by an intervening tweet.\" While Republicans are short of the votes to dismiss the charges, the issue remains a point of discussion due to McConnell's insistence that the initial rules of the trial hew closely to those used in President Bill Clinton's trial in 1999 . That resolution included a motion to dismiss, which failed. Republican senators this time around have been debating whether to remove it entirely, or push it further back in the proceedings than where it was structured then, senators familiar with the discussions said. The White House wants to keep the motion to dismiss in play because \"there's no reason to take options off the table at the beginning of the whole process,\" said one source familiar with the discussions. McConnell has counseled Republicans privately that they can decide how to proceed after both the House Democratic impeachment managers and President's defense team make their cases, followed by questions from senators. At that point, GOP senators must decide whether to allow witnesses, seek to acquit the President or move to dismiss the case. \"Yes, I am,\" Sen. Lamar Alexander, a retiring Tennessee Republican and McConnell confidante, said Monday when asked if he's open to witnesses. \"What I think is important is we have a vote on whether we need additional documents and witnesses. And that would only be appropriate after we've heard the case and asked our questions.\" That tracks directly with the model McConnell has touted now for weeks: a Senate resolution governing the trial that follow the procedures of Clinton's trial. In that Clinton resolution, the Senate included a motion to dismiss the charges after opening arguments were delivered and after senators asked their questions. About two weeks into the Clinton trial, Democrats forced a vote to dismiss the charges. But that dismissal measure failed, 44-56, and the trial continued for another two-and-half weeks. McConnell hinted last week that the Senate resolution would include a provision allowing the charges to be dismissed, but senators said the talks about how to handle the motion to dismiss still hadn't been finalized. \"We're going to have a similar resolution,\" McConnell told reporters. \"It may not be word for word, exactly the same, but a similar resolution. And we'll be glad to show it to you when -- when we unveil it.\" McConnell fueled Democratic concerns about dismissing the charges outright when he signed onto a resolution sponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, that would allow a senator to offer a motion to dismiss if the House did not transmit the articles of impeachment within 25 days. The viability of Hawley's resolution was viewed as limited to impossible -- it would require a Senate rule change, which would take 67 votes to occur. Republicans only control 53 seats in the chamber. McConnell could move to drop the vote threshold to 51, but it would require him to \"go nuclear,\" or move to eliminate the legislative filibuster, something he has long opposed. A source familiar with McConnell's decision to support the resolution said he backed \"the spirit\" of Hawley's idea given the frustration over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to hold onto the articles for more than three weeks, but wasn't planning to push forward on it given its prospects. Pelosi's about to hit send on the impeachment articles But McConnell's decision to sign onto the idea drew sharp criticism from Pelosi, who demanded to see the Senate resolution and understand how the dismissal provision would be structured before sending over the articles of impeachment that would initiate the trial. She ultimately relented and indicated that the articles would be sent over this week. ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Dismissing is a coverup ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Over the weekend, Trump argued that having a trial would add credibility to the Democrats' case, calling for a dismissal of the charges. \"Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, 'no pressure' Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have,\" Trump tweeted. \"I agree!\" This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The letter — addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) — said Capitol security officials are considering measures that are all but certain to make it harder for journalists to report on the trial and question senators about their actions.          A magnetometer in the Senate press gallery will require reporters to trickle into the chamber one at a time. Electronic devices will be banned, leaving reporters to scuttle in and out of the room to send tweets and emails. Reporters will be placed in pens, roping them off and restricting their ability to speak freely with senators as they enter and exit.          “Currently,” Wire tweeted, “we can walk with Senators as they enter the chamber, wait for them outside of meetings or lunches. It leads to a diversity of voices. Penning us means people across the country might not hear from their senator.”          Officials have also proposed limiting video coverage of the arrival of the articles of impeachment to a single pool camera with no audio, she said.          “These potential restrictions fail to acknowledge what currently works on Capitol Hill, or the way the American public expects to be able to follow a vital news event about their government in the digital age,” the committee’s letter read.          Details about the nature and scope of the restrictions under consideration remained unclear, as neither the Senate sergeant at arms nor the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, which are responsible for them, has issued a formal document.          “You’ll have to decide where’s the best place to watch; it’s like watching a football game,” Blunt said. “Where’s the best place to watch it?”          Blunt told the Star that while most of the trial will be broadcast, other segments will be closed, in line with procedures during the trial of President Bill Clinton in early 1999. “I mean closed session,” he said. “I mean there will be nobody there but senators and essential staff. No cameras, no C-SPAN, no coverage.”          He said that “part of the decision about access” for reporters to senators “will be driven by how quickly you can clear the room” for the closed sessions, “so you can have that debate and get people back into the room so you can move forward.”          Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, called the restrictions “a big mistake” in comments to reporters after Tuesday night’s Democratic candidate debate in Des Moines, where she is campaigning for the party’s presidential nomination.          The correspondents’ committee said members raised concerns with the sergeant at arms and the Rules Committee. “But decisions are being made quickly as plans for the trial are completed,” the letter read, “and we are hearing that nearly every suggestion has been rejected without an explanation of how the restrictions contribute to safety rather than simply limit coverage of the trial.”          News of the restrictions prompted alarm online from reporters, with some protesting the move as one that will effectively shield senators from scrutiny during the trial.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Some House Democrats push Pelosi to withhold impeachment articles, delay Senate trial</td>\n",
       "      <td>The gambit has gained some traction inside the left wing of the House Democratic Caucus this week. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said Wednesday, as his colleagues debated the impeachment articles on the House floor, that he has spoken to three dozen Democratic lawmakers who had expressed some level of enthusiasm for the idea of “rounding out the record and spending the time to do this right.”          Another Democrat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said there is “serious concern about whether there will be a fair trial on the Senate side” and acknowledged active talks about withholding the articles.          The notion has been most prominently advocated by Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor who has advised the House Judiciary Committee on the impeachment process. In a recent medianame op-ed, he wrote that “the public has a right to observe a meaningful trial rather than simply learn that the result is a verdict of not guilty.”          Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has asked McConnell to call several Trump administration witnesses, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. McConnell has dismissed those requests and signaled that he expects to hold a relatively short trial that will end with a summary dismissal of the impeachment charges.          Republicans have scoffed at the notion of the House withholding the articles, noting it hardly counts as leverage to deny the GOP the ability to remove a president that the party wants to keep in place. Some aides further argued that withholding the articles would only fuel Republican arguments that Democrats are engaged in a partisan abuse of the Constitution.          But Democratic leaders may be forced to deal with the issue in the coming days. Blumenauer said he had already raised it with Pelosi (Calif.), House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (Md.) and other top party leaders.          Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Hoyer did not rule out the idea: “It’s an interesting proposal. I don’t think that that’s the path we will follow, but that does not mean we will immediately deliver it. There are considerations related to other legislation.”          A senior Democratic aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations said the impeachment articles will not be immediately transmitted to the Senate on Wednesday. Rather, they will be held until Pelosi names impeachment managers, the House members who will present the case for Trump’s removal in the Senate.          “There will be a debate and vote on that resolution” naming the managers, the aide said. If a significant number of Democrats refuse to vote for that resolution, they could force the issue.          The timing of that vote is unclear; the House is expected to recess for the winter holidays as soon as Thursday and not return until Jan. 7.          Blumenauer said that if McConnell does not agree to call the Democratic witnesses and stage a fair trial, Democrats could simply hold on to the articles indefinitely and continue to investigate Trump. The House is involved in multiple court cases seeking documents and testimony that have yet to be resolved.          “Who knows what would happen to augment the record? This ought to be able to play out,” he said. “There’s no advantage to rushing this.”          But the notion of prolonging the impeachment process indefinitely is almost certain to infuriate House members from competitive districts, who have pushed Pelosi for months to keep the investigation focused and limited to Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine.          Blumenauer declined to discuss whether members interested in the gambit would withhold their votes on naming managers to force the issue: “I’m not interested in sparking controversy in the caucus,” he said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\"The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.\" – George Orwell, \"1984\"          The Senate impeachment trial of President Trump ended not with a bang but a whimper. What different outcome could one expect from a trial without so much as a single witness, a single document, any cross-examination or a defendant respectful enough to show up? Law students are taught early on that a trial is not a grudge match or an ordeal; it is a search for the truth. Trial lawyers know that cross-examination is the most effective truth-testing tool available to them. But the search for the truth requires witnesses, and when the command from Senate Republican leaders came down that there shall be no witnesses, the truth-telling mission of Trump's trial was radically transformed into a steamroller of political power. GREGG JARRETT: TRUMP ACQUITTAL IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS A HUMILIATING DEFEAT FOR PARTISAN DEMOCRATS          And in its wake is a Congress ceding power to the presidency, almost as if the states had ratified a constitutional amendment redefining the impeachment language to permit a president to engage in high crimes and misdemeanors so long as he believes that they are in the national interest and so long as his party has an iron-clad grip on the Senate. How could presidential crimes be in the national interest? Here is the backstory. When the House of Representatives voted in favor of two articles of impeachment against Trump, it characterized his lawlessness as contempt of Congress and an abuse of power. The contempt of Congress consisted of Trump's orders to subordinates to disregard congressional subpoenas. Both Republican- and Democratic-controlled Houses of Representatives have deemed such presidential instructions in an impeachment inquiry as impeachable per se. The abuse allegations address Trump's solicitation of assistance for his reelection campaign from a foreign government by holding up the release of $391 million in military aid to the same foreign government. These funds were congressionally appropriated and ordered to be paid by legislation that Trump had signed into law. Federal law prohibits such solicitation as criminal and prohibits government officials from seeking personal favors in return for performing their governmental duties. The latter is bribery. Because the solicitation that Trump committed was a crime against the government, it is among those referred to when the Constitution was written as a \"high\" crime. High crimes are a constitutional basis for impeachment, along with bribery and treason. The evidence that Trump did this is overwhelming and beyond a reasonable doubt, and no one with firsthand knowledge denied it. Numerous government officials recounted that the presidential leverage of $391 million in U.S. assistance for a personal political favor did occur and the government's own watchdog concluded that it was indisputably unlawful. The favor Trump sought was an announcement by the Ukrainian government of the commencement of an investigation of Trump's potential presidential foe, former Vice President Joe Biden. While the Senate was hearing House prosecution managers argue their case, and Trump's lawyers challenged those arguments, The New York Times revealed that John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, had authored an as yet unpublished book demonstrating that the House case against Trump was true. True because, unlike the senators who shut their eyes and ears at Trump's trial, Bolton saw for himself the presidential tit-for-tat machinations that the House had alleged and, if proven, were criminal and impeachable. The Times also revealed the existence of 24 emails sent by Trump aides manifesting indisputably his lawless behavior. But the emails are secret. At the same time, two signal events occurred in the impeachment trial. The first was an argument by Trump's lawyers that every president seeking reelection believes his victory will be in the national interest and thus all presidential efforts toward that victory are constitutional and lawful. This morally bankrupt, intellectually dishonest argument – which effectively resuscitates from history's graveyard President Richard Nixon’s logic that \"when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal\" because the president is above the law – must have resonated with Senate Republican leaders. The leaders coerced their Senate Republican colleagues into embracing the view that – since the president did not want Bolton to testify or White House emails to be revealed – they must bar all witnesses and documents. The second signal event was shameful. It was the 51 to 49 Senate vote to bar witnesses and documents from the trial. Do innocent people behave this way? If Trump really believes he did not commit any crimes and any impeachable offenses, why would he orchestrate blocking evidence? And who – having taken an oath to do \"impartial justice\" – would close their eyes to the truth? How could such a marathon of speeches possibly be considered a trial? Trump will luxuriate in his victory. But the personal victory for him is a legal assault on the Constitution. The president has taken an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. Instead, he has trashed it. By manipulating Senate Republicans to bar firsthand evidence and keep it from senatorial and public scrutiny, Trump and his Senate collaborators have insulated him and future presidents from the moral and constitutional truism that no president is above the law.</td>\n",

Good mornings and in Canada Democrats are hoping to have witnesses testify as part of president trying to send trial that Republicans have already rejected that request to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hoping. Threatening to possibly delay president trumps trial. Could give her leverage. History put on hold president from becoming just the third president in US history to be impeached. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now refusing to take the next steps. Saying she wolf said articles of impeachment over to the set net. Until majority leader Mitch McConnell reveals with the president's trial will look like. Act founders owning both the constitution. They suspected that there could be a blow president. I don't think they suspected that with have a role president and rogue leader in the senate at the same time.

The issue coming up at last night's democratic debate. It president trop. Thinks that he should not be impeached he should not scared to what or where his own witnesses.

But for now at least Republicans aren't waiting. Looks like prosecutors are getting cold fate. In front of the entire country. And second guessing whether that you don't want the go to trial. President chopper responding on Twitter writing Pelosi is afraid to present impeachment to the senate. And adding so after Democrats gave me no due process in the house no lawyers no witnesses no nothing. They now want to tell the senate how to run their trial we think that what they did is unconstitutional.

       "61                         White House wants Senate trial rules to include ability to dismiss Trump charges  Republicans are debating including in the Senate resolution, which would govern the rules of the trial, a provision to dismiss the charges, something that would require 51 votes and would stop the trial in its tracks.          But moving ahead with a dismissal vote could put Republicans up for reelection in a tough spot if they are seen as moving too quickly to dismiss the case. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could not afford to lose more than two votes -- and GOP sources say the Kentucky Republican currently does not have enough votes to simply dismiss the case.          McConnell has made clear to his colleagues that he wants Trump to emerge victorious in the trial and is not willing to hold a vote that could fail, sources said. He's also keenly aware of what a vote to dismiss would look like politically, according to Republican senators, and has shepherded his conference away from the idea for several weeks.          Once the trial has begun, the Senate can vote on the merits of the articles of impeachment and choose to acquit Trump, something that can be done with only 34 votes because the Constitution requires 67 votes to convict the President and remove him from office. GOP proponents of this move argue Trump would have a stronger argument to say he was exonerated on the merits of the case, rather than simply relying on a procedural vote to dismiss the charges. Trump, though, might have to wait longer for a vote on acquittal to occur.          Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of McConnell's leadership team, said Monday he would prefer a vote to acquit the President on the merits, rather than seek a quick vote to dismiss the charges. \"That would be my advice. Let both sides have their say and have their vote.\" And Cornyn downplayed a weekend tweet from Trump calling for an \"outright dismissal.\" \"At different times, the President has expressed different views,\" Cornyn said. \"I wouldn't get too distracted by an intervening tweet.\" While Republicans are short of the votes to dismiss the charges, the issue remains a point of discussion due to McConnell's insistence that the initial rules of the trial hew closely to those used in President Bill Clinton's trial in 1999 . That resolution included a motion to dismiss, which failed. Republican senators this time around have been debating whether to remove it entirely, or push it further back in the proceedings than where it was structured then, senators familiar with the discussions said. The White House wants to keep the motion to dismiss in play because \"there's no reason to take options off the table at the beginning of the whole process,\" said one source familiar with the discussions. McConnell has counseled Republicans privately that they can decide how to proceed after both the House Democratic impeachment managers and President's defense team make their cases, followed by questions from senators. At that point, GOP senators must decide whether to allow witnesses, seek to acquit the President or move to dismiss the case. \"Yes, I am,\" Sen. Lamar Alexander, a retiring Tennessee Republican and McConnell confidante, said Monday when asked if he's open to witnesses. \"What I think is important is we have a vote on whether we need additional documents and witnesses. And that would only be appropriate after we've heard the case and asked our questions.\" That tracks directly with the model McConnell has touted now for weeks: a Senate resolution governing the trial that follow the procedures of Clinton's trial. In that Clinton resolution, the Senate included a motion to dismiss the charges after opening arguments were delivered and after senators asked their questions. About two weeks into the Clinton trial, Democrats forced a vote to dismiss the charges. But that dismissal measure failed, 44-56, and the trial continued for another two-and-half weeks. McConnell hinted last week that the Senate resolution would include a provision allowing the charges to be dismissed, but senators said the talks about how to handle the motion to dismiss still hadn't been finalized. \"We're going to have a similar resolution,\" McConnell told reporters. \"It may not be word for word, exactly the same, but a similar resolution. And we'll be glad to show it to you when -- when we unveil it.\" McConnell fueled Democratic concerns about dismissing the charges outright when he signed onto a resolution sponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, that would allow a senator to offer a motion to dismiss if the House did not transmit the articles of impeachment within 25 days. The viability of Hawley's resolution was viewed as limited to impossible -- it would require a Senate rule change, which would take 67 votes to occur. Republicans only control 53 seats in the chamber. McConnell could move to drop the vote threshold to 51, but it would require him to \"go nuclear,\" or move to eliminate the legislative filibuster, something he has long opposed. A source familiar with McConnell's decision to support the resolution said he backed \"the spirit\" of Hawley's idea given the frustration over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to hold onto the articles for more than three weeks, but wasn't planning to push forward on it given its prospects. Pelosi's about to hit send on the impeachment articles But McConnell's decision to sign onto the idea drew sharp criticism from Pelosi, who demanded to see the Senate resolution and understand how the dismissal provision would be structured before sending over the articles of impeachment that would initiate the trial. She ultimately relented and indicated that the articles would be sent over this week. ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Dismissing is a coverup ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Over the weekend, Trump argued that having a trial would add credibility to the Democrats' case, calling for a dismissal of the charges. \"Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, 'no pressure' Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have,\" Trump tweeted. \"I agree!\" This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.\n",

A magnetometer in the Senate press gallery will require reporters to trickle into the chamber one at a time. Electronic devices will be banned, leaving reporters to scuttle in and out of the room to send tweets and emails. Reporters will be placed in pens, roping them off and restricting their ability to speak freely with senators as they enter and exit.          “Currently,” Wire tweeted, “we can walk with Senators as they enter the chamber, wait for them outside of meetings or lunches. It leads to a diversity of voices. Penning us means people across the country might not hear from their senator.”          Officials have also proposed limiting video coverage of the arrival of the articles of impeachment to a single pool camera with no audio, she said.          “These potential restrictions fail to acknowledge what currently works on Capitol Hill, or the way the American public expects to be able to follow a vital news event about their government in the digital age,” the committee’s letter read.          Details about the nature and scope of the restrictions under consideration remained unclear, as neither the Senate sergeant at arms nor the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, which are responsible for them, has issued a formal document.          “You’ll have to decide where’s the best place to watch; it’s like watching a football game,” Blunt said. “Where’s the best place to watch it?”          Blunt told the Star that while most of the trial will be broadcast, other segments will be closed, in line with procedures during the trial of President Bill Clinton in early 1999. “I mean closed session,” he said. “I mean there will be nobody there but senators and essential staff. No cameras, no C-SPAN, no coverage.”          He said that “part of the decision about access” for reporters to senators “will be driven by how quickly you can clear the room” for the closed sessions, “so you can have that debate and get people back into the room so you can move forward.”          Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, called the restrictions “a big mistake” in comments to reporters after Tuesday night’s Democratic candidate debate in Des Moines, where she is campaigning for the party’s presidential nomination.          The correspondents’ committee said members raised concerns with the sergeant at arms and the Rules Committee. “But decisions are being made quickly as plans for the trial are completed,” the letter read, “and we are hearing that nearly every suggestion has been rejected without an explanation of how the restrictions contribute to safety rather than simply limit coverage of the trial.”          News of the restrictions prompted alarm online from reporters, with some protesting the move as one that will effectively shield senators from scrutiny during the trial.\n",

Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said Wednesday, as his colleagues debated the impeachment articles on the House floor, that he has spoken to three dozen Democratic lawmakers who had expressed some level of enthusiasm for the idea of “rounding out the record and spending the time to do this right.”          Another Democrat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said there is “serious concern about whether there will be a fair trial on the Senate side” and acknowledged active talks about withholding the articles.          The notion has been most prominently advocated by Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor who has advised the House Judiciary Committee on the impeachment process. In a recent medianame op-ed, he wrote that “the public has a right to observe a meaningful trial rather than simply learn that the result is a verdict of not guilty.”          Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has asked McConnell to call several Trump administration witnesses, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. McConnell has dismissed those requests and signaled that he expects to hold a relatively short trial that will end with a summary dismissal of the impeachment charges.          Republicans have scoffed at the notion of the House withholding the articles, noting it hardly counts as leverage to deny the GOP the ability to remove a president that the party wants to keep in place. Some aides further argued that withholding the articles would only fuel Republican arguments that Democrats are engaged in a partisan abuse of the Constitution.          But Democratic leaders may be forced to deal with the issue in the coming days. Blumenauer said he had already raised it with Pelosi (Calif.), House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (Md.) and other top party leaders.          Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Hoyer did not rule out the idea: “It’s an interesting proposal. I don’t think that that’s the path we will follow, but that does not mean we will immediately deliver it. There are considerations related to other legislation.”          A senior Democratic aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations said the impeachment articles will not be immediately transmitted to the Senate on Wednesday. Rather, they will be held until Pelosi names impeachment managers, the House members who will present the case for Trump’s removal in the Senate.          “There will be a debate and vote on that resolution” naming the managers, the aide said. If a significant number of Democrats refuse to vote for that resolution, they could force the issue.          The timing of that vote is unclear; the House is expected to recess for the winter holidays as soon as Thursday and not return until Jan. 7.          Blumenauer said that if McConnell does not agree to call the Democratic witnesses and stage a fair trial, Democrats could simply hold on to the articles indefinitely and continue to investigate Trump. The House is involved in multiple court cases seeking documents and testimony that have yet to be resolved.          “Who knows what would happen to augment the record? This ought to be able to play out,” he said. “There’s no advantage to rushing this.”          But the notion of prolonging the impeachment process indefinitely is almost certain to infuriate House members from competitive districts, who have pushed Pelosi for months to keep the investigation focused and limited to Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine.          Blumenauer declined to discuss whether members interested in the gambit would withhold their votes on naming managers to force the issue: “I’m not interested in sparking controversy in the caucus,” he said.\n",

It was their final, most essential command.\" – George Orwell, \"1984\"          The Senate impeachment trial of President Trump ended not with a bang but a whimper. What different outcome could one expect from a trial without so much as a single witness, a single document, any cross-examination or a defendant respectful enough to show up? Law students are taught early on that a trial is not a grudge match or an ordeal; it is a search for the truth. Trial lawyers know that cross-examination is the most effective truth-testing tool available to them. But the search for the truth requires witnesses, and when the command from Senate Republican leaders came down that there shall be no witnesses, the truth-telling mission of Trump's trial was radically transformed into a steamroller of political power. GREGG JARRETT: TRUMP ACQUITTAL IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS A HUMILIATING DEFEAT FOR PARTISAN DEMOCRATS          And in its wake is a Congress ceding power to the presidency, almost as if the states had ratified a constitutional amendment redefining the impeachment language to permit a president to engage in high crimes and misdemeanors so long as he believes that they are in the national interest and so long as his party has an iron-clad grip on the Senate. How could presidential crimes be in the national interest? Here is the backstory. When the House of Representatives voted in favor of two articles of impeachment against Trump, it characterized his lawlessness as contempt of Congress and an abuse of power. The contempt of Congress consisted of Trump's orders to subordinates to disregard congressional subpoenas. Both Republican- and Democratic-controlled Houses of Representatives have deemed such presidential instructions in an impeachment inquiry as impeachable per se. The abuse allegations address Trump's solicitation of assistance for his reelection campaign from a foreign government by holding up the release of $391 million in military aid to the same foreign government. These funds were congressionally appropriated and ordered to be paid by legislation that Trump had signed into law. Federal law prohibits such solicitation as criminal and prohibits government officials from seeking personal favors in return for performing their governmental duties. The latter is bribery. Because the solicitation that Trump committed was a crime against the government, it is among those referred to when the Constitution was written as a \"high\" crime. High crimes are a constitutional basis for impeachment, along with bribery and treason. The evidence that Trump did this is overwhelming and beyond a reasonable doubt, and no one with firsthand knowledge denied it. Numerous government officials recounted that the presidential leverage of $391 million in U.S. assistance for a personal political favor did occur and the government's own watchdog concluded that it was indisputably unlawful. The favor Trump sought was an announcement by the Ukrainian government of the commencement of an investigation of Trump's potential presidential foe, former Vice President Joe Biden. While the Senate was hearing House prosecution managers argue their case, and Trump's lawyers challenged those arguments, The New York Times revealed that John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, had authored an as yet unpublished book demonstrating that the House case against Trump was true. True because, unlike the senators who shut their eyes and ears at Trump's trial, Bolton saw for himself the presidential tit-for-tat machinations that the House had alleged and, if proven, were criminal and impeachable. The Times also revealed the existence of 24 emails sent by Trump aides manifesting indisputably his lawless behavior. But the emails are secret. At the same time, two signal events occurred in the impeachment trial. The first was an argument by Trump's lawyers that every president seeking reelection believes his victory will be in the national interest and thus all presidential efforts toward that victory are constitutional and lawful. This morally bankrupt, intellectually dishonest argument – which effectively resuscitates from history's graveyard President Richard Nixon’s logic that \"when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal\" because the president is above the law – must have resonated with Senate Republican leaders. The leaders coerced their Senate Republican colleagues into embracing the view that – since the president did not want Bolton to testify or White House emails to be revealed – they must bar all witnesses and documents. The second signal event was shameful. It was the 51 to 49 Senate vote to bar witnesses and documents from the trial. Do innocent people behave this way? If Trump really believes he did not commit any crimes and any impeachable offenses, why would he orchestrate blocking evidence? And who – having taken an oath to do \"impartial justice\" – would close their eyes to the truth? How could such a marathon of speeches possibly be considered a trial? Trump will luxuriate in his victory. But the personal victory for him is a legal assault on the Constitution. The president has taken an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. Instead, he has trashed it. By manipulating Senate Republicans to bar firsthand evidence and keep it from senatorial and public scrutiny, Trump and his Senate collaborators have insulated him and future presidents from the moral and constitutional truism that no president is above the law.\n",

President trop is looking for the GOP senate for vindication but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It's throwing a wrench in the plans medianame the nest Iraq or Tara has the latest from Washington and that's good morning. Good mornings and in Canada Democrats are hoping to have witnesses testify as part of president trying to send trial that Republicans have already rejected that request to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hoping. Threatening to possibly delay president trumps trial. Could give her leverage. History put on hold president from becoming just the third president in US history to be impeached. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now refusing to take the next steps. Saying she wolf said articles of impeachment over to the set net. Until majority leader Mitch McConnell reveals with the president's trial will look like. Act founders owning both the constitution. They suspected that there could be a blow president. I don't think they suspected that with have a role president and rogue leader in the senate at the same time. Democrats have been pushing to hear from four witnesses the White House had blocked from testifying. Including acting chief of staff make Maldini and former national security advisor John Bolton. The issue coming up at last night's democratic debate. It president trop. Thinks that he should not be impeached he should not scared to what or where his own witnesses. But McConnell has already rejected that request. Indicating he wants a speedy trial and that he's working in total coordination with the White House Democrats are hoping threatening to possibly delay trumps trial will give them leverage. But for now at least Republicans aren't waiting. Looks like prosecutors are getting cold fate. In front of the entire country. And second guessing whether that you don't want the go to trial. President chopper responding on Twitter writing Pelosi is afraid to present impeachment to the senate. And adding so after Democrats gave me no due process in the house no lawyers no witnesses no nothing. They now want to tell the senate how to run their trial we think that what they did is unconstitutional. And lawmakers are hoping to have that senate trial begin the week of January 6 but that will all depend on when house speaker Pelosi decides to send those articles of impeachment. Over to the senate to name Kenneth."

       "      <td>President Donald Trump cycled through a range of conflicting reactions Tuesday as Democrats moved swiftly toward concrete congressional action on impeachment.          The president moved from dismissing the renewed push by Democrats for impeachment proceedings early in the day to bemoaning the effort's impact while holding meetings with world leaders at the United Nations just a few hours later, to expressing social media outrage over \"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\" as evening fell.          \"Pelosi, Nadler, Schiff and, of course, Maxine Waters! Can you believe this?\" he asked in a late afternoon tweetstorm shortly after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry. By Wednesday morning, Trump lamented on Twitter that there \"has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have.\"          \"The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear,\" he continued, additionally calling the new impeachment push a \"Witch Hunt!\"          Meanwhile, the day's impeachment developments were being met inside his inner circle with a mix of trepidation and defiance, as the president and his allies entered what they acknowledged was uncharted territory, according to multiple sources familiar with their thinking.          Pelosi's move followed growing outrage among Democrats at Trump's reported pressure on Ukraine's president to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden while that country was awaiting U.S. aid he'd delayed, including a request during a summer phone call between the two leaders.          Early Tuesday, Trump dismissed the Democratic outrage as partisan posturing. “I think it’s a ridiculous witch hunt,” Trump said ahead of his morning remarks at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, reviving some of the same pushback he used during former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. “I’m leading in the polls. The only way they can stop me is impeachment.”          Download the medianame News app for breaking news and politics          As news broke later in the day that Pelosi planned to announce a formal impeachment inquiry, Trump said that he would release a transcript Wednesday morning.          \"You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,\" he tweeted. \"...This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\"          Democrats have called for the full release of a complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower that is said to include, but not be limited to, that call. A senior administration official said the White House was preparing to turn over the whistleblower complaint by this Thursday.          Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said a lawyer for the whistleblower had contacted his committee saying they would like to testify, and that the panel has requested guidance from the acting Director of National Intelligence on how to move forward.          Later Tuesday afternoon, ahead of a meeting by Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss potential action, the president accused the party of failing to take action on a range of issues, including gun safety, due to presidential investigations. “So bad for our Country!” he tweeted.          Then, during a meeting with the Iraqi president, he ran through a list of U.S. economic indicators, saying \"the country’s doing the best it’s ever done, and I just heard that [Pelosi would] like to impeach.\"          \"...If she does that, they all say that’s a positive for me in the election,\" he said. \"You could also say: who needs it, it’s bad for the country.”          Trump's damage control efforts on the domestic front Tuesday came as he looked to make his mark on the world stage, making a speech to the United Nations General Assembly and holding a string of meetings with world leaders.          \"Such an important day at the United Nations,\" he tweeted Tuesday afternoon, moments after Pelosi's announcement. \"So much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!\"          While Democrats have spent the last two years calling for various lines of impeachment, Pelosi is now triggering an official process that could translate to months of hearings, subpoenas and witness testimony — and, potentially, both new revelations and the passage of articles of impeachment as the president battles for re-election.          There is no indication yet that Trump could be removed from office, which would require a two-thirds vote from the Republican-led Senate.          More than two-thirds of House Democrats now back some type of impeachment action — still not enough to claim the simple House majority needed to pass articles of impeachment if the rest of the caucus does not go along, but a significant increase since last week.          On Monday, The Washington Post and other media outlets reported that Trump instructed his chief of staff to place a hold on $400 million in military aid for Ukraine in the days before a late July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.          Trump told reporters Tuesday that his request to withhold the aid was due to his desire to see greater European contributions to Ukraine’s defense, and not linked to whether the country would investigate the Biden family, which media outlets have reported Trump brought up on the call with Zelensky.          Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday he was never given an explanation for why the funds were being withheld, despite pressing senior administration officials about it at the time.          The White House has publicly sought to link the latest controversy — over whether Trump sought help from a foreign country to go after one of his chief political rivals — to the Russia election meddling investigation, which they have asserted exonerated the president, though it listed numerous instances of possible obstruction of justice.          “The media pushed the Russia lie for almost three years with no evidence, and now they are doing it all over again,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told medianame News in a statement Monday. “These allegations are completely false, but because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they’ll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this president.”          Trump's campaign has also argued that the latest effort is another attempt by the Democrats to overturn the 2016 election results.          \"They’ve always wanted to impeach him, and they’ve just been shopping around for an excuse,\" said Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh.          McConnell's reaction to the news late Tuesday echoed the White House's line of attack, accusing Democrats of “searching for ways to reverse their 2016 election defeat since before President Trump was even inaugurated and a \"rush to judgment\" and saying the move “simply confirms that House Democrats’ priority is not making life better for the American people but their nearly three-year-old fixation on impeachment.”          So did House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's. \"I realize 2016 did not turn out the way Speaker Pelosi wanted it to happen,\" said McCarthy, R-Calif. \"But she cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide we’re in an impeachment inquiry.\" House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, like the president, called the impeachment push a \"witch hunt\" that was being \"used to try to go and usurp the results of an election in 2016.\"          While sources close to the president said they didn’t want to see impeachment, they were prepared to argue it could be “helpful” in mobilizing the core supporters inside the president’s base.          Some allies predicted the move would backfire on Democrats, particularly if the transcript being released Wednesday failed to show a smoking gun — and the president’s campaign was already working to capitalize on the upcoming impeachment fight.          Over the course of several hours, the campaign sent multiple fundraising pitches to supporters, including the launch of an “Official Impeachment Defense Task Force.\" It also released a video attacking Democrats calling for impeachment, which Murtaugh said had been \"ready for weeks in case the Democrats were that dumb. And they were.”          Inside the White House, this round of impeachment talks was viewed as more politically perilous than during the Russia investigation, said one White House aide. Whether and how the White House is able to spin the transcript — and what the polling indicates over the next few days — will determine if this is yet another scandal to weather or a marked shift in public sentiment, the aide said.          Ahead of the Pelosi announcement, Republicans in Congress had been largely silent on the issue, with allies backing his allegations of corruption by Biden. The most critical GOP reaction came from Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who told medianame News Monday that Trump “should make available the whistleblower complaint that has been deemed to be credible and urgent.\"          \"I think it'd be very helpful to get the bottom of the facts,\" Romney said. \"If they don't, it will be up to the House to decide how to proceed.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>McCarthy Fires Back At Pelosi After Impeachment Calls: ‘Cannot Change The Laws’</td>\n",
       "      <td>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy fired back at Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi after she came out in favor of the impeachment of President Donald Trump for the first time Tuesday after meeting with her caucus.          In a Tuesday night press conference on Capitol Hill, McCarthy said Pelosi’s calls for impeachment are due to the Democrats losing the presidency in 2016, saying this is proof they have not yet got over the election. McCarthy also said their job is to legislate, not to continue to find dirt on the President.          “This election is over. I realize 2016 did not turn out the way Speaker Pelosi wanted it to happen. But she cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide when an impeachment inquiry,” McCarthy said to reporters. What she said today made no difference of what’s been going on.” (RELATED: Nancy Pelosi Comes Out In Favor Of Impeachment)          Pelosi then publicly announced late Tuesday afternoon, “Today I’m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.” (RELATED: McCarthy Meets With US Trade Rep Robert Lighthizer About USMCA)          Despite Pelosi’s early reluctance to push for impeachment, there are currently 174 Democrats who support impeachment or an impeachment inquiry, compared to the 61 Democrats who do not yet support impeachment or impeachment inquiry. Pelosi has said she believes Trump is “goading” Democrats to impeach him because he thinks it will help him fire up his base.          Many of Pelosi’s Democratic colleagues have continued to push for impeaching Trump, such as Democratic Texas Rep. Al Green, who broke with Pelosi when he vowed to force a vote to impeach Trump in late March. Green, who previously had several bills to impeach Trump overwhelmingly rejected by the House of Representatives, called for a third impeachment vote. Pelosi said impeachment was “just not worth it” in a March interview.</td>\n",

       "      <td>'Democrats should be ashamed': White House admonishes House for moving forward with impeachment</td>\n",
       "      <td>White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham ridiculed the Democratic Party moments after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House of Representatives will move forward with a vote on impeaching President Trump.          On Thursday morning, Pelosi said that the House will draft up articles of impeachment as a result of President Trump's \"failure to faithfully execute the law.\" She added that they have gathered evidence from weeks of testimony in front of the House Intelligence Committee.          \"[Pelosi and] the Democrats should be ashamed. [Trump] has done nothing but lead our country - resulting in a booming economy, more jobs [and] a stronger military, to name just a few of his major accomplishments. We look forward to a fair trial in the Senate,\" Grisham tweeted.          Pelosi did not describe the impeachment articles or the timeline during her press conference, but Democrats have outlined a case that will likely focus on alleged abuses of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats are hoping to finish impeachment “expeditiously,” and are hoping to vote on the articles before the House adjourns for the year on December 20.          Democrats allege that Trump tried to bribe Ukraine government officials into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden by temporarily withholding $391 million in security aid until the investigation was agreed upon. The president has repeatedly denied the accusations and defended his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, which led to a whistleblower coming forward.          Trump weighed in preemptively on Twitter saying, \"The Do Nothing Democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the House. They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them, they have gone crazy. Therefore I say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair....\" He added in a subsequent tweet, \".....trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business. We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is. I was elected to “Clean the Swamp,” and that’s what I am doing!\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Marc Thiessen says Nancy Pelosi impeachment trial stalemate backfired: 'She has no leverage with Republicans'</td>\n",
       "      <td>Former White House speechwriter Marc Thiessen on Friday laid out how House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to withhold from the Senate articles of impeachment against President Trump has backfired. “Nancy Pelosi has a gun to her own head and is threatening to shoot, and Republicans should say, 'Make my day,'” Thiessen told “America’s Newsroom.”          TRUMP CALLS DEMS 'LIARS!' FOR DEEMING HIM SECURITY THREAT – AND THEN PAUSING IMPEACHMENT          Thiessen asserted that Pelosi does not have leverage with Republicans and noted popular support for impeachment has declined. If there was any Christmas truce between President Trump and Pelosi, it didn't last long. The president went so far Thursday morning as to suggest Pelosi should face a primary challenge, as he called her San Francisco district \"filthy\" and \"dirty\" and said she should focus on cleaning it up. Earlier Monday morning, the president tore into House Democrats over their handling of the impeachment process, calling them \"hypocrites\" and \"liars\" for allegedly seeking concessions in the Senate that Republicans were not afforded in the House -- and for hitting pause on impeachment after stressing the national security urgency of it all. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WHY IS PELOSI HOLDING THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT? DC INSIDERS HAVE SOME THEORIES          Despite this assessment, the impeachment process has stalled after Pelosi abruptly opted not to deliver articles of impeachment to the Senate, after the House adopted two articles alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for Trump's actions in Ukraine. Thiessen asserted that the House Democrats’ impeachment push backfired because popular support for removal of Trump declined. Thiessen went on to say, “That argument gets weaker every week that goes by that the articles haven’t impeached because, if you want unfairness, how about accusing the president of high crimes and misdemeanors and denying him a trial to defend himself.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mark Levin blasts Pelosi, Dems' 'rogue' push to impeach Trump</td>\n",
       "      <td>Mark Levin ripped House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for initiating an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, claiming she is going about the process in a rogue manner. Pelosi wrongfully quoted Ben Franklin, a signatory of the Constitution from Pennsylvania and otherwise accomplished little of substance through her remarks, Levin claimed Tuesday on \"The Mark Levin Show on Westwood One.\" \"She wouldn't take a vote on the House floor and she's in charge of scheduling... because she's still trying to protect 30, 40, 50 of her members,\" he said. \"One person from San Francisco -- one House district -- she has determined to launch a formal impeachment inquiry -- that's not what the Constitution calls for... Then, she cites the Constitution and Benjamin Franklin -- the same party that attacks the Constitution day in and day out, that attacks the... ratifiers of the Constitution day in and day out.\" He said that instead of bringing articles of impeachment to the House floor for a vote, she enlisted six committee chairs: Reps. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., Richard Neal, D-Mass., Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Maxine Waters, D-Calif., Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., to gather evidence and president it to herself and Nadler, who would make the ultimate determination on whether to hold an impeachment vote. \"She said... during the course of her mini-press-event that she is directing the six chairmen of these six committees to work together and provide their information to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler,\" he said. The \"Life, Liberty &amp; Levin\" host called the impeachment inquiry a \"pseudo-event in the un-reality that they created to humiliate the president.\" He added he believed the situation is little more than a campaign effort by Democrats hoping to undermine Trump's 2020 chances. \"It must be taken very seriously and it must be fought every step of the way,\" he said, adding the American people -- in the form of the full House -- should decide the future of the presidency and not a, \"rogue, radical Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.\"</td>\n",

       "302                                                     Trump vents over Pelosi impeachment push over Ukraine call  President Donald Trump cycled through a range of conflicting reactions Tuesday as Democrats moved swiftly toward concrete congressional action on impeachment.          The president moved from dismissing the renewed push by Democrats for impeachment proceedings early in the day to bemoaning the effort's impact while holding meetings with world leaders at the United Nations just a few hours later, to expressing social media outrage over \"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\" as evening fell.          \"Pelosi, Nadler, Schiff and, of course, Maxine Waters! Can you believe this?\" he asked in a late afternoon tweetstorm shortly after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry. By Wednesday morning, Trump lamented on Twitter that there \"has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have.\"          \"The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear,\" he continued, additionally calling the new impeachment push a \"Witch Hunt!\"          Meanwhile, the day's impeachment developments were being met inside his inner circle with a mix of trepidation and defiance, as the president and his allies entered what they acknowledged was uncharted territory, according to multiple sources familiar with their thinking.          Pelosi's move followed growing outrage among Democrats at Trump's reported pressure on Ukraine's president to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden while that country was awaiting U.S. aid he'd delayed, including a request during a summer phone call between the two leaders.          Early Tuesday, Trump dismissed the Democratic outrage as partisan posturing. “I think it’s a ridiculous witch hunt,” Trump said ahead of his morning remarks at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, reviving some of the same pushback he used during former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. “I’m leading in the polls. The only way they can stop me is impeachment.”          Download the medianame News app for breaking news and politics          As news broke later in the day that Pelosi planned to announce a formal impeachment inquiry, Trump said that he would release a transcript Wednesday morning.          \"You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,\" he tweeted. \"...This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\"          Democrats have called for the full release of a complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower that is said to include, but not be limited to, that call. A senior administration official said the White House was preparing to turn over the whistleblower complaint by this Thursday.          Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said a lawyer for the whistleblower had contacted his committee saying they would like to testify, and that the panel has requested guidance from the acting Director of National Intelligence on how to move forward.          Later Tuesday afternoon, ahead of a meeting by Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss potential action, the president accused the party of failing to take action on a range of issues, including gun safety, due to presidential investigations. “So bad for our Country!” he tweeted.          Then, during a meeting with the Iraqi president, he ran through a list of U.S. economic indicators, saying \"the country’s doing the best it’s ever done, and I just heard that [Pelosi would] like to impeach.\"          \"...If she does that, they all say that’s a positive for me in the election,\" he said. \"You could also say: who needs it, it’s bad for the country.”          Trump's damage control efforts on the domestic front Tuesday came as he looked to make his mark on the world stage, making a speech to the United Nations General Assembly and holding a string of meetings with world leaders.          \"Such an important day at the United Nations,\" he tweeted Tuesday afternoon, moments after Pelosi's announcement. \"So much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!\"          While Democrats have spent the last two years calling for various lines of impeachment, Pelosi is now triggering an official process that could translate to months of hearings, subpoenas and witness testimony — and, potentially, both new revelations and the passage of articles of impeachment as the president battles for re-election.          There is no indication yet that Trump could be removed from office, which would require a two-thirds vote from the Republican-led Senate.          More than two-thirds of House Democrats now back some type of impeachment action — still not enough to claim the simple House majority needed to pass articles of impeachment if the rest of the caucus does not go along, but a significant increase since last week.          On Monday, The Washington Post and other media outlets reported that Trump instructed his chief of staff to place a hold on $400 million in military aid for Ukraine in the days before a late July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.          Trump told reporters Tuesday that his request to withhold the aid was due to his desire to see greater European contributions to Ukraine’s defense, and not linked to whether the country would investigate the Biden family, which media outlets have reported Trump brought up on the call with Zelensky.          Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday he was never given an explanation for why the funds were being withheld, despite pressing senior administration officials about it at the time.          The White House has publicly sought to link the latest controversy — over whether Trump sought help from a foreign country to go after one of his chief political rivals — to the Russia election meddling investigation, which they have asserted exonerated the president, though it listed numerous instances of possible obstruction of justice.          “The media pushed the Russia lie for almost three years with no evidence, and now they are doing it all over again,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told medianame News in a statement Monday. “These allegations are completely false, but because the media wants this story to be true so badly, they’ll once again manufacture a frenzy and drive ignorant, fake stories to attack this president.”          Trump's campaign has also argued that the latest effort is another attempt by the Democrats to overturn the 2016 election results.          \"They’ve always wanted to impeach him, and they’ve just been shopping around for an excuse,\" said Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh.          McConnell's reaction to the news late Tuesday echoed the White House's line of attack, accusing Democrats of “searching for ways to reverse their 2016 election defeat since before President Trump was even inaugurated and a \"rush to judgment\" and saying the move “simply confirms that House Democrats’ priority is not making life better for the American people but their nearly three-year-old fixation on impeachment.”          So did House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's. \"I realize 2016 did not turn out the way Speaker Pelosi wanted it to happen,\" said McCarthy, R-Calif. \"But she cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide we’re in an impeachment inquiry.\" House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, like the president, called the impeachment push a \"witch hunt\" that was being \"used to try to go and usurp the results of an election in 2016.\"          While sources close to the president said they didn’t want to see impeachment, they were prepared to argue it could be “helpful” in mobilizing the core supporters inside the president’s base.          Some allies predicted the move would backfire on Democrats, particularly if the transcript being released Wednesday failed to show a smoking gun — and the president’s campaign was already working to capitalize on the upcoming impeachment fight.          Over the course of several hours, the campaign sent multiple fundraising pitches to supporters, including the launch of an “Official Impeachment Defense Task Force.\" It also released a video attacking Democrats calling for impeachment, which Murtaugh said had been \"ready for weeks in case the Democrats were that dumb. And they were.”          Inside the White House, this round of impeachment talks was viewed as more politically perilous than during the Russia investigation, said one White House aide. Whether and how the White House is able to spin the transcript — and what the polling indicates over the next few days — will determine if this is yet another scandal to weather or a marked shift in public sentiment, the aide said.          Ahead of the Pelosi announcement, Republicans in Congress had been largely silent on the issue, with allies backing his allegations of corruption by Biden. The most critical GOP reaction came from Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who told medianame News Monday that Trump “should make available the whistleblower complaint that has been deemed to be credible and urgent.\"          \"I think it'd be very helpful to get the bottom of the facts,\" Romney said. \"If they don't, it will be up to the House to decide how to proceed.”\n",

she came out in favor of the impeachment of President Donald Trump for the first time Tuesday after meeting with her caucus.          In a Tuesday night press conference on Capitol Hill, McCarthy said Pelosi’s calls for impeachment are due to the Democrats losing the presidency in 2016, saying this is proof they have not yet got over the election. McCarthy also said their job is to legislate, not to continue to find dirt on the President.          “This election is over. I realize 2016 did not turn out the way Speaker Pelosi wanted it to happen. But she cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide when an impeachment inquiry,” McCarthy said to reporters. What she said today made no difference of what’s been going on.” (RELATED: Nancy Pelosi Comes Out In Favor Of Impeachment)          Pelosi then publicly announced late Tuesday afternoon, “Today I’m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.” (RELATED: McCarthy Meets With US Trade Rep Robert Lighthizer About USMCA)          Despite Pelosi’s early reluctance to push for impeachment, there are currently 174 Democrats who support impeachment or an impeachment inquiry, compared to the 61 Democrats who do not yet support impeachment or impeachment inquiry. Pelosi has said she believes Trump is “goading” Democrats to impeach him because he thinks it will help him fire up his base.          Many of Pelosi’s Democratic colleagues have continued to push for impeaching Trump, such as Democratic Texas Rep. Al Green, who broke with Pelosi when he vowed to force a vote to impeach Trump in late March. Green, who previously had several bills to impeach Trump overwhelmingly rejected by the House of Representatives, called for a third impeachment vote. Pelosi said impeachment was “just not worth it” in a March interview.\n",

of Representatives will move forward with a vote on impeaching President Trump.          On Thursday morning, Pelosi said that the House will draft up articles of impeachment as a result of President Trump's \"failure to faithfully execute the law.\" She added that they have gathered evidence from weeks of testimony in front of the House Intelligence Committee.          \"[Pelosi and] the Democrats should be ashamed. [Trump] has done nothing but lead our country - resulting in a booming economy, more jobs [and] a stronger military, to name just a few of his major accomplishments. We look forward to a fair trial in the Senate,\" Grisham tweeted.          Pelosi did not describe the impeachment articles or the timeline during her press conference, but Democrats have outlined a case that will likely focus on alleged abuses of power and obstruction of Congress. Democrats are hoping to finish impeachment “expeditiously,” and are hoping to vote on the articles before the House adjourns for the year on December 20.          Democrats allege that Trump tried to bribe Ukraine government officials into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden by temporarily withholding $391 million in security aid until the investigation was agreed upon. The president has repeatedly denied the accusations and defended his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, which led to a whistleblower coming forward.          Trump weighed in preemptively on Twitter saying, \"The Do Nothing Democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the House. They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them, they have gone crazy. Therefore I say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair....\" He added in a subsequent tweet, \".....trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business. We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is. I was elected to “Clean the Swamp,” and that’s what I am doing!\"\n",

withhold from the Senate articles of impeachment against President Trump has backfired. “Nancy Pelosi has a gun to her own head and is threatening to shoot, and Republicans should say, 'Make my day,'” Thiessen told “America’s Newsroom.”          TRUMP CALLS DEMS 'LIARS!' FOR DEEMING HIM SECURITY THREAT – AND THEN PAUSING IMPEACHMENT          Thiessen asserted that Pelosi does not have leverage with Republicans and noted popular support for impeachment has declined. If there was any Christmas truce between President Trump and Pelosi, it didn't last long. The president went so far Thursday morning as to suggest Pelosi should face a primary challenge, as he called her San Francisco district \"filthy\" and \"dirty\" and said she should focus on cleaning it up. Earlier Monday morning, the president tore into House Democrats over their handling of the impeachment process, calling them \"hypocrites\" and \"liars\" for allegedly seeking concessions in the Senate that Republicans were not afforded in the House -- and for hitting pause on impeachment after stressing the national security urgency of it all. REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: WHY IS PELOSI HOLDING THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT? DC INSIDERS HAVE SOME THEORIES          Despite this assessment, the impeachment process has stalled after Pelosi abruptly opted not to deliver articles of impeachment to the Senate, after the House adopted two articles alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for Trump's actions in Ukraine. Thiessen asserted that the House Democrats’ impeachment push backfired because popular support for removal of Trump declined. Thiessen went on to say, “That argument gets weaker every week that goes by that the articles haven’t impeached because, if you want unfairness, how about accusing the president of high crimes and misdemeanors and denying him a trial to defend himself.”\n",

Pelosi, D-Calif., for initiating an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, claiming she is going about the process in a rogue manner. Pelosi wrongfully quoted Ben Franklin, a signatory of the Constitution from Pennsylvania and otherwise accomplished little of substance through her remarks, Levin claimed Tuesday on \"The Mark Levin Show on Westwood One.\" \"She wouldn't take a vote on the House floor and she's in charge of scheduling... because she's still trying to protect 30, 40, 50 of her members,\" he said. \"One person from San Francisco -- one House district -- she has determined to launch a formal impeachment inquiry -- that's not what the Constitution calls for... Then, she cites the Constitution and Benjamin Franklin -- the same party that attacks the Constitution day in and day out, that attacks the... ratifiers of the Constitution day in and day out.\" He said that instead of bringing articles of impeachment to the House floor for a vote, she enlisted six committee chairs: Reps. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., Richard Neal, D-Mass., Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Maxine Waters, D-Calif., Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., to gather evidence and president it to herself and Nadler, who would make the ultimate determination on whether to hold an impeachment vote. \"She said... during the course of her mini-press-event that she is directing the six chairmen of these six committees to work together and provide their information to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler,\" he said. The \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" host called the impeachment inquiry a \"pseudo-event in the un-reality that they created to humiliate the president.\" He added he believed the situation is little more than a campaign effort by Democrats hoping to undermine Trump's 2020 chances. \"It must be taken very seriously and it must be fought every step of the way,\" he said, adding the American people -- in the form of the full House -- should decide the future of the presidency and not a, \"rogue, radical Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.\""

       "      <td>Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) on Monday said an intelligence official’s complaint that President Trump sought help from Ukraine in the 2020 elections “is starting to seem like a political setup.”          Cheney tweeted a clip of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) appearing to admit she knew what was in the transcript of a July 25 Trump phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky even before the White House released the transcript of the call last Wednesday.          Pelosi, in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS News 60 Minutes, said Trump called her and they discussed the phone call before the transcript was released.          According to the New York Times, Trump and Pelosi’s phone call took place on Tuesday. The White House released the transcript on Wednesday.          But Pelosi said during the interview about her call with Trump, “He told me it was perfect. There was nothing in the call. But I know what was in the call.

       "      <td>Nancy Pelosi's wretched, saccharine speech fits her shoddy impeachment</td>\n",
       "      <td>Nancy Pelosi began the impeachment debate Wednesday afternoon with a wretchedly written speech proclaiming herself \"solemn\" and \"sad,\" and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.          As unwoke as it is to recite the Pledge (probably racist by the Left's current rules), what's truly shocking is that Pelosi didn't bother to prepare anything substantive or even any compelling rhetoric for her speech. If you literally begin your speech about impeachment by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, it means that you assigned your junior speechwriter to write this speech, probably the night before.          Grave moments call upon leaders to make serious arguments — to make their oratory match the moment. That can be done in many ways. Lincoln did it at Gettysburg with honest gravity and brevity. Reagan did it at the Brandenburg Gate with directness. Churchill, Kennedy, and the other leaders of last century, who faced actually \"solemn\" moments, rose to the occasion by injecting poetry, originality, and eloquence.          Pelosi, in contrast, kicked off her supposedly grave impeachment with a string of half-relevant quotations and piles and piles of melodrama (at one point she uttered the words \"dancing with angels\"). Her party responded with forced applause.          It was a shoddy speech to begin a rushed and shoddy impeachment process.          There are tons of problems with the Trump administration, including President Trump's use of the federal government to enrich his own business. But this isn't about any actual misconduct. Democrats arrived for this Congress on Day One promising to impeach Trump. They failed in their first effort when the Mueller report came up empty, and ever since, they have been scrambling for another reason to do what they were going to do anyway. As a result, they find themselves in the role of the kid who had to do his homework assignment on the bus ride to school.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Neal did not specify which areas had been worked out but said the administration and lawmakers’ staff members will work intensely over the two-week congressional break. The goal is that when lawmakers return to Washington they’ll be able to see “the goal line,” Neal said.          Neal also indicated that USTR’s reaction this morning to Democrats’ counteroffer was “favorable.” But he noted that “they still have to digest it.” USTR officials could not be immediately reached for comment.          House Democrats and Lighthizer have been in formal talks since June to strike a deal that would allow for Speaker Nancy Pelosi to put the USMCA up for a vote. Pelosi, for her part, reiterated Thursday that Democrats remained on a “continued path to yes.”          “There is progress being made,” Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), one of the working group members, adding in a baseball reference that he feels negotiations are \"entering the sixth inning.\"          But he said there are still worries — separate from negotiations with the Trump administration — about whether Mexico will follow through on implementing its landmark labor reform law. Lawmakers are concerned that Mexico’s proposed annual budget does not reflect the amount needed for the required changes.          “This has never been viewed as a slam dunk,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), a member of the working group. “But I think what’s important is that if we weren’t [working to get to yes] we wouldn’t be continuing to meet.”          The Trump administration, Republicans and business groups are pushing for USMCA to be put up for a vote in Congress this fall. Democrats have said they hope that they’ll be able to get a deal done this year, even as the House dives into an impeachment inquiry.          Asked if the goal remained to pass USMCA this year, Neal said yes.          “I wouldn’t say we’re on the precipice, but the job is to get to the precipice but not over the edge,” Neal said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In between the insistence on impeachment as a dire national security issue and then the holding of the articles, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave a slight hint into why she’s been going gung-ho for so long, so viciously, yet so utterly devoid and defiant of facts, against President Donald Trump: It’s personal. It’s Pelosi’s way of marking this president for life. “This president is impeached for life regardless of any gamesmanship on the part of Mitch McConnell,” she said on “This Week” on ABC. A few moments later, she added, “There is nothing the Senate can do that can ever erase that.”          What an odd little quip. It’s the type of thing a scorned woman might say of a cheating husband after a nasty divorce that didn’t exactly go her way: “Well, at least his reputation is tainted.” Or: “At least his coworkers know what a piece of [bleep] he is.”          Twitter was quick to pick up on the strangeness, too, trending #ImpeachedForLife shortly after her comments. But Pelosi’s remarks are illuminating because they underscore her personal distaste for Trump the man, as well as Trump the president. They say, ha ha, you may have won with a Republican-dominated Senate, but you haven’t won in the history books. In the end, in Pelosi’s mind, she gets her revenge. But really, that’s hardly a demeanor fitting a speaker. And it’s certainly not an attitude that serves the American people and the Constitution well — or first.

       "151            Nancy Pelosi's wretched, saccharine speech fits her shoddy impeachment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nancy Pelosi began the impeachment debate Wednesday afternoon with a wretchedly written speech proclaiming herself \"solemn\" and \"sad,\" and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.          As unwoke as it is to recite the Pledge (probably racist by the Left's current rules), what's truly shocking is that Pelosi didn't bother to prepare anything substantive or even any compelling rhetoric for her speech. If you literally begin your speech about impeachment by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, it means that you assigned your junior speechwriter to write this speech, probably the night before.          Grave moments call upon leaders to make serious arguments — to make their oratory match the moment. That can be done in many ways. Lincoln did it at Gettysburg with honest gravity and brevity. Reagan did it at the Brandenburg Gate with directness. Churchill, Kennedy, and the other leaders of last century, who faced actually \"solemn\" moments, rose to the occasion by injecting poetry, originality, and eloquence.          Pelosi, in contrast, kicked off her supposedly grave impeachment with a string of half-relevant quotations and piles and piles of melodrama (at one point she uttered the words \"dancing with angels\"). Her party responded with forced applause.          It was a shoddy speech to begin a rushed and shoddy impeachment process.          There are tons of problems with the Trump administration, including President Trump's use of the federal government to enrich his own business. But this isn't about any actual misconduct. Democrats arrived for this Congress on Day One promising to impeach Trump. They failed in their first effort when the Mueller report came up empty, and ever since, they have been scrambling for another reason to do what they were going to do anyway. As a result, they find themselves in the role of the kid who had to do his homework assignment on the bus ride to school.\n",

The goal is that when lawmakers return to Washington they’ll be able to see “the goal line,” Neal said.          Neal also indicated that USTR’s reaction this morning to Democrats’ counteroffer was “favorable.” But he noted that “they still have to digest it.” USTR officials could not be immediately reached for comment.          House Democrats and Lighthizer have been in formal talks since June to strike a deal that would allow for Speaker Nancy Pelosi to put the USMCA up for a vote. Pelosi, for her part, reiterated Thursday that Democrats remained on a “continued path to yes.”          “There is progress being made,” Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), one of the working group members, adding in a baseball reference that he feels negotiations are \"entering the sixth inning.\"          But he said there are still worries — separate from negotiations with the Trump administration — about whether Mexico will follow through on implementing its landmark labor reform law. Lawmakers are concerned that Mexico’s proposed annual budget does not reflect the amount needed for the required changes.          “This has never been viewed as a slam dunk,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), a member of the working group. “But I think what’s important is that if we weren’t [working to get to yes] we wouldn’t be continuing to meet.”          The Trump administration, Republicans and business groups are pushing for USMCA to be put up for a vote in Congress this fall. Democrats have said they hope that they’ll be able to get a deal done this year, even as the House dives into an impeachment inquiry.          Asked if the goal remained to pass USMCA this year, Neal said yes.          “I wouldn’t say we’re on the precipice, but the job is to get to the precipice but not over the edge,” Neal said.\n",

It’s Pelosi’s way of marking this president for life. “This president is impeached for life regardless of any gamesmanship on the part of Mitch McConnell,” she said on “This Week” on ABC. A few moments later, she added, “There is nothing the Senate can do that can ever erase that.”          What an odd little quip. It’s the type of thing a scorned woman might say of a cheating husband after a nasty divorce that didn’t exactly go her way: “Well, at least his reputation is tainted.” Or: “At least his coworkers know what a piece of [bleep] he is.”          Twitter was quick to pick up on the strangeness, too, trending #ImpeachedForLife shortly after her comments. But Pelosi’s remarks are illuminating because they underscore her personal distaste for Trump the man, as well as Trump the president. They say, ha ha, you may have won with a Republican-dominated Senate, but you haven’t won in the history books. In the end, in Pelosi’s mind, she gets her revenge. But really, that’s hardly a demeanor fitting a speaker. And it’s certainly not an attitude that serves the American people and the Constitution well — or first.

       "      <td>President Barack Obama’s chief campaign strategist and senior adviser David Axelrod said that even if President Trump is impeached, it is not likely he will be convicted by the Senate and removed from office.          Appearing on CNN Tuesday evening after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry, Axelrod, 64, tossed water on some lawmakers’ hopes that impeachment would successfully remove Trump from the White House.          “This is a moment of extraordinary historical import,” Axelrod noted. “Only three presidents in history who were impeached. But it’s also true that no president in history has ever been convicted and removed from office and it is very, very unlikely that that’s going to happen here.\"          He pointed out that a large number of Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate would have to vote with the Democrats in order to form the 67 votes needed to oust the president.          “We should be sober about it. But we also kind of know how this story is going to end,” Axelrod said. “Donald Trump is not going to be removed from office, but this is overhang that he will have to deal with over the next many months as he is seeking reelection.”          Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were the only presidents to have been impeached by the House of Representatives, though neither were convicted.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Honor a congressional subpoena to appear at President Trump’s (presumably eventual) Senate impeachment trial? Joe Biden, still the odds-on favorite to be the Democrats’ standard-bearer in the 2020 election, scoffed at the very idea: No way! The former vice president’s knee-jerk obstinacy illuminates — we should say, provides even more illumination of — the patent farce that is the second article of impeachment passed by the House on a strict party-line vote: the accusation that the president has obstructed Congress. As we saw in a committee hearing, featuring the spectacle of staffers questioning staffers with no actual fact witnesses in sight, Democrats have no problem when Democrats blow off congressional demands for information. “Obstruction” is a one-way street. Trump regards the impeachment inquiry as a partisan witch hunt, just the latest phase of the Democrats’ project to remove him, which began even before his term started. He certainly has a point, although that is not a good reason to give his opponents fuel for the project, as he did by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden. That is the allegation in the first article of impeachment. Under the circumstances, I believe it falls well short of the egregious misconduct for which impeachment should be reserved; it was, nevertheless, a foolish thing for the president to do. Let’s focus, though, on the second impeachment article, obstruction of Congress. To be clear, Congress has undeniable constitutional authority, broad in scope, to conduct oversight of the executive branch. The president, with all the authority of a peer branch of government, has extensive privileges of confidentiality, rooted in Article II, particularly when it comes to communications with his staff and high executive officials. Congress, however, is empowered to probe, especially when its concern is presidential malfeasance, or the activities of executive branch agencies Congress has created — such agencies, after all, are led by officers subject to Senate confirmation, and Congress both underwrites them with taxpayer funds and limits their operations by statute.</td>\n",

       "      <td>GOP congressman blasts Trump for quoting evangelical pastor's ‘civil war’ threat: ‘This is beyond repugnant’</td>\n",
       "      <td>Appearing on Fox News on Sunday, Robert Jeffress — one of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical sycophants — asserted that Trump’s impeachment could cause “a Civil War-like fracture” in the United States. Trump repeated Jeffress’ assertion on Twitter — and got an angry response from a fellow Republican: Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.          Jeffress, pastor at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, is a prominent figure on the Christian Right. And during his Sunday appearance on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends,” Jeffress insisted to co-hosts Pete Hegseth and Jedediah Bila that Trump has done nothing to deserve impeachment and attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for supporting an impeachment inquiry — stressing, “I do want to make this prediction this morning: if the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, I’m afraid it will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal.”          On Twitter, Trump quoted Jeffress and zeroed right in on the Civil War part:          Upon seeing Trump’s post, Kinzinger angrily tweeted in response, “I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.”          A 41-year-old military veteran who served in the U.S. Air Force during the Iraq War, Kinzinger was first elected to the House as a Republican in 2010.          Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives because of a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript/summary of that conversation shows that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into digging up dirt on a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden — which Pelosi, formerly the Democratic Party’s most prominent opponent of impeaching Trump, considers an impeachable offense.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trump impeachment inquiry sparked by effort to uncover ‘witch hunt’ origins</td>\n",
       "      <td>At the heart of the infamous Ukraine phone call that prompted House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is President Trump’s vow to get to the bottom of the origins of the Russia probe, which dominated the first two-plus years of his presidency.          In trying to uncover how the “witch hunt” began, Mr. Trump now faces a bigger political crisis.          The Trump campaign came out swinging this weekend against impeachment, launching a $10 million TV and digital ad accusing Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden of meddling in Ukraine. Political insiders say it’s a strong indication of how Mr. Trump intends to fight back.          “He’ll be very aggressive,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. “I think ultimately his game plan is to make sure the base is with him. He understands this is a political fight, not a legal fight, and he’s going to play politics. He knows that if he loses the base, he loses the game.”          Mr. Trump and his aides in the early days of the crisis have gone on the attack against an unnamed government whistleblower who prompted the charges while also firing back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Chairman Adam B. Schiff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The White House message is that this latest political peril for Mr. Trump is all part of the same partisan hatred that has dogged him from the start.          “There are no high crimes and misdemeanors here,” said White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. “People were talking about impeaching this president before he even got inaugurated. And now they’re getting their wish. Nancy Pelosi finally capitulated to her angry mob.”          She said the American people “will see what’s not getting done” in Congress while Democrats devote their attention to impeaching Mr. Trump in a strong economy.          The president also echoed a prediction Sunday by Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel that the Democrats’ impeachment effort will backfire, especially in Democratic House districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016.          “Will happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in 50 Trump type Districts,” the president tweeted. “We will win big!”          In trying to sustain his 2020 reelection bid, Mr. Trump is still fighting a battle over his 2016 campaign.          The president’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 started with pleasantries, but quickly shifted Mr. Trump’s interest in a missing Democratic National Committee server that was hacked by Russia during the 2016 election.          “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine … The server, they say Ukraine has it,” the president told Mr. Zelensky.          He also mentioned the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which the DNC hired in 2016 to investigate the breach of its servers and first reported Russia as the culprit.          The president’s conversation took place a day after special counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress, an appearance that was criticized as weak. Mr. Mueller did confirm the findings of his report, which found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the election.          “As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance,” Mr. Trump told Ukraine’s leader. “But they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”          The Justice Department has announced that U.S. attorney John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane” probe into alleged links between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia, was already looking into whether the Ukrainian government led by then-President Petro Poroshenko was involved in the effort to torpedo Mr. Trump’s candidacy.          Mr. Zelensky raised the name of the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani had canceled a trip to Ukraine last spring to investigate whether the previous Ukrainian administration helped Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign by providing information concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s lobbying work in the country.          Mr. Giuliani also was probing why Ukraine fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who had been looking into Hunter Biden’s lucrative position with a Ukrainian energy company.          “This is what they [Democrats] did to Manafort,” said veteran Washington lawyer John Down, who represented the president in the Mueller probe. “They went overseas and they dug all this stuff up. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”          The Hill reported in May that the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington said a Democratic National Committee contractor solicited dirt on Manafort during the 2016 campaign and even tried to enlist the country’s president to help.          The contractor later tried to arrange for Mr. Poroshenko to comment on Manafort’s Russian ties during a visit to the U.S. during the 2016 campaign, the Ukrainian ambassador said.          As for Mr. Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, the president’s conservative allies also believe there is a potential connection to the origins of the Russia allegations against Mr. Trump.          “Biden was responsible for U.S. policy in Ukraine during the Obama administration, and much of the false narrative about President Donald Trump being a Russian agent came from Ukraine, the United Kingdom and other Western intelligence agencies, which his administration put a bow on and shipped to the FISA court so they could spy on the Trump campaign in 2016,” said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government. “What did Joe Biden know about Russiagate and when did he know it?”          The president also has directed most of his campaign criticism at Mr. Biden, perceiving him as his likeliest — and probably toughest — opponent in the general election. He’s gone to considerable lengths to take him out early during the Democratic primary, openly questioning his fitness for office.          “I think he’s the weakest mentally, and I like running against people that are weak mentally,” the president said of Mr. Biden last summer.          Democrats are using the president’s effort to investigate the Bidens in Ukraine as their primary argument for impeachment, accusing the president of seeking foreign help in interfering in a U.S. election. Mr. Biden is, for now, still the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.          At the time of the phone call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine.          “I think we have to stay focused as far as the public is concerned on the fact that the president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday.          Mrs. Pelosi also suggested that Russia played a role in the saga.          “It is wrong for any foreign government to interfere in our elections and here you have the president of the United States asking for that,” she said without elaborating. “I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way.”          The White House ended the week with Mr. Trump declaring “we’re at war” with the Democrats. The president and his allies were also questioning the motives of the unnamed government whistleblower, who’s reportedly a CIA officer.          Mr. Trump last week also suggested he could go to court to stop the Democrats.          “There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts,” Mr. Trump said.          Even some Republicans close to the White House say impeachment is a real concern.          “I think there’s a good chance of impeachment,” said one administration ally. “Will he be removed [by the Senate]? No. Will he even care? I think he thinks it would be one more big reality TV moment, and he’s the star of it.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Rep. Andy Biggs: Democrats' latest attempt to take down Trump will fail, just as their other ones have</td>\n",
       "      <td>We've grown used to radical Leftists, in Congress and the media, having their soup de jour, the accusation of the day. But this latest one has actually prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry. What is the accusation? President Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president to congratulate him on his election and discussed several things, including the investigation of alleged illegal conduct on the part of the son of a prominent American politician. This is just another fail. Within the past few weeks, the Left has floated impeaching Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, criticized Vice President Mike Pence for an extended stay during a visit to his foreign, historical family home, melted down over the President’s invitation of national leaders of the G7 to one of his properties, and most ludicrously, blasted him for allegedly stealing pancakes. HANS VON SPAKOVSKY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT EFFORT WILL BE HISTORIC POLITICAL BATTLE – HERE'S HOW THE PROCESS WORKS          The media wonders why its credibility is in the dumpster. The Left wonders why the President has the approval of most Americans, higher than former President Barack Obama at the same juncture of his term. The standard bearer of the latest effort to impeach President Trump is Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of the House intelligence Committee. You will remember him for his zealous advocacy for reliance on the Mueller Report. Schiff promised that evidence of Russian collusion was real, present, and would be confirmed in the Mueller Report. Oops. The Mueller investigation did not support Schiff’s promised conclusion. In fact, it found that there was no collusion, cooperation or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. So here we are again. The Democrats desire to get the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This seems wholly unwarranted based on the allegations of an unknown person, who probably did not even hear the conversation. This individual apparently heard about the conversation from someone else. Such testimony would never be allowed in court because it is inherently unreliable. And, it reveals something about the way things work in the White House. It seems that the President has no private conversations with leaders of foreign countries. I suspect that the leaders of other nations understand that those conversations are scrutinized by the U.S. intelligence apparatus. But I also believe that foreign leaders do not anticipate that Americans are so cavalier as to transcribe these conversations and then pass them on to Congress, which seems to have the loosest of lips. In fact, foreign leaders probably do not realize there is a threat that their conversations could be leaked, if given to Schiff, a person that former Congressman Trey Gowdy has described as leakier than a screen-door on a submarine. What do the Ukrainian leaders have to say about the content of the conversation? Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko says there were no threats. There was nothing untoward or out of the ordinary in the conversation. Joe Biden once bragged that he had been in Ukraine and demanded that its leaders fire a prosecutor who was investigating allegations of wrongdoing of an international energy company, or else. Oh, by the way, Biden’s son, Hunter, sat on the board of directors of that company. Was it out of line to inquire of an American who was under investigation by the Ukrainians? They projected a false narrative for years, creating a division in our nation that may not heal for a generation, that the Trump administration is illegitimate because of Russian “collusion” in the 2016 election. But, it turns out, that Ukrainians donated tens of millions of dollars to the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee. In fact, the Ukraine government voted to investigate that. Prediction: the Left will persist in its quixotic quest to remove President Donald Trump. And, when the Ukraine telephone gambit fades, look for the next stolen pancake allegation to consume our misguided friends.</td>\n",

strategist and senior adviser David Axelrod said that even if President Trump is impeached, it is not likely he will be convicted by the Senate and removed from office.          Appearing on CNN Tuesday evening after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry, Axelrod, 64, tossed water on some lawmakers’ hopes that impeachment would successfully remove Trump from the White House.          “This is a moment of extraordinary historical import,” Axelrod noted. “Only three presidents in history who were impeached. But it’s also true that no president in history has ever been convicted and removed from office and it is very, very unlikely that that’s going to happen here.\"          He pointed out that a large number of Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate would have to vote with the Democrats in order to form the 67 votes needed to oust the president.          “We should be sober about it. But we also kind of know how this story is going to end,” Axelrod said. “Donald Trump is not going to be removed from office, but this is overhang that he will have to deal with over the next many months as he is seeking reelection.”          Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were the only presidents to have been impeached by the House of Representatives, though neither were convicted.\n",

Honor a congressional subpoena to appear at President Trump’s (presumably eventual) Senate impeachment trial? Joe Biden, still the odds-on favorite to be the Democrats’ standard-bearer in the 2020 election, scoffed at the very idea: No way! The former vice president’s knee-jerk obstinacy illuminates — we should say, provides even more illumination of — the patent farce that is the second article of impeachment passed by the House on a strict party-line vote: the accusation that the president has obstructed Congress. As we saw in a committee hearing, featuring the spectacle of staffers questioning staffers with no actual fact witnesses in sight, Democrats have no problem when Democrats blow off congressional demands for information. “Obstruction” is a one-way street. Trump regards the impeachment inquiry as a partisan witch hunt, just the latest phase of the Democrats’ project to remove him, which began even before his term started. He certainly has a point, although that is not a good reason to give his opponents fuel for the project, as he did by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden. That is the allegation in the first article of impeachment. Under the circumstances, I believe it falls well short of the egregious misconduct for which impeachment should be reserved; it was, nevertheless, a foolish thing for the president to do. Let’s focus, though, on the second impeachment article, obstruction of Congress. To be clear, Congress has undeniable constitutional authority, broad in scope, to conduct oversight of the executive branch. The president, with all the authority of a peer branch of government, has extensive privileges of confidentiality, rooted in Article II, particularly when it comes to communications with his staff and high executive officials. Congress, however, is empowered to probe, especially when its concern is presidential malfeasance, or the activities of executive branch agencies Congress has created — such agencies, after all, are led by officers subject to Senate confirmation, and Congress both underwrites them with taxpayer funds and limits their operations by statute.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Appearing on Fox News on Sunday, Robert Jeffress — one of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical sycophants — asserted that Trump’s impeachment could cause “a Civil War-like fracture” in the United States. Trump repeated Jeffress’ assertion on Twitter — and got an angry response from a fellow Republican: Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.          Jeffress, pastor at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, is a prominent figure on the Christian Right. And during his Sunday appearance on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends,” Jeffress insisted to co-hosts Pete Hegseth and Jedediah Bila that Trump has done nothing to deserve impeachment and attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for supporting an impeachment inquiry — stressing, “I do want to make this prediction this morning: if the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, I’m afraid it will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal.”          On Twitter, Trump quoted Jeffress and zeroed right in on the Civil War part:          Upon seeing Trump’s post, Kinzinger angrily tweeted in response, “I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.”          A 41-year-old military veteran who served in the U.S. Air Force during the Iraq War, Kinzinger was first elected to the House as a Republican in 2010.          Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives because of a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript/summary of that conversation shows that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into digging up dirt on a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden — which Pelosi, formerly the Democratic Party’s most prominent opponent of impeaching Trump, considers an impeachable offense.\n",
       "223                                   Trump impeachment inquiry sparked by effort to uncover ‘witch hunt’ origins  At the heart of the infamous Ukraine phone call that prompted House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is President Trump’s vow to get to the bottom of the origins of the Russia probe, which dominated the first two-plus years of his presidency.          In trying to uncover how the “witch hunt” began, Mr. Trump now faces a bigger political crisis.          The Trump campaign came out swinging this weekend against impeachment, launching a $10 million TV and digital ad accusing Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden of meddling in Ukraine. Political insiders say it’s a strong indication of how Mr. Trump intends to fight back.          “He’ll be very aggressive,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. “I think ultimately his game plan is to make sure the base is with him. He understands this is a political fight, not a legal fight, and he’s going to play politics. He knows that if he loses the base, he loses the game.”          Mr. Trump and his aides in the early days of the crisis have gone on the attack against an unnamed government whistleblower who prompted the charges while also firing back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Chairman Adam B. Schiff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The White House message is that this latest political peril for Mr. Trump is all part of the same partisan hatred that has dogged him from the start.          “There are no high crimes and misdemeanors here,” said White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. “People were talking about impeaching this president before he even got inaugurated. And now they’re getting their wish. Nancy Pelosi finally capitulated to her angry mob.”          She said the American people “will see what’s not getting done” in Congress while Democrats devote their attention to impeaching Mr. Trump in a strong economy.          The president also echoed a prediction Sunday by Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel that the Democrats’ impeachment effort will backfire, especially in Democratic House districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016.          “Will happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in 50 Trump type Districts,” the president tweeted. “We will win big!”          In trying to sustain his 2020 reelection bid, Mr. Trump is still fighting a battle over his 2016 campaign.          The president’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 started with pleasantries, but quickly shifted Mr. Trump’s interest in a missing Democratic National Committee server that was hacked by Russia during the 2016 election.          “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine … The server, they say Ukraine has it,” the president told Mr. Zelensky.          He also mentioned the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which the DNC hired in 2016 to investigate the breach of its servers and first reported Russia as the culprit.          The president’s conversation took place a day after special counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress, an appearance that was criticized as weak. Mr. Mueller did confirm the findings of his report, which found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the election.          “As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance,” Mr. Trump told Ukraine’s leader. “But they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”          The Justice Department has announced that U.S. attorney John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane” probe into alleged links between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia, was already looking into whether the Ukrainian government led by then-President Petro Poroshenko was involved in the effort to torpedo Mr. Trump’s candidacy.          Mr. Zelensky raised the name of the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani had canceled a trip to Ukraine last spring to investigate whether the previous Ukrainian administration helped Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign by providing information concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s lobbying work in the country.          Mr. Giuliani also was probing why Ukraine fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who had been looking into Hunter Biden’s lucrative position with a Ukrainian energy company.          “This is what they [Democrats] did to Manafort,” said veteran Washington lawyer John Down, who represented the president in the Mueller probe. “They went overseas and they dug all this stuff up. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”          The Hill reported in May that the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington said a Democratic National Committee contractor solicited dirt on Manafort during the 2016 campaign and even tried to enlist the country’s president to help.          The contractor later tried to arrange for Mr. Poroshenko to comment on Manafort’s Russian ties during a visit to the U.S. during the 2016 campaign, the Ukrainian ambassador said.          As for Mr. Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, the president’s conservative allies also believe there is a potential connection to the origins of the Russia allegations against Mr. Trump.          “Biden was responsible for U.S. policy in Ukraine during the Obama administration, and much of the false narrative about President Donald Trump being a Russian agent came from Ukraine, the United Kingdom and other Western intelligence agencies, which his administration put a bow on and shipped to the FISA court so they could spy on the Trump campaign in 2016,” said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government. “What did Joe Biden know about Russiagate and when did he know it?”          The president also has directed most of his campaign criticism at Mr. Biden, perceiving him as his likeliest — and probably toughest — opponent in the general election. He’s gone to considerable lengths to take him out early during the Democratic primary, openly questioning his fitness for office.          “I think he’s the weakest mentally, and I like running against people that are weak mentally,” the president said of Mr. Biden last summer.          Democrats are using the president’s effort to investigate the Bidens in Ukraine as their primary argument for impeachment, accusing the president of seeking foreign help in interfering in a U.S. election. Mr. Biden is, for now, still the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.          At the time of the phone call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine.          “I think we have to stay focused as far as the public is concerned on the fact that the president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday.          Mrs. Pelosi also suggested that Russia played a role in the saga.          “It is wrong for any foreign government to interfere in our elections and here you have the president of the United States asking for that,” she said without elaborating. “I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way.”          The White House ended the week with Mr. Trump declaring “we’re at war” with the Democrats. The president and his allies were also questioning the motives of the unnamed government whistleblower, who’s reportedly a CIA officer.          Mr. Trump last week also suggested he could go to court to stop the Democrats.          “There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts,” Mr. Trump said.          Even some Republicans close to the White House say impeachment is a real concern.          “I think there’s a good chance of impeachment,” said one administration ally. “Will he be removed [by the Senate]? No. Will he even care? I think he thinks it would be one more big reality TV moment, and he’s the star of it.”\n",
       "240        Rep. Andy Biggs: Democrats' latest attempt to take down Trump will fail, just as their other ones have                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 We've grown used to radical Leftists, in Congress and the media, having their soup de jour, the accusation of the day. But this latest one has actually prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry. What is the accusation? President Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president to congratulate him on his election and discussed several things, including the investigation of alleged illegal conduct on the part of the son of a prominent American politician. This is just another fail. Within the past few weeks, the Left has floated impeaching Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, criticized Vice President Mike Pence for an extended stay during a visit to his foreign, historical family home, melted down over the President’s invitation of national leaders of the G7 to one of his properties, and most ludicrously, blasted him for allegedly stealing pancakes. HANS VON SPAKOVSKY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT EFFORT WILL BE HISTORIC POLITICAL BATTLE – HERE'S HOW THE PROCESS WORKS          The media wonders why its credibility is in the dumpster. The Left wonders why the President has the approval of most Americans, higher than former President Barack Obama at the same juncture of his term. The standard bearer of the latest effort to impeach President Trump is Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of the House intelligence Committee. You will remember him for his zealous advocacy for reliance on the Mueller Report. Schiff promised that evidence of Russian collusion was real, present, and would be confirmed in the Mueller Report. Oops. The Mueller investigation did not support Schiff’s promised conclusion. In fact, it found that there was no collusion, cooperation or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. So here we are again. The Democrats desire to get the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This seems wholly unwarranted based on the allegations of an unknown person, who probably did not even hear the conversation. This individual apparently heard about the conversation from someone else. Such testimony would never be allowed in court because it is inherently unreliable. And, it reveals something about the way things work in the White House. It seems that the President has no private conversations with leaders of foreign countries. I suspect that the leaders of other nations understand that those conversations are scrutinized by the U.S. intelligence apparatus. But I also believe that foreign leaders do not anticipate that Americans are so cavalier as to transcribe these conversations and then pass them on to Congress, which seems to have the loosest of lips. In fact, foreign leaders probably do not realize there is a threat that their conversations could be leaked, if given to Schiff, a person that former Congressman Trey Gowdy has described as leakier than a screen-door on a submarine. What do the Ukrainian leaders have to say about the content of the conversation? Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko says there were no threats. There was nothing untoward or out of the ordinary in the conversation. Joe Biden once bragged that he had been in Ukraine and demanded that its leaders fire a prosecutor who was investigating allegations of wrongdoing of an international energy company, or else. Oh, by the way, Biden’s son, Hunter, sat on the board of directors of that company. Was it out of line to inquire of an American who was under investigation by the Ukrainians? They projected a false narrative for years, creating a division in our nation that may not heal for a generation, that the Trump administration is illegitimate because of Russian “collusion” in the 2016 election. But, it turns out, that Ukrainians donated tens of millions of dollars to the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee. In fact, the Ukraine government voted to investigate that. Prediction: the Left will persist in its quixotic quest to remove President Donald Trump. And, when the Ukraine telephone gambit fades, look for the next stolen pancake allegation to consume our misguided friends."

       "      <td>Opinion | Why the Democratic Establishment Still Has Juice</td>\n",
       "      <td>One reason it was so widely assumed Sanders would take a significant delegate lead on Super Tuesday was that we had a direct analogue — Republicans nominated Donald Trump in 2016 when he jumped out to a lead by winning plurality victories against a fractured field. If Republicans couldn’t unite to blunt Trump, why would Democrats fare any better against Sanders?          That the Democrats managed it speaks to the different mood and dynamic of the party compared with the GOP in 2016.          Four years ago, Republicans loathed their party establishment and had turned their backs on their immediate past president, George W. Bush, who left office saddled with an unpopular war and a devastating financial crisis. Sanders wants to foment a revolution against the Democratic establishment. This resonates with his supporters but isn’t a widespread sentiment within the party.          As Peter Beinart points out in The Atlantic, Bush and his signature initiative, the Iraq War, weren’t popular with Republicans, whereas Barack Obama and his signature initiative, Obamacare, are popular with Democrats.          This made it possible for Biden to run on restoration rather than revolution and find an audience, especially in South Carolina, where many voters told exit pollsters they wanted a return to Obama policies.          It also meant that, as a general matter, pillars of the party establishment hadn’t been discredited. The biggest moment for Biden over the past two weeks was the endorsement of a 14-term congressman and member of congressional leadership who has the credibility to move votes in South Carolina. A jaw-dropping 61 percent of voters said Clyburn’s endorsement was important in their decision.          After Biden’s smashing victory in South Carolina, the party fell in line amazingly quickly. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar got out and endorsed Biden, and former candidate Beto O’Rourke did the same. Buttigieg endorsed after reportedly talking to Obama. It was a collective action of the sort that Republicans couldn’t manage in 2016.          This was in part because there was no one suitable to rally around. Jeb Bush’s association with the two past presidents of his party was a liability because it played into the charge of dynasty and any establishment mobilization on his behalf would have looked untoward. Besides, Jeb Bush had the poor early showings of Biden without the reservoir of support among a key base of voters, like Biden’s strength among African Americans.          It was Ted Cruz who was the only viable alternative to Trump. But no one wanted to come to his aid. He wasn’t a longtime party fixture considered fondly even by his competitors, but an ambitious newcomer who had alienated his colleagues and frightened the establishment. Nor was anyone prepared to defer to him as an elder statesman who had earned “his turn.”          On top of this, Trump scrambled ideological categories with his heterodox candidacy and even piqued the curiosity of elements of the GOP old guard. Sanders, in contrast, catalyzed a straight left vs. moderate fight and occasioned the uniform fear and loathing of the Democratic establishment.          Finally, Republicans wanted to throw caution to the wind. The last two candidates identified with the establishment, John McCain and Mitt Romney, had lost, and the Republican victories in the midterm elections in 2010 and 2014 had delivered less than the party’s base had expected. It was a time for risks and for strong medicine — because, really, how could things get worse?          The mood of a swath of the Democratic Party is the opposite — extreme nervousness about messing up its opportunity to defeat Trump, leading to a cautious, practical-minded focus on electability.          What will be the upshot of the party’s effort to stall Sanders? That we don’t know. Party establishments can fail two ways. They can be ineffectual and they can be wrong. Republicans failed to stop Trump in 2016, at the same time that fears he couldn’t win the election proved unfounded. Meanwhile, Democrats tilted the playing field toward Hillary Clinton and succeeded only in elevating a historically weak candidate particularly ill-suited to running against Trump.          This year, the Democratic establishment may yet again, in much more dire circumstances (Sanders never looked like he was really going to defeat Clintonin 2016), thwart Sanders. Yet the party is throwing itself into the arms of a septuagenarian with serious performance issues for lack of a better alternative. We won’t know if this is a smashing success or grievous mistake, born of desperation, until November.</td>\n",

       "      <td>LAS VEGAS -- Sen. Bernie Sanders cruised to victory in the Nevada caucuses, heartening his supporters and stoking alarm among moderates who fear he is too liberal and would lose to President Donald Trump.          Sanders' convincing win means there is no longer an asterisk next to his status as the front-runner in the race. He proved his strength with a broad coalition that included Latino voters, union members and African Americans.          Now Sanders claims three victories in a row heading into South Carolina next Saturday, and more important, Super Tuesday on March 3 when about one-third of the delegates needed for the nomination are at stake. The biggest prizes that day, California and Texas, look a lot like Nevada demographically.          Another advantage: His opponents remain splintered and, with the exception of billionaire former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, under-funded to compete across such a vast terrain.          But now there will be extraordinary pressure to try to consolidate moderate support in an effort to stop Sanders' rise. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren will have a decision to make on how much she tries to draw separation from Sanders since they are both competing for the progressive vote.          There is at least one strong note of caution about Sanders' success. In Iowa and New Hampshire he didn't seem to grow the electorate substantially. Data is still out in Nevada.          Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg ran well behind Sanders, but he tried to cast himself as the strongest alternative to Sanders.          In language uncharacteristically blunt, Buttigieg issued a warning to Democrats about the perils of nominating Sanders, whom he characterized as inflexible and whose ideas are not in the American mainstream.          “Sen. Sanders believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans,” Buttigieg told supporters. He held himself out as the only viable alternative. “We can prioritize either ideological purity or inclusive victory,” Buttigieg said.          He added: “Sen. Sanders sees capitalism as the root of all evil. He’d go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support.”          Despite his forceful argument, there’s a serious risk to Buttigieg in the upcoming calendar. He will have to win over black voters in South Carolina, then pivot to a multistate primary with comparatively limited resources. Buttigieg put out a plea for $13 million from donors before Super Tuesday.          The former mayor of a city of 100,000 has repeatedly defied the odds in the presidential nominating contests, but the odds are getting longer.          BIDEN HAS HIS BACK AGAINST A FIREWALL          Former Vice President Joe Biden was hoping Nevada would turn things around for him after a disastrous showing in Iowa and then New Hampshire. He argued that he'd do better in a more diverse state.          But Biden again lost badly even as he told supporters at a union hall, “We’re alive and coming back and we’re gonna win.”          His last and best hope may be to win in South Carolina next Saturday. He’s counting on his support among the state’s black voters — they could make up two-thirds of the voters — to serve as his firewall.          If Biden doesn't win South Carolina, the rationale for his candidacy will much harder to maintain.          In Las Vegas, he tried out a new rallying cry: \"I ain't a socialist. I ain't a plutocrat. I'm a Democrat. And I'm proud of it.\" Party loyalty may be all Biden has left.          MAYBE CULINARY ISN'T ALL-POWERFUL AFTER ALL          The 60,000-member Culinary Workers Local 226 represents workers in the casinos on the Las Vegas strip, and it’s routinely described, correctly, as the most powerful force in the state’s Democratic politics. But it’s not omnipotent.          Culinary didn’t want Sanders to win. It has strongly opposed his “Medicare for All” plan, warning its members that it would eliminate their own generous health plan. Some observers thought the union might end up backing Biden. But after the former vice president’s embarrassing performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, Culinary instead stayed neutral.          The calls from leadership went unheeded by many. Sanders had strong showings in some caucuses in casinos where crowds of Culinary members chanted the Vermont senator’s name and powered him to wins in most casinos. Culinary is driven by its members, many of whom are Sanders supporters, and there was no consensus among the rest about what they should do.          Leadership decided to refrain from a divisive fight, helping pave the way for Sanders’ win. It’s a reminder that even in places like Nevada with strong political institutions, those institutions ultimately derive their power from voters.          Sen. Amy Klobuchar produced one of the few surprises of the race when she surged to a third-place finish in New Hampshire, announced that she had raised more than $12 million, and vowed to prove her doubters wrong.          Her momentum proved short-lived. She finished well behind the leading candidates, and in the process, prompted questions about her viability.          But in a speech to supporters in her home state of Minnesota, she was defiant and said she would continue. She even tried to make a virtue of the fact that Trump mentioned her name at a rally. “By the way, for the first time ever, he mentioned me at a rally,” she said. “You know I’ve arrived now. You know they must be worried.”          Probably not. Time is running out for candidates who haven't finished higher than third in any contest. That also applies to Warren, also desperately needs a win. Her strong debate performance came after much of the state had already cast early votes.          Tom Steyer, the billionaire who made his fortune running a hedge fund, bet heavily in Nevada, more than $12 million on advertising, and lost big, finishing sixth. Steyer has made strong appeals to minority voters, but in Nevada, failed decisively.          But Steyer's impact on the race could come next week in South Carolina, where he has spent even more money. Polls show that he has made significant inroads among African American voters. That would not be good news for Biden, who is counting on those votes to resuscitate his campaign.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Charles Payne: Markets breathing 'giant sigh of relief' after Dem voters rejected Sanders' socialism</td>\n",
       "      <td>medianame Business Network host Charles Payne said Wednesday that the stock market was breathing a \"giant sigh of relief that socialism lost last night and that we will not get rid of our entire health care system.”          Payne made the comments on “America’s Newsroom” the day after former Vice President Joe Biden’s strong showing on Super Tuesday lifted health care stocks. With votes still being counted, Biden had secured about 453 delegates on Super Tuesday, according to the Associated Press, capping a dramatic comeback after his campaign was left for dead following the Nevada caucus on Feb. 22. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the self-declared democratic socialist and perceived frontrunner ahead of Tuesday night, had secured 382 delegates. Health care stocks, led by the insurers, soared in response to Biden’s big night. The names had been badly beaten down, underperforming the S&amp;P 500, as Sanders, who is an advocate of Medicare-for-all, climbed in the polls. On Wednesday, Payne said Sanders’ “overwhelming victory in Nevada” and coronavirus fears “both had an effect” on the market. BIDEN SURGES TO VICTORY ACROSS SUPER TUESDAY MAP, AS SANDERS CLAIMS DELEGATE PRIZE IN CALIFORNIA          He then noted that on Wednesday health care stocks surged “a lot more than the overall market.”          “Health care is up 4.4 percent. S&amp;P is up 2.2 percent. It’s up 100 percent more than the rest of the market,” Payne pointed out. “There is a giant sigh of relief that socialism lost last night and that we will not get rid of our entire health care system. There’s a giant sigh of relief on Main Street and some of that is reflected on Wall Street.”          Payne cautioned that the markets overall are still jittery amid the coronavirus outbreak. \"Utility stocks, consumer staples and real estate, those are all considered cautionary places that you put your money when you’re worried, so this is not a runaway market, but it is a sigh of relief.”          Payne went on to say that he thinks that “as we get closer to the actual election, the markets will start to get a little anxious about Biden,\" though not on the same level as the prospect of Sanders winning the nomination.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It’s the day when the greatest number of US states cast their votes to nominate presidential candidates, who will eventually compete for the White House in November’s general election.          It is the biggest day in the US election calendar apart from election day itself. The candidates have each held hundreds of meet-and-greet events, travelled thousands of miles, eaten a lot of junk food, and their campaigns have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to get them to this make-or-break moment.          In 2020, Super Tuesday falls on 3 March. Both Democrats and Republicans will be voting, but because Donald Trump does not face any serious challengers, all eyes will be on the Democratic contest.          The early voting states – Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina – have all had their say over the past month, with Bernie Sanders emerging as the possible national frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination.          But now, 14 states across the country – Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia – as well as one US territory (American Samoa) and Democrats abroad will cast their votes on the same day.          Who are the Democratic presidential candidates?          There are eight leading Democratic presidential candidates competing: former vice-president Joe Biden, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, former mayors Mike Bloomberg and Pete Buttigieg, billionaire philanthropist Tom Steyer and Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.          Sanders and Warren are on the progressive side of the party, while candidates such as Biden, Klobuchar, Bloomberg and Buttigieg are regarded as more moderate.          This will be the first time that Bloomberg will be on the ballot, and will be a key test of whether the hundreds of millions of dollars he has invested in his own campaign have paid off. He controversially skipped the first early voting states to concentrate on winning support in larger, delegate heavy states.          The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and US territories, by which the party selects its presidential nominee.          The goal for the candidates is to amass a majority of pledged delegates whose job it is to nominate the candidate at the party’s convention. In all states, delegates are awarded proportionally among top winners.          To become the Democratic presidential nominee, the candidate must secure 1,991 pledged delegates from a total of 4,750.          So far, less than 5% of delegates have been allotted, but on Super Tuesday, more than a third of available delegates are up for grabs – giving it the potential to propel one candidate to frontrunner status, and prompt others who perform badly to quit the race.          California has the most pledged delegates (494) followed by Texas (261), North Carolina (72) and Virginia (65).          The Super Tuesday states also represent a much broader sweep of the US population, not just in terms of geography, but demographics too, than the early voting states. The results will therefore give a more detailed picture of who supports the candidates, and what their chances of winning on a national level may be.          Do all the states vote at the same time?          Polling times vary state by state. Vermont’s polls close first at 7pm ET and California’s close last at 11pm ET.          More than a week ahead of Super Tuesday, almost 2m ballots had already been cast as several states allow early voting.          What time will the results be announced?          Results will begin to be reported after the first polls close at 7pm ET. medianame will be reporting the results live, as they come in.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For much of the Democratic nomination battle, it’s been assumed that Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are dividing the far-left vote and making it more likely that Joe Biden will win. In reality, the most realistic path that progressives have for denying Biden the nomination likely involves both Warren and Sanders remaining in the race until the bitter end.          On the surface, the argument for why liberals would be better off with either Warren or Sanders in the race rather than both is straightforward. Add their support together in national and early state polls, and they easily surpass Biden. In the run-up to Iowa, the clash between Warren and Sanders would seemingly be an acknowledgment that for one of them to win, they have to take out the other to consolidate the anti-Biden vote.          Even if it were plausibly true that had, say, Sanders decided to stay out of the race and endorse Warren from the get-go, that there would be higher odds of a liberal candidate defeating Biden, that ship has long since sailed. Both candidates will be in the race at least until Iowa. So the question at this point is whether the Left is better off with one of them dropping out early, or with both of them trying to stay in for the long haul.          Biden remains in a position to finish at or near the top in Iowa and New Hampshire, and if he’s able to survive those contests, he has a much better chance of amassing delegates as the race moves to South Carolina and other states with a large percentage of black voters. Thus, if Warren and Sanders fail to bury him in Iowa and New Hampshire, the best shot at stopping Biden may be on the convention floor. The possibility of a contested convention is more likely in 2020 than in most years as a result of the way that Democrats allocate delegates, as well as the size of the field.          Under a rules change, superdelegates who are allowed to vote for any candidate they want are barred from casting a decisive vote on the first ballot. That is, if Biden does not win a majority of delegates outright, then he’ll have to win the nomination when Democrats gather in Milwaukee in July. If both Sanders and Warren can remain viable, it increases the odds that they will be able to deny Biden an outright majority.          Though there may be some degree of overlap between Warren and Sanders voters, their supporters are not interchangeable. Some Warren voters may prefer her policy proposals or simply want somebody younger or female. Sanders voters may view him as more authentically dedicated to the “revolution” or may have bought into the argument that it would be harder for a woman to beat President Trump. A recent Morning Consult found that nearly as many Sanders supporters chose Biden as their second choice (27%) as Warren (30%). Warren supporters were more likely to gravitate to Sanders as their second choice, but still, only 37% of her supporters chose him as the next best option. There is also a “Bernie or bust” crowd that would not vote if he were not on the ballot.          Were Sanders and Warren to both remain in the race through the primaries, they would be able to capture more voters collectively than they would otherwise be able to were only one of them to survive. Biden’s share of the vote will be further carved up if additional candidates, such as Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, do well enough in the early states to stay in or if Michael Bloomberg takes off in some of the later states where he's unloading tens of millions of dollars.          Anti-Trump Republicans attempted a similar strategy in 2016, hoping that the combined votes for Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, along with John Kasich, would deny Trump a majority of delegates. However, Trump benefited from a delegate allocation process that more heavily favored the statewide winner, whereas Democrats allocate delegates proportionately, meaning that even candidates who don’t win a given state can swallow up delegates if they can get to 15% either statewide or in targeted congressional districts.          As an example, when Trump won winner-take-all Florida, he received of the vote, but all 99 of the state’s delegates. In South Carolina, Trump garnered under one-third of the vote, but he claimed all 50 of the state’s delegates because with Cruz and Rubio nearly tied at 22%, Trump was able to win the state and every congressional district. Those two states alone gave him more than 10% of the total needed to capture the Republican nomination. Had the GOP followed Democratic delegate allocation rules, instead of receiving 149 delegates between those two states, Trump likely would have ended up with less than half that amount.          So though it may seem counterintuitive, no matter which one they support, liberals interested in stopping Biden should be rooting for both Warren and Sanders to remain viable for as long as possible.</td>\n",

If Republicans couldn’t unite to blunt Trump, why would Democrats fare any better against Sanders?          That the Democrats managed it speaks to the different mood and dynamic of the party compared with the GOP in 2016.          Four years ago, Republicans loathed their party establishment and had turned their backs on their immediate past president, George W. Bush, who left office saddled with an unpopular war and a devastating financial crisis. Sanders wants to foment a revolution against the Democratic establishment. This resonates with his supporters but isn’t a widespread sentiment within the party.          As Peter Beinart points out in The Atlantic, Bush and his signature initiative, the Iraq War, weren’t popular with Republicans, whereas Barack Obama and his signature initiative, Obamacare, are popular with Democrats.          This made it possible for Biden to run on restoration rather than revolution and find an audience, especially in South Carolina, where many voters told exit pollsters they wanted a return to Obama policies.          It also meant that, as a general matter, pillars of the party establishment hadn’t been discredited. The biggest moment for Biden over the past two weeks was the endorsement of a 14-term congressman and member of congressional leadership who has the credibility to move votes in South Carolina. A jaw-dropping 61 percent of voters said Clyburn’s endorsement was important in their decision.          After Biden’s smashing victory in South Carolina, the party fell in line amazingly quickly. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar got out and endorsed Biden, and former candidate Beto O’Rourke did the same. Buttigieg endorsed after reportedly talking to Obama. It was a collective action of the sort that Republicans couldn’t manage in 2016.          This was in part because there was no one suitable to rally around. Jeb Bush’s association with the two past presidents of his party was a liability because it played into the charge of dynasty and any establishment mobilization on his behalf would have looked untoward. Besides, Jeb Bush had the poor early showings of Biden without the reservoir of support among a key base of voters, like Biden’s strength among African Americans.          It was Ted Cruz who was the only viable alternative to Trump. But no one wanted to come to his aid. He wasn’t a longtime party fixture considered fondly even by his competitors, but an ambitious newcomer who had alienated his colleagues and frightened the establishment. Nor was anyone prepared to defer to him as an elder statesman who had earned “his turn.”          On top of this, Trump scrambled ideological categories with his heterodox candidacy and even piqued the curiosity of elements of the GOP old guard. Sanders, in contrast, catalyzed a straight left vs. moderate fight and occasioned the uniform fear and loathing of the Democratic establishment.          Finally, Republicans wanted to throw caution to the wind. The last two candidates identified with the establishment, John McCain and Mitt Romney, had lost, and the Republican victories in the midterm elections in 2010 and 2014 had delivered less than the party’s base had expected. It was a time for risks and for strong medicine — because, really, how could things get worse?          The mood of a swath of the Democratic Party is the opposite — extreme nervousness about messing up its opportunity to defeat Trump, leading to a cautious, practical-minded focus on electability.          What will be the upshot of the party’s effort to stall Sanders? That we don’t know. Party establishments can fail two ways. They can be ineffectual and they can be wrong. Republicans failed to stop Trump in 2016, at the same time that fears he couldn’t win the election proved unfounded. Meanwhile, Democrats tilted the playing field toward Hillary Clinton and succeeded only in elevating a historically weak candidate particularly ill-suited to running against Trump.          This year, the Democratic establishment may yet again, in much more dire circumstances (Sanders never looked like he was really going to defeat Clintonin 2016), thwart Sanders. Yet the party is throwing itself into the arms of a septuagenarian with serious performance issues for lack of a better alternative. We won’t know if this is a smashing success or grievous mistake, born of desperation, until November.\n",
       "547                                                 Sanders on top: Key takeaways from the Nevada caucuses  LAS VEGAS -- Sen. Bernie Sanders cruised to victory in the Nevada caucuses, heartening his supporters and stoking alarm among moderates who fear he is too liberal and would lose to President Donald Trump.          Sanders' convincing win means there is no longer an asterisk next to his status as the front-runner in the race. He proved his strength with a broad coalition that included Latino voters, union members and African Americans.          Now Sanders claims three victories in a row heading into South Carolina next Saturday, and more important, Super Tuesday on March 3 when about one-third of the delegates needed for the nomination are at stake. The biggest prizes that day, California and Texas, look a lot like Nevada demographically.          Another advantage: His opponents remain splintered and, with the exception of billionaire former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, under-funded to compete across such a vast terrain.          But now there will be extraordinary pressure to try to consolidate moderate support in an effort to stop Sanders' rise. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren will have a decision to make on how much she tries to draw separation from Sanders since they are both competing for the progressive vote.          There is at least one strong note of caution about Sanders' success. In Iowa and New Hampshire he didn't seem to grow the electorate substantially. Data is still out in Nevada.          Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg ran well behind Sanders, but he tried to cast himself as the strongest alternative to Sanders.          In language uncharacteristically blunt, Buttigieg issued a warning to Democrats about the perils of nominating Sanders, whom he characterized as inflexible and whose ideas are not in the American mainstream.          “Sen. Sanders believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans,” Buttigieg told supporters. He held himself out as the only viable alternative. “We can prioritize either ideological purity or inclusive victory,” Buttigieg said.          He added: “Sen. Sanders sees capitalism as the root of all evil. He’d go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support.”          Despite his forceful argument, there’s a serious risk to Buttigieg in the upcoming calendar. He will have to win over black voters in South Carolina, then pivot to a multistate primary with comparatively limited resources. Buttigieg put out a plea for $13 million from donors before Super Tuesday.          The former mayor of a city of 100,000 has repeatedly defied the odds in the presidential nominating contests, but the odds are getting longer.          BIDEN HAS HIS BACK AGAINST A FIREWALL          Former Vice President Joe Biden was hoping Nevada would turn things around for him after a disastrous showing in Iowa and then New Hampshire. He argued that he'd do better in a more diverse state.          But Biden again lost badly even as he told supporters at a union hall, “We’re alive and coming back and we’re gonna win.”          His last and best hope may be to win in South Carolina next Saturday. He’s counting on his support among the state’s black voters — they could make up two-thirds of the voters — to serve as his firewall.          If Biden doesn't win South Carolina, the rationale for his candidacy will much harder to maintain.          In Las Vegas, he tried out a new rallying cry: \"I ain't a socialist. I ain't a plutocrat. I'm a Democrat. And I'm proud of it.\" Party loyalty may be all Biden has left.          MAYBE CULINARY ISN'T ALL-POWERFUL AFTER ALL          The 60,000-member Culinary Workers Local 226 represents workers in the casinos on the Las Vegas strip, and it’s routinely described, correctly, as the most powerful force in the state’s Democratic politics. But it’s not omnipotent.          Culinary didn’t want Sanders to win. It has strongly opposed his “Medicare for All” plan, warning its members that it would eliminate their own generous health plan. Some observers thought the union might end up backing Biden. But after the former vice president’s embarrassing performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, Culinary instead stayed neutral.          The calls from leadership went unheeded by many. Sanders had strong showings in some caucuses in casinos where crowds of Culinary members chanted the Vermont senator’s name and powered him to wins in most casinos. Culinary is driven by its members, many of whom are Sanders supporters, and there was no consensus among the rest about what they should do.          Leadership decided to refrain from a divisive fight, helping pave the way for Sanders’ win. It’s a reminder that even in places like Nevada with strong political institutions, those institutions ultimately derive their power from voters.          Sen. Amy Klobuchar produced one of the few surprises of the race when she surged to a third-place finish in New Hampshire, announced that she had raised more than $12 million, and vowed to prove her doubters wrong.          Her momentum proved short-lived. She finished well behind the leading candidates, and in the process, prompted questions about her viability.          But in a speech to supporters in her home state of Minnesota, she was defiant and said she would continue. She even tried to make a virtue of the fact that Trump mentioned her name at a rally. “By the way, for the first time ever, he mentioned me at a rally,” she said. “You know I’ve arrived now. You know they must be worried.”          Probably not. Time is running out for candidates who haven't finished higher than third in any contest. That also applies to Warren, also desperately needs a win. Her strong debate performance came after much of the state had already cast early votes.          Tom Steyer, the billionaire who made his fortune running a hedge fund, bet heavily in Nevada, more than $12 million on advertising, and lost big, finishing sixth. Steyer has made strong appeals to minority voters, but in Nevada, failed decisively.          But Steyer's impact on the race could come next week in South Carolina, where he has spent even more money. Polls show that he has made significant inroads among African American voters. That would not be good news for Biden, who is counting on those votes to resuscitate his campaign.\n",

With votes still being counted, Biden had secured about 453 delegates on Super Tuesday, according to the Associated Press, capping a dramatic comeback after his campaign was left for dead following the Nevada caucus on Feb. 22. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the self-declared democratic socialist and perceived frontrunner ahead of Tuesday night, had secured 382 delegates. Health care stocks, led by the insurers, soared in response to Biden’s big night. The names had been badly beaten down, underperforming the S&P 500, as Sanders, who is an advocate of Medicare-for-all, climbed in the polls. On Wednesday, Payne said Sanders’ “overwhelming victory in Nevada” and coronavirus fears “both had an effect” on the market. BIDEN SURGES TO VICTORY ACROSS SUPER TUESDAY MAP, AS SANDERS CLAIMS DELEGATE PRIZE IN CALIFORNIA          He then noted that on Wednesday health care stocks surged “a lot more than the overall market.”          “Health care is up 4.4 percent. S&P is up 2.2 percent. It’s up 100 percent more than the rest of the market,” Payne pointed out. “There is a giant sigh of relief that socialism lost last night and that we will not get rid of our entire health care system. There’s a giant sigh of relief on Main Street and some of that is reflected on Wall Street.”          Payne cautioned that the markets overall are still jittery amid the coronavirus outbreak. \"Utility stocks, consumer staples and real estate, those are all considered cautionary places that you put your money when you’re worried, so this is not a runaway market, but it is a sigh of relief.”          Payne went on to say that he thinks that “as we get closer to the actual election, the markets will start to get a little anxious about Biden,\" though not on the same level as the prospect of Sanders winning the nomination.\n",

It is the biggest day in the US election calendar apart from election day itself. The candidates have each held hundreds of meet-and-greet events, travelled thousands of miles, eaten a lot of junk food, and their campaigns have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to get them to this make-or-break moment.          In 2020, Super Tuesday falls on 3 March. Both Democrats and Republicans will be voting, but because Donald Trump does not face any serious challengers, all eyes will be on the Democratic contest.          The early voting states – Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina – have all had their say over the past month, with Bernie Sanders emerging as the possible national frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination.          But now, 14 states across the country – Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia – as well as one US territory (American Samoa) and Democrats abroad will cast their votes on the same day.          Who are the Democratic presidential candidates?          There are eight leading Democratic presidential candidates competing: former vice-president Joe Biden, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, former mayors Mike Bloomberg and Pete Buttigieg, billionaire philanthropist Tom Steyer and Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.          Sanders and Warren are on the progressive side of the party, while candidates such as Biden, Klobuchar, Bloomberg and Buttigieg are regarded as more moderate.          This will be the first time that Bloomberg will be on the ballot, and will be a key test of whether the hundreds of millions of dollars he has invested in his own campaign have paid off. He controversially skipped the first early voting states to concentrate on winning support in larger, delegate heavy states.          The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and US territories, by which the party selects its presidential nominee.          The goal for the candidates is to amass a majority of pledged delegates whose job it is to nominate the candidate at the party’s convention. In all states, delegates are awarded proportionally among top winners.          To become the Democratic presidential nominee, the candidate must secure 1,991 pledged delegates from a total of 4,750.          So far, less than 5% of delegates have been allotted, but on Super Tuesday, more than a third of available delegates are up for grabs – giving it the potential to propel one candidate to frontrunner status, and prompt others who perform badly to quit the race.          California has the most pledged delegates (494) followed by Texas (261), North Carolina (72) and Virginia (65).          The Super Tuesday states also represent a much broader sweep of the US population, not just in terms of geography, but demographics too, than the early voting states. The results will therefore give a more detailed picture of who supports the candidates, and what their chances of winning on a national level may be.          Do all the states vote at the same time?          Polling times vary state by state. Vermont’s polls close first at 7pm ET and California’s close last at 11pm ET.          More than a week ahead of Super Tuesday, almost 2m ballots had already been cast as several states allow early voting.          What time will the results be announced?          Results will begin to be reported after the first polls close at 7pm ET. medianame will be reporting the results live, as they come in.\n",

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are dividing the far-left vote and making it more likely that Joe Biden will win. In reality, the most realistic path that progressives have for denying Biden the nomination likely involves both Warren and Sanders remaining in the race until the bitter end.          On the surface, the argument for why liberals would be better off with either Warren or Sanders in the race rather than both is straightforward. Add their support together in national and early state polls, and they easily surpass Biden. In the run-up to Iowa, the clash between Warren and Sanders would seemingly be an acknowledgment that for one of them to win, they have to take out the other to consolidate the anti-Biden vote.          Even if it were plausibly true that had, say, Sanders decided to stay out of the race and endorse Warren from the get-go, that there would be higher odds of a liberal candidate defeating Biden, that ship has long since sailed. Both candidates will be in the race at least until Iowa. So the question at this point is whether the Left is better off with one of them dropping out early, or with both of them trying to stay in for the long haul.          Biden remains in a position to finish at or near the top in Iowa and New Hampshire, and if he’s able to survive those contests, he has a much better chance of amassing delegates as the race moves to South Carolina and other states with a large percentage of black voters. Thus, if Warren and Sanders fail to bury him in Iowa and New Hampshire, the best shot at stopping Biden may be on the convention floor. The possibility of a contested convention is more likely in 2020 than in most years as a result of the way that Democrats allocate delegates, as well as the size of the field.          Under a rules change, superdelegates who are allowed to vote for any candidate they want are barred from casting a decisive vote on the first ballot. That is, if Biden does not win a majority of delegates outright, then he’ll have to win the nomination when Democrats gather in Milwaukee in July. If both Sanders and Warren can remain viable, it increases the odds that they will be able to deny Biden an outright majority.          Though there may be some degree of overlap between Warren and Sanders voters, their supporters are not interchangeable. Some Warren voters may prefer her policy proposals or simply want somebody younger or female. Sanders voters may view him as more authentically dedicated to the “revolution” or may have bought into the argument that it would be harder for a woman to beat President Trump. A recent Morning Consult found that nearly as many Sanders supporters chose Biden as their second choice (27%) as Warren (30%). Warren supporters were more likely to gravitate to Sanders as their second choice, but still, only 37% of her supporters chose him as the next best option. There is also a “Bernie or bust” crowd that would not vote if he were not on the ballot.          Were Sanders and Warren to both remain in the race through the primaries, they would be able to capture more voters collectively than they would otherwise be able to were only one of them to survive. Biden’s share of the vote will be further carved up if additional candidates, such as Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, do well enough in the early states to stay in or if Michael Bloomberg takes off in some of the later states where he's unloading tens of millions of dollars.          Anti-Trump Republicans attempted a similar strategy in 2016, hoping that the combined votes for Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, along with John Kasich, would deny Trump a majority of delegates. However, Trump benefited from a delegate allocation process that more heavily favored the statewide winner, whereas Democrats allocate delegates proportionately, meaning that even candidates who don’t win a given state can swallow up delegates if they can get to 15% either statewide or in targeted congressional districts.          As an example, when Trump won winner-take-all Florida, he received of the vote, but all 99 of the state’s delegates. In South Carolina, Trump garnered under one-third of the vote, but he claimed all 50 of the state’s delegates because with Cruz and Rubio nearly tied at 22%, Trump was able to win the state and every congressional district. Those two states alone gave him more than 10% of the total needed to capture the Republican nomination. Had the GOP followed Democratic delegate allocation rules, instead of receiving 149 delegates between those two states, Trump likely would have ended up with less than half that amount.          So though it may seem counterintuitive, no matter which one they support, liberals interested in stopping Biden should be rooting for both Warren and Sanders to remain viable for as long as possible."

       "      <td>Donald Trump has claimed Joe Biden is “against God” in an attack on the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate’s faith.          In provocative remarks during a trip to Ohio, a key election battleground, the US president said Biden was “following the radical left agenda”.          Trump added: “Take away your guns, destroy your second amendment. No religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God.          “He’s against God, he’s against guns, he’s against energy, our kind of energy.”          Biden, who is leading in the polls, has frequently spoken about how his Catholic faith helped him cope with the deaths of his first wife and daughter in a 1972 car accident.          In a statement, he said Trump’s comments were “shameful”.          He added: “Like so many people, my faith has been the bedrock foundation of my life: it’s provided me comfort in moments of loss and tragedy, it’s kept me grounded and humbled in times of triumph and joy.          “And in this moment of darkness for our country – of pain, of division, and of sickness for so many Americans – my faith has been a guiding light for me and a constant reminder of the fundamental dignity and humanity that God has bestowed upon all of us.          “For President Trump to attack my faith is shameful. It’s beneath the office he holds and it’s beneath the dignity the American people so rightly expect and deserve from their leaders.”          Biden’s stance on abortion has antagonised many of his fellow Catholics. In 1973, he said the Roe v Wade supreme court decision went “too far”, but now believes Roe v Wade is “the law of the land, a woman has a right to choose”.          Biden is dealing with a controversy of his own, after suggesting the African American community was homogenous – a comment Trump described as “very insulting”.          Biden said: “What you all know but most people don’t know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”          He later tweeted: “Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith – not by identity, not on issues, not at all.          “My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Opinion | A Biden Presidency Could Be Better Than Progressives Think</td>\n",
       "      <td>Biden wouldn’t need to pivot so dramatically to be a transformative progressive president. There are plenty of bleak moments in his record, including his treatment of Anita Hill and his Iraq war vote, but it’s not quite as reactionary as leftists sometimes imagine. Among other things, he’s long been better-than-average on unions; as Jared Bernstein, Biden’s former chief economist, told me, “One of the main things that differentiates Biden from a traditional mainstream Democrat is his understanding of the importance of worker power.”          Still, it’s clear that he’s moving leftward. Biden recently came out for tuition-free college for students whose families earn less than $125,000. He endorsed Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy plan, something that would have been unimaginable in 2005, when Warren, then a Harvard law professor, charged onto the public stage to fight a regressive bankruptcy bill that Biden supported.          After long supporting the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions, Biden gave in to pro-choice pressure to come out against it. His climate plan already went beyond any of Barack Obama’s initiatives, and he’s pledged to make it even more robust. Biden’s health care proposal falls far short of single-payer, but it is, as Paul Waldman wrote in The Washington Post, “surprisingly liberal.”          It will be in Biden’s political interests to try to make good on these commitments. “I’ve worked with him for a while now,” said Jared Bernstein. “He really believes you achieve political success by either doing what you’ve promised to do or getting caught trying like hell.”          In the 20th century, the two presidents with the most substantive records of progressive accomplishment were Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. Liberals nearly revolted on the Democratic convention floor when John F. Kennedy, looking to placate Southern voters, chose Johnson, but he ended up doing far more for liberalism than Kennedy did.          Roosevelt’s future greatness wasn’t obvious to all when he first ran for president. Sounding some of the same notes as Biden’s critics today, the famous political columnist Walter Lippmann wrote: “He is no tribune of the people. He is no enemy of entrenched privilege. He is a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the office, would very much like to be president.”          It may be too much to hope that Biden could equal the achievements of Roosevelt or Johnson. But should he become president, he will, like both of them, inherit a country deep in crisis, where once inconceivable political interventions suddenly appear possible. We can’t know whether he will rise to the opportunity — only that presidencies are shaped by far more than the ideology of the person who achieves the office.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Michigan Gov. Whitmer met with Biden as running mate announcement nears</td>\n",
       "      <td>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer traveled to Delaware last weekend for a private meeting with former Vice President and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, two Democratic officials confirmed to medianame News. News of the meeting was first reported earlier Friday by The Associated Press, which said that the meeting was Biden's first known in-person session with a potential running mate. The meeting lasted several hours, one of the two Democratic officials who confirmed the meeting said. Biden had said he planned to make an announcement the first week in August, but aides later said that was unlikely. Whitmer declined to comment when asked about the meeting. On Thursday, medianame News reported that Whitmer was among those still under serious consideration. Democrats with knowledge of the process have said Whitmer did not recently re-emerge as a potential vice presidential pick but had long remained in Biden’s top tier. Public speculation of a possible pick has also centered around Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., former national security adviser Susan Rice and Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also in the running. Michigan is a battleground state, and President Donald Trump narrowly won it in the 2016 election by around 10,700 votes. Whitmer has earned the respect of Biden officials for her role in responding to the coronavirus pandemic — at times in the face of protests that included demonstrations outside the state capitol building in which some protesters were armed, and a tweet by Trump that read \"Liberate Michigan!\" in capital letters. She elevated her public profile earlier this year by battling with Trump over the federal response to the pandemic. Senior Biden campaign officials have made clear again in recent days that they believe the COVID-19 pandemic combined with Trump’s management of the crisis and the resulting economic fallout is the central issue of the fall campaign.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Biden on Ditching Filibuster: Depends How 'Obstreperous' GOP Becomes</td>\n",
       "      <td>Joe Biden is refusing to rule out scrapping the Senate filibuster, arguing it remains to be seen how “obstreperous” Republicans will be after President Donald Trump leaves office.          The former vice president, who spent a majority of his nearly 40-year political career in the United States Senate, made the remarks on Monday in an interview with several prominent media outlets. Biden, in particular, claimed that while he had “not supported the elimination of the filibuster” in the past, a wait-and-see approach was needed until it was clear how Republicans would act in the post-Trump era.          “I think it’s gonna depend on how obstreperous [Republicans] become,” the former vice president told reporters, as noted by the Washington Post. Biden clarified that he was not necessarily expressing support in one direction or the other. “But I think you’re going to just have to take a look at it.”          The presumptive Democrat nominee added that he was optimistic that his administration would be able to forge a bipartisan consensus among congressional lawmakers, especially if his party were to win the Senate majority.          “I think I have a pretty good record of being able to pull together Democrats and Republicans,” Biden said, further noting that his long tenure in Congress made him “fairly good at understanding what the limitations of a senator [are] and trying to figure out how you help them.”          Biden’s comments on the topic come as a cadre of Democrat lawmakers are in talks to abolish the filibuster, which requires a three-fifths supermajority—usually 60 votes—to end debate on legislation in the Senate. The proposal, still in the early stages, is contingent upon Democrats winning both the White House and the Senate majority this November.          Even though no definitive agreement has been reached, a surprising number of lawmakers, including moderate Democrats, have expressed openness to either discarding or reforming the filibuster in recent weeks. Most notably, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Chris Coons (D-DE) have floated the idea as a way to prevent Republicans from obstructing Biden’s political agenda, provided the presumptive Democrat nominee wins.          “I will not stand idly by for four years and watch the Biden administration’s initiatives blocked at every turn,” Coons, a top congressional ally of the former vice president, said last month.          Progressive Democrats have argued that the filibuster is undemocratic as it allows a minority of lawmakers—at times even only one lawmaker—to hold up legislation favored by a majority of the Senate’s members. As neither party has held a supermajority within the chamber in recent years, bills without broad bipartisan support have gained little traction.          Some progressives, including Biden’s onetime rival and now potential running mate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) favor scrapping the rule in order to advance controversial legislation on topics such as gun control or abortion. Moderates, on the other hand, have defended the filibuster, claiming the limitation it imposed on majority rule was the “entire premise of the Senate” in the first place.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Former Vice President Joe Biden backtracked Saturday after first saying he wouldn’t comply with a Senate subpoena amid President Donald Trump’s trial, noting he would comply with the request.          Biden doubled down Friday on an earlier comment that he would not comply with a possible Senate subpoena. The 2020 presidential candidate tried to clarify his remarks Saturday on Twitter, writing that there would be no “legal basis” for the subpoena.          He later added that he would, in fact, comply if such a request came about, despite originally saying he would reject it.          “I would obey any subpoena that was sent to me,” Biden said Saturday during a town-hall style event in Iowa, the New York Times reported.          Biden’s drastic turn on complying with a subpoena is not the first time he has flip-flopped on an issue. After decades of supporting the death penalty, he tweeted in July that he now wants to “eliminate” it.          Biden also changed his position on the Hyde Amendment after backlash from members of the Democratic party in June. (‘If He’d Take It, Yes’: Biden Open To Nominating Obama For Supreme Court)          The former vice president criticized himself for answering the Senate subpoena question in the first place. He said that “This is going to be the news today” and noted he “shouldn’t even have answered the question.”          “I shouldn’t even have answered the question,” Biden said according to the NYT. “Because in answering the question, now there’s going to be another round.

In provocative remarks during a trip to Ohio, a key election battleground, the US president said Biden was “following the radical left agenda”.          Trump added: “Take away your guns, destroy your second amendment. No religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God.          “He’s against God, he’s against guns, he’s against energy, our kind of energy.”          Biden, who is leading in the polls, has frequently spoken about how his Catholic faith helped him cope with the deaths of his first wife and daughter in a 1972 car accident.          In a statement, he said Trump’s comments were “shameful”.          He added: “Like so many people, my faith has been the bedrock foundation of my life: it’s provided me comfort in moments of loss and tragedy, it’s kept me grounded and humbled in times of triumph and joy.          “And in this moment of darkness for our country – of pain, of division, and of sickness for so many Americans – my faith has been a guiding light for me and a constant reminder of the fundamental dignity and humanity that God has bestowed upon all of us.          “For President Trump to attack my faith is shameful. It’s beneath the office he holds and it’s beneath the dignity the American people so rightly expect and deserve from their leaders.”          Biden’s stance on abortion has antagonised many of his fellow Catholics. In 1973, he said the Roe v Wade supreme court decision went “too far”, but now believes Roe v Wade is “the law of the land, a woman has a right to choose”.          Biden is dealing with a controversy of his own, after suggesting the African American community was homogenous – a comment Trump described as “very insulting”.          Biden said: “What you all know but most people don’t know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”          He later tweeted: “Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith – not by identity, not on issues, not at all.          “My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future.”\n",
       "141     Opinion | A Biden Presidency Could Be Better Than Progressives Think                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Biden wouldn’t need to pivot so dramatically to be a transformative progressive president. There are plenty of bleak moments in his record, including his treatment of Anita Hill and his Iraq war vote, but it’s not quite as reactionary as leftists sometimes imagine. Among other things, he’s long been better-than-average on unions; as Jared Bernstein, Biden’s former chief economist, told me, “One of the main things that differentiates Biden from a traditional mainstream Democrat is his understanding of the importance of worker power.”          Still, it’s clear that he’s moving leftward. Biden recently came out for tuition-free college for students whose families earn less than $125,000. He endorsed Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy plan, something that would have been unimaginable in 2005, when Warren, then a Harvard law professor, charged onto the public stage to fight a regressive bankruptcy bill that Biden supported.          After long supporting the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions, Biden gave in to pro-choice pressure to come out against it. His climate plan already went beyond any of Barack Obama’s initiatives, and he’s pledged to make it even more robust. Biden’s health care proposal falls far short of single-payer, but it is, as Paul Waldman wrote in The Washington Post, “surprisingly liberal.”          It will be in Biden’s political interests to try to make good on these commitments. “I’ve worked with him for a while now,” said Jared Bernstein. “He really believes you achieve political success by either doing what you’ve promised to do or getting caught trying like hell.”          In the 20th century, the two presidents with the most substantive records of progressive accomplishment were Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. Liberals nearly revolted on the Democratic convention floor when John F. Kennedy, looking to placate Southern voters, chose Johnson, but he ended up doing far more for liberalism than Kennedy did.          Roosevelt’s future greatness wasn’t obvious to all when he first ran for president. Sounding some of the same notes as Biden’s critics today, the famous political columnist Walter Lippmann wrote: “He is no tribune of the people. He is no enemy of entrenched privilege. He is a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the office, would very much like to be president.”          It may be too much to hope that Biden could equal the achievements of Roosevelt or Johnson. But should he become president, he will, like both of them, inherit a country deep in crisis, where once inconceivable political interventions suddenly appear possible. We can’t know whether he will rise to the opportunity — only that presidencies are shaped by far more than the ideology of the person who achieves the office.\n",

Gretchen Whitmer traveled to Delaware last weekend for a private meeting with former Vice President and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, two Democratic officials confirmed to medianame News. News of the meeting was first reported earlier Friday by The Associated Press, which said that the meeting was Biden's first known in-person session with a potential running mate. The meeting lasted several hours, one of the two Democratic officials who confirmed the meeting said. Biden had said he planned to make an announcement the first week in August, but aides later said that was unlikely. Whitmer declined to comment when asked about the meeting. On Thursday, medianame News reported that Whitmer was among those still under serious consideration. Democrats with knowledge of the process have said Whitmer did not recently re-emerge as a potential vice presidential pick but had long remained in Biden’s top tier. Public speculation of a possible pick has also centered around Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., former national security adviser Susan Rice and Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also in the running. Michigan is a battleground state, and President Donald Trump narrowly won it in the 2016 election by around 10,700 votes. Whitmer has earned the respect of Biden officials for her role in responding to the coronavirus pandemic — at times in the face of protests that included demonstrations outside the state capitol building in which some protesters were armed, and a tweet by Trump that read \"Liberate Michigan!\" in capital letters. She elevated her public profile earlier this year by battling with Trump over the federal response to the pandemic. Senior Biden campaign officials have made clear again in recent days that they believe the COVID-19 pandemic combined with Trump’s management of the crisis and the resulting economic fallout is the central issue of the fall campaign.\n",
       "215     Biden on Ditching Filibuster: Depends How 'Obstreperous' GOP Becomes  Joe Biden is refusing to rule out scrapping the Senate filibuster, arguing it remains to be seen how “obstreperous” Republicans will be after President Donald Trump leaves office.          The former vice president, who spent a majority of his nearly 40-year political career in the United States Senate, made the remarks on Monday in an interview with several prominent media outlets. Biden, in particular, claimed that while he had “not supported the elimination of the filibuster” in the past, a wait-and-see approach was needed until it was clear how Republicans would act in the post-Trump era.          “I think it’s gonna depend on how obstreperous [Republicans] become,” the former vice president told reporters, as noted by the Washington Post. Biden clarified that he was not necessarily expressing support in one direction or the other. “But I think you’re going to just have to take a look at it.”          The presumptive Democrat nominee added that he was optimistic that his administration would be able to forge a bipartisan consensus among congressional lawmakers, especially if his party were to win the Senate majority.          “I think I have a pretty good record of being able to pull together Democrats and Republicans,” Biden said, further noting that his long tenure in Congress made him “fairly good at understanding what the limitations of a senator [are] and trying to figure out how you help them.”          Biden’s comments on the topic come as a cadre of Democrat lawmakers are in talks to abolish the filibuster, which requires a three-fifths supermajority—usually 60 votes—to end debate on legislation in the Senate. The proposal, still in the early stages, is contingent upon Democrats winning both the White House and the Senate majority this November.          Even though no definitive agreement has been reached, a surprising number of lawmakers, including moderate Democrats, have expressed openness to either discarding or reforming the filibuster in recent weeks. Most notably, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Chris Coons (D-DE) have floated the idea as a way to prevent Republicans from obstructing Biden’s political agenda, provided the presumptive Democrat nominee wins.          “I will not stand idly by for four years and watch the Biden administration’s initiatives blocked at every turn,” Coons, a top congressional ally of the former vice president, said last month.          Progressive Democrats have argued that the filibuster is undemocratic as it allows a minority of lawmakers—at times even only one lawmaker—to hold up legislation favored by a majority of the Senate’s members. As neither party has held a supermajority within the chamber in recent years, bills without broad bipartisan support have gained little traction.          Some progressives, including Biden’s onetime rival and now potential running mate Sen.

Biden doubled down Friday on an earlier comment that he would not comply with a possible Senate subpoena. The 2020 presidential candidate tried to clarify his remarks Saturday on Twitter, writing that there would be no “legal basis” for the subpoena.          He later added that he would, in fact, comply if such a request came about, despite originally saying he would reject it.          “I would obey any subpoena that was sent to me,” Biden said Saturday during a town-hall style event in Iowa, the New York Times reported.          Biden’s drastic turn on complying with a subpoena is not the first time he has flip-flopped on an issue. After decades of supporting the death penalty, he tweeted in July that he now wants to “eliminate” it.          Biden also changed his position on the Hyde Amendment after backlash from members of the Democratic party in June. (‘If He’d Take It, Yes’: Biden Open To Nominating Obama For Supreme Court)          The former vice president criticized himself for answering the Senate subpoena question in the first place. He said that “This is going to be the news today” and noted he “shouldn’t even have answered the question.”          “I shouldn’t even have answered the question,” Biden said according to the NYT. “Because in answering the question, now there’s going to be another round. We’re not talking about: What did Trump do?”"

       "      <td>President Barack Obama’s chief campaign strategist and senior adviser David Axelrod said that even if President Trump is impeached, it is not likely he will be convicted by the Senate and removed from office.          Appearing on CNN Tuesday evening after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry, Axelrod, 64, tossed water on some lawmakers’ hopes that impeachment would successfully remove Trump from the White House.          “This is a moment of extraordinary historical import,” Axelrod noted. “Only three presidents in history who were impeached. But it’s also true that no president in history has ever been convicted and removed from office and it is very, very unlikely that that’s going to happen here.\"          He pointed out that a large number of Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate would have to vote with the Democrats in order to form the 67 votes needed to oust the president.          “We should be sober about it. But we also kind of know how this story is going to end,” Axelrod said. “Donald Trump is not going to be removed from office, but this is overhang that he will have to deal with over the next many months as he is seeking reelection.”          Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were the only presidents to have been impeached by the House of Representatives, though neither were convicted.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Honor a congressional subpoena to appear at President Trump’s (presumably eventual) Senate impeachment trial? Joe Biden, still the odds-on favorite to be the Democrats’ standard-bearer in the 2020 election, scoffed at the very idea: No way! The former vice president’s knee-jerk obstinacy illuminates — we should say, provides even more illumination of — the patent farce that is the second article of impeachment passed by the House on a strict party-line vote: the accusation that the president has obstructed Congress. As we saw in a committee hearing, featuring the spectacle of staffers questioning staffers with no actual fact witnesses in sight, Democrats have no problem when Democrats blow off congressional demands for information. “Obstruction” is a one-way street. Trump regards the impeachment inquiry as a partisan witch hunt, just the latest phase of the Democrats’ project to remove him, which began even before his term started. He certainly has a point, although that is not a good reason to give his opponents fuel for the project, as he did by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden. That is the allegation in the first article of impeachment. Under the circumstances, I believe it falls well short of the egregious misconduct for which impeachment should be reserved; it was, nevertheless, a foolish thing for the president to do. Let’s focus, though, on the second impeachment article, obstruction of Congress. To be clear, Congress has undeniable constitutional authority, broad in scope, to conduct oversight of the executive branch. The president, with all the authority of a peer branch of government, has extensive privileges of confidentiality, rooted in Article II, particularly when it comes to communications with his staff and high executive officials. Congress, however, is empowered to probe, especially when its concern is presidential malfeasance, or the activities of executive branch agencies Congress has created — such agencies, after all, are led by officers subject to Senate confirmation, and Congress both underwrites them with taxpayer funds and limits their operations by statute.</td>\n",

       "      <td>GOP congressman blasts Trump for quoting evangelical pastor's ‘civil war’ threat: ‘This is beyond repugnant’</td>\n",
       "      <td>Appearing on Fox News on Sunday, Robert Jeffress — one of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical sycophants — asserted that Trump’s impeachment could cause “a Civil War-like fracture” in the United States. Trump repeated Jeffress’ assertion on Twitter — and got an angry response from a fellow Republican: Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.          Jeffress, pastor at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, is a prominent figure on the Christian Right. And during his Sunday appearance on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends,” Jeffress insisted to co-hosts Pete Hegseth and Jedediah Bila that Trump has done nothing to deserve impeachment and attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for supporting an impeachment inquiry — stressing, “I do want to make this prediction this morning: if the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, I’m afraid it will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal.”          On Twitter, Trump quoted Jeffress and zeroed right in on the Civil War part:          Upon seeing Trump’s post, Kinzinger angrily tweeted in response, “I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.”          A 41-year-old military veteran who served in the U.S. Air Force during the Iraq War, Kinzinger was first elected to the House as a Republican in 2010.          Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives because of a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript/summary of that conversation shows that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into digging up dirt on a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden — which Pelosi, formerly the Democratic Party’s most prominent opponent of impeaching Trump, considers an impeachable offense.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trump impeachment inquiry sparked by effort to uncover ‘witch hunt’ origins</td>\n",
       "      <td>At the heart of the infamous Ukraine phone call that prompted House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is President Trump’s vow to get to the bottom of the origins of the Russia probe, which dominated the first two-plus years of his presidency.          In trying to uncover how the “witch hunt” began, Mr. Trump now faces a bigger political crisis.          The Trump campaign came out swinging this weekend against impeachment, launching a $10 million TV and digital ad accusing Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden of meddling in Ukraine. Political insiders say it’s a strong indication of how Mr. Trump intends to fight back.          “He’ll be very aggressive,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. “I think ultimately his game plan is to make sure the base is with him. He understands this is a political fight, not a legal fight, and he’s going to play politics. He knows that if he loses the base, he loses the game.”          Mr. Trump and his aides in the early days of the crisis have gone on the attack against an unnamed government whistleblower who prompted the charges while also firing back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Chairman Adam B. Schiff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The White House message is that this latest political peril for Mr. Trump is all part of the same partisan hatred that has dogged him from the start.          “There are no high crimes and misdemeanors here,” said White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. “People were talking about impeaching this president before he even got inaugurated. And now they’re getting their wish. Nancy Pelosi finally capitulated to her angry mob.”          She said the American people “will see what’s not getting done” in Congress while Democrats devote their attention to impeaching Mr. Trump in a strong economy.          The president also echoed a prediction Sunday by Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel that the Democrats’ impeachment effort will backfire, especially in Democratic House districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016.          “Will happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in 50 Trump type Districts,” the president tweeted. “We will win big!”          In trying to sustain his 2020 reelection bid, Mr. Trump is still fighting a battle over his 2016 campaign.          The president’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 started with pleasantries, but quickly shifted Mr. Trump’s interest in a missing Democratic National Committee server that was hacked by Russia during the 2016 election.          “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine … The server, they say Ukraine has it,” the president told Mr. Zelensky.          He also mentioned the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which the DNC hired in 2016 to investigate the breach of its servers and first reported Russia as the culprit.          The president’s conversation took place a day after special counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress, an appearance that was criticized as weak. Mr. Mueller did confirm the findings of his report, which found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the election.          “As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance,” Mr. Trump told Ukraine’s leader. “But they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”          The Justice Department has announced that U.S. attorney John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane” probe into alleged links between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia, was already looking into whether the Ukrainian government led by then-President Petro Poroshenko was involved in the effort to torpedo Mr. Trump’s candidacy.          Mr. Zelensky raised the name of the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani had canceled a trip to Ukraine last spring to investigate whether the previous Ukrainian administration helped Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign by providing information concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s lobbying work in the country.          Mr. Giuliani also was probing why Ukraine fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who had been looking into Hunter Biden’s lucrative position with a Ukrainian energy company.          “This is what they [Democrats] did to Manafort,” said veteran Washington lawyer John Down, who represented the president in the Mueller probe. “They went overseas and they dug all this stuff up. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”          The Hill reported in May that the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington said a Democratic National Committee contractor solicited dirt on Manafort during the 2016 campaign and even tried to enlist the country’s president to help.          The contractor later tried to arrange for Mr. Poroshenko to comment on Manafort’s Russian ties during a visit to the U.S. during the 2016 campaign, the Ukrainian ambassador said.          As for Mr. Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, the president’s conservative allies also believe there is a potential connection to the origins of the Russia allegations against Mr. Trump.          “Biden was responsible for U.S. policy in Ukraine during the Obama administration, and much of the false narrative about President Donald Trump being a Russian agent came from Ukraine, the United Kingdom and other Western intelligence agencies, which his administration put a bow on and shipped to the FISA court so they could spy on the Trump campaign in 2016,” said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government. “What did Joe Biden know about Russiagate and when did he know it?”          The president also has directed most of his campaign criticism at Mr. Biden, perceiving him as his likeliest — and probably toughest — opponent in the general election. He’s gone to considerable lengths to take him out early during the Democratic primary, openly questioning his fitness for office.          “I think he’s the weakest mentally, and I like running against people that are weak mentally,” the president said of Mr. Biden last summer.          Democrats are using the president’s effort to investigate the Bidens in Ukraine as their primary argument for impeachment, accusing the president of seeking foreign help in interfering in a U.S. election. Mr. Biden is, for now, still the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.          At the time of the phone call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine.          “I think we have to stay focused as far as the public is concerned on the fact that the president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday.          Mrs. Pelosi also suggested that Russia played a role in the saga.          “It is wrong for any foreign government to interfere in our elections and here you have the president of the United States asking for that,” she said without elaborating. “I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way.”          The White House ended the week with Mr. Trump declaring “we’re at war” with the Democrats. The president and his allies were also questioning the motives of the unnamed government whistleblower, who’s reportedly a CIA officer.          Mr. Trump last week also suggested he could go to court to stop the Democrats.          “There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts,” Mr. Trump said.          Even some Republicans close to the White House say impeachment is a real concern.          “I think there’s a good chance of impeachment,” said one administration ally. “Will he be removed [by the Senate]? No. Will he even care? I think he thinks it would be one more big reality TV moment, and he’s the star of it.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>We've grown used to radical Leftists, in Congress and the media, having their soup de jour, the accusation of the day. But this latest one has actually prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry. What is the accusation? President Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president to congratulate him on his election and discussed several things, including the investigation of alleged illegal conduct on the part of the son of a prominent American politician. This is just another fail. Within the past few weeks, the Left has floated impeaching Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, criticized Vice President Mike Pence for an extended stay during a visit to his foreign, historical family home, melted down over the President’s invitation of national leaders of the G7 to one of his properties, and most ludicrously, blasted him for allegedly stealing pancakes. HANS VON SPAKOVSKY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT EFFORT WILL BE HISTORIC POLITICAL BATTLE – HERE'S HOW THE PROCESS WORKS          The media wonders why its credibility is in the dumpster. The Left wonders why the President has the approval of most Americans, higher than former President Barack Obama at the same juncture of his term. The standard bearer of the latest effort to impeach President Trump is Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of the House intelligence Committee. You will remember him for his zealous advocacy for reliance on the Mueller Report. Schiff promised that evidence of Russian collusion was real, present, and would be confirmed in the Mueller Report. Oops. The Mueller investigation did not support Schiff’s promised conclusion. In fact, it found that there was no collusion, cooperation or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. So here we are again. The Democrats desire to get the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This seems wholly unwarranted based on the allegations of an unknown person, who probably did not even hear the conversation. This individual apparently heard about the conversation from someone else. Such testimony would never be allowed in court because it is inherently unreliable. And, it reveals something about the way things work in the White House. It seems that the President has no private conversations with leaders of foreign countries. I suspect that the leaders of other nations understand that those conversations are scrutinized by the U.S. intelligence apparatus. But I also believe that foreign leaders do not anticipate that Americans are so cavalier as to transcribe these conversations and then pass them on to Congress, which seems to have the loosest of lips. In fact, foreign leaders probably do not realize there is a threat that their conversations could be leaked, if given to Schiff, a person that former Congressman Trey Gowdy has described as leakier than a screen-door on a submarine. What do the Ukrainian leaders have to say about the content of the conversation? Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko says there were no threats. There was nothing untoward or out of the ordinary in the conversation. Joe Biden once bragged that he had been in Ukraine and demanded that its leaders fire a prosecutor who was investigating allegations of wrongdoing of an international energy company, or else. Oh, by the way, Biden’s son, Hunter, sat on the board of directors of that company. Was it out of line to inquire of an American who was under investigation by the Ukrainians? They projected a false narrative for years, creating a division in our nation that may not heal for a generation, that the Trump administration is illegitimate because of Russian “collusion” in the 2016 election. But, it turns out, that Ukrainians donated tens of millions of dollars to the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee. In fact, the Ukraine government voted to investigate that. Prediction: the Left will persist in its quixotic quest to remove President Donald Trump. And, when the Ukraine telephone gambit fades, look for the next stolen pancake allegation to consume our misguided friends.</td>\n",

strategist and senior adviser David Axelrod said that even if President Trump is impeached, it is not likely he will be convicted by the Senate and removed from office.          Appearing on CNN Tuesday evening after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry, Axelrod, 64, tossed water on some lawmakers’ hopes that impeachment would successfully remove Trump from the White House.          “This is a moment of extraordinary historical import,” Axelrod noted. “Only three presidents in history who were impeached. But it’s also true that no president in history has ever been convicted and removed from office and it is very, very unlikely that that’s going to happen here.\"          He pointed out that a large number of Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate would have to vote with the Democrats in order to form the 67 votes needed to oust the president.          “We should be sober about it. But we also kind of know how this story is going to end,” Axelrod said. “Donald Trump is not going to be removed from office, but this is overhang that he will have to deal with over the next many months as he is seeking reelection.”          Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were the only presidents to have been impeached by the House of Representatives, though neither were convicted.\n",

Honor a congressional subpoena to appear at President Trump’s (presumably eventual) Senate impeachment trial? Joe Biden, still the odds-on favorite to be the Democrats’ standard-bearer in the 2020 election, scoffed at the very idea: No way! The former vice president’s knee-jerk obstinacy illuminates — we should say, provides even more illumination of — the patent farce that is the second article of impeachment passed by the House on a strict party-line vote: the accusation that the president has obstructed Congress. As we saw in a committee hearing, featuring the spectacle of staffers questioning staffers with no actual fact witnesses in sight, Democrats have no problem when Democrats blow off congressional demands for information. “Obstruction” is a one-way street. Trump regards the impeachment inquiry as a partisan witch hunt, just the latest phase of the Democrats’ project to remove him, which began even before his term started. He certainly has a point, although that is not a good reason to give his opponents fuel for the project, as he did by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden. That is the allegation in the first article of impeachment. Under the circumstances, I believe it falls well short of the egregious misconduct for which impeachment should be reserved; it was, nevertheless, a foolish thing for the president to do. Let’s focus, though, on the second impeachment article, obstruction of Congress. To be clear, Congress has undeniable constitutional authority, broad in scope, to conduct oversight of the executive branch. The president, with all the authority of a peer branch of government, has extensive privileges of confidentiality, rooted in Article II, particularly when it comes to communications with his staff and high executive officials. Congress, however, is empowered to probe, especially when its concern is presidential malfeasance, or the activities of executive branch agencies Congress has created — such agencies, after all, are led by officers subject to Senate confirmation, and Congress both underwrites them with taxpayer funds and limits their operations by statute.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Appearing on Fox News on Sunday, Robert Jeffress — one of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical sycophants — asserted that Trump’s impeachment could cause “a Civil War-like fracture” in the United States. Trump repeated Jeffress’ assertion on Twitter — and got an angry response from a fellow Republican: Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.          Jeffress, pastor at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, is a prominent figure on the Christian Right. And during his Sunday appearance on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends,” Jeffress insisted to co-hosts Pete Hegseth and Jedediah Bila that Trump has done nothing to deserve impeachment and attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for supporting an impeachment inquiry — stressing, “I do want to make this prediction this morning: if the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, I’m afraid it will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal.”          On Twitter, Trump quoted Jeffress and zeroed right in on the Civil War part:          Upon seeing Trump’s post, Kinzinger angrily tweeted in response, “I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.”          A 41-year-old military veteran who served in the U.S. Air Force during the Iraq War, Kinzinger was first elected to the House as a Republican in 2010.          Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives because of a July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript/summary of that conversation shows that Trump tried to pressure Zelensky into digging up dirt on a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden — which Pelosi, formerly the Democratic Party’s most prominent opponent of impeaching Trump, considers an impeachable offense.\n",
       "223                                   Trump impeachment inquiry sparked by effort to uncover ‘witch hunt’ origins  At the heart of the infamous Ukraine phone call that prompted House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is President Trump’s vow to get to the bottom of the origins of the Russia probe, which dominated the first two-plus years of his presidency.          In trying to uncover how the “witch hunt” began, Mr. Trump now faces a bigger political crisis.          The Trump campaign came out swinging this weekend against impeachment, launching a $10 million TV and digital ad accusing Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden of meddling in Ukraine. Political insiders say it’s a strong indication of how Mr. Trump intends to fight back.          “He’ll be very aggressive,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. “I think ultimately his game plan is to make sure the base is with him. He understands this is a political fight, not a legal fight, and he’s going to play politics. He knows that if he loses the base, he loses the game.”          Mr. Trump and his aides in the early days of the crisis have gone on the attack against an unnamed government whistleblower who prompted the charges while also firing back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Chairman Adam B. Schiff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The White House message is that this latest political peril for Mr. Trump is all part of the same partisan hatred that has dogged him from the start.          “There are no high crimes and misdemeanors here,” said White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. “People were talking about impeaching this president before he even got inaugurated. And now they’re getting their wish. Nancy Pelosi finally capitulated to her angry mob.”          She said the American people “will see what’s not getting done” in Congress while Democrats devote their attention to impeaching Mr. Trump in a strong economy.          The president also echoed a prediction Sunday by Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel that the Democrats’ impeachment effort will backfire, especially in Democratic House districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016.          “Will happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in 50 Trump type Districts,” the president tweeted. “We will win big!”          In trying to sustain his 2020 reelection bid, Mr. Trump is still fighting a battle over his 2016 campaign.          The president’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 started with pleasantries, but quickly shifted Mr. Trump’s interest in a missing Democratic National Committee server that was hacked by Russia during the 2016 election.          “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine … The server, they say Ukraine has it,” the president told Mr. Zelensky.          He also mentioned the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which the DNC hired in 2016 to investigate the breach of its servers and first reported Russia as the culprit.          The president’s conversation took place a day after special counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress, an appearance that was criticized as weak. Mr. Mueller did confirm the findings of his report, which found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the election.          “As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance,” Mr. Trump told Ukraine’s leader. “But they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”          The Justice Department has announced that U.S. attorney John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane” probe into alleged links between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia, was already looking into whether the Ukrainian government led by then-President Petro Poroshenko was involved in the effort to torpedo Mr. Trump’s candidacy.          Mr. Zelensky raised the name of the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani had canceled a trip to Ukraine last spring to investigate whether the previous Ukrainian administration helped Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign by providing information concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s lobbying work in the country.          Mr. Giuliani also was probing why Ukraine fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who had been looking into Hunter Biden’s lucrative position with a Ukrainian energy company.          “This is what they [Democrats] did to Manafort,” said veteran Washington lawyer John Down, who represented the president in the Mueller probe. “They went overseas and they dug all this stuff up. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”          The Hill reported in May that the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington said a Democratic National Committee contractor solicited dirt on Manafort during the 2016 campaign and even tried to enlist the country’s president to help.          The contractor later tried to arrange for Mr. Poroshenko to comment on Manafort’s Russian ties during a visit to the U.S. during the 2016 campaign, the Ukrainian ambassador said.          As for Mr. Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, the president’s conservative allies also believe there is a potential connection to the origins of the Russia allegations against Mr. Trump.          “Biden was responsible for U.S. policy in Ukraine during the Obama administration, and much of the false narrative about President Donald Trump being a Russian agent came from Ukraine, the United Kingdom and other Western intelligence agencies, which his administration put a bow on and shipped to the FISA court so they could spy on the Trump campaign in 2016,” said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government. “What did Joe Biden know about Russiagate and when did he know it?”          The president also has directed most of his campaign criticism at Mr. Biden, perceiving him as his likeliest — and probably toughest — opponent in the general election. He’s gone to considerable lengths to take him out early during the Democratic primary, openly questioning his fitness for office.          “I think he’s the weakest mentally, and I like running against people that are weak mentally,” the president said of Mr. Biden last summer.          Democrats are using the president’s effort to investigate the Bidens in Ukraine as their primary argument for impeachment, accusing the president of seeking foreign help in interfering in a U.S. election. Mr. Biden is, for now, still the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.          At the time of the phone call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine.          “I think we have to stay focused as far as the public is concerned on the fact that the president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday.          Mrs. Pelosi also suggested that Russia played a role in the saga.          “It is wrong for any foreign government to interfere in our elections and here you have the president of the United States asking for that,” she said without elaborating. “I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way.”          The White House ended the week with Mr. Trump declaring “we’re at war” with the Democrats. The president and his allies were also questioning the motives of the unnamed government whistleblower, who’s reportedly a CIA officer.          Mr. Trump last week also suggested he could go to court to stop the Democrats.          “There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts,” Mr. Trump said.          Even some Republicans close to the White House say impeachment is a real concern.          “I think there’s a good chance of impeachment,” said one administration ally. “Will he be removed [by the Senate]?

But this latest one has actually prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry. What is the accusation? President Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president to congratulate him on his election and discussed several things, including the investigation of alleged illegal conduct on the part of the son of a prominent American politician. This is just another fail. Within the past few weeks, the Left has floated impeaching Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, criticized Vice President Mike Pence for an extended stay during a visit to his foreign, historical family home, melted down over the President’s invitation of national leaders of the G7 to one of his properties, and most ludicrously, blasted him for allegedly stealing pancakes. HANS VON SPAKOVSKY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT EFFORT WILL BE HISTORIC POLITICAL BATTLE – HERE'S HOW THE PROCESS WORKS          The media wonders why its credibility is in the dumpster. The Left wonders why the President has the approval of most Americans, higher than former President Barack Obama at the same juncture of his term. The standard bearer of the latest effort to impeach President Trump is Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of the House intelligence Committee. You will remember him for his zealous advocacy for reliance on the Mueller Report. Schiff promised that evidence of Russian collusion was real, present, and would be confirmed in the Mueller Report. Oops. The Mueller investigation did not support Schiff’s promised conclusion. In fact, it found that there was no collusion, cooperation or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. So here we are again. The Democrats desire to get the transcript of the conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This seems wholly unwarranted based on the allegations of an unknown person, who probably did not even hear the conversation. This individual apparently heard about the conversation from someone else. Such testimony would never be allowed in court because it is inherently unreliable. And, it reveals something about the way things work in the White House. It seems that the President has no private conversations with leaders of foreign countries. I suspect that the leaders of other nations understand that those conversations are scrutinized by the U.S. intelligence apparatus. But I also believe that foreign leaders do not anticipate that Americans are so cavalier as to transcribe these conversations and then pass them on to Congress, which seems to have the loosest of lips. In fact, foreign leaders probably do not realize there is a threat that their conversations could be leaked, if given to Schiff, a person that former Congressman Trey Gowdy has described as leakier than a screen-door on a submarine. What do the Ukrainian leaders have to say about the content of the conversation? Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko says there were no threats. There was nothing untoward or out of the ordinary in the conversation. Joe Biden once bragged that he had been in Ukraine and demanded that its leaders fire a prosecutor who was investigating allegations of wrongdoing of an international energy company, or else. Oh, by the way, Biden’s son, Hunter, sat on the board of directors of that company. Was it out of line to inquire of an American who was under investigation by the Ukrainians? They projected a false narrative for years, creating a division in our nation that may not heal for a generation, that the Trump administration is illegitimate because of Russian “collusion” in the 2016 election. But, it turns out, that Ukrainians donated tens of millions of dollars to the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee. In fact, the Ukraine government voted to investigate that. Prediction: the Left will persist in its quixotic quest to remove President Donald Trump. And, when the Ukraine telephone gambit fades, look for the next stolen pancake allegation to consume our misguided friends."

       "      <td>Senate rejects new witnesses in Trump impeachment trial, paving the way for acquittal</td>\n",
       "      <td>— The Senate rejected a motion to allow consideration of additional witnesses and documents in President Trump's impeachment trial, rebuffing Democrats and virtually ensuring the president's ultimate acquittal on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate will hold the final vote Wednesday on the two articles of impeachment.          The motion failed by a vote of 49 to 51. Democrats failed to convince four Republicans to join them in voting to allow new evidence, with just two GOP lawmakers — Senators Susan Collins and Mitt Romney — crossing the aisle.          The Senate adjourned Friday around 8 p.m. and will reconvene Monday at 11 a.m. The Senate approved Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's timeline for the rest of the trial: Closing arguments will be Monday, senators will give speeches Monday through Wednesday and the final vote will occur Wednesday.          Earlier in the day, Republicans and the president's legal team argued the introduction of new witnesses and documents would prolong the trial for weeks or months.          They also warned the move would set a precedent of the Senate conducting its own impeachment investigation, arguing the House should have exhausted its options to compel testimony before impeaching the president. Some Republicans conceded the president acted improperly by pressuring Ukraine, but said removing him from office would lead to more frequent and more partisan impeachment proceedings.          \"If this shallow, hurried and wholly partisan impeachment were to succeed, it would rip the country apart, pouring gasoline on the fire of cultural divisions that already exist,\" Senator Lamar Alexander, one of the Republicans who was on the fence, said in a statement Thursday. \"It would create the weapon of perpetual impeachment to be used against future presidents whenever the House of Representatives is of a different political party.\"          The House managers, however, warned that failing to pursue new testimony from officials like former national security adviser John Bolton would set a \"very dangerous and long-lasting precedent\" that would \"nullify\" Congress' impeachment power.          \"This will set a new precedent. This will be cited in impeachment trials from this point until the end of history,\" Schiff said. \"You can bet that in every impeachment that follows, whether it's a presidential impeachment or the impeachment of a judge, if that judge or president believes that it is to his or her advantage that there will be a trial with no witnesses, they will cite the case of Donald J. Trump.\"          New revelations by former national security adviser John Bolton hung over Friday's vote and served to punctuate Democrats' arguments. The Senate reconvened just after The New York Times reported new details from a manuscript of Bolton's upcoming book.          Bolton writes, according to The Times, that the president instructed him to call the president of Ukraine and tell him to meet with Rudy Giuliani in May 2019. Bolton's reported account is the earliest indication of the president's direct involvement in the campaign to get Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Bolton has said he would appear before the Senate if he was subpoenaed.          for complete coverage of the president's impeachment trial in the Senate.

       "      <td>Joe Biden Nixes Deal That Would Have Him Testify In Senate Impeachment Trial</td>\n",
       "      <td>Former Vice President Joe Biden has dashed Senate Democrats’ hopes that he might submit to a witness trade, testifying in front of President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial in return for testimony from former White House national security advisor, John Bolton.          Biden was asked about the deal during a campaign stop in Iowa, and while he admitted that the issue wasn’t “irrational” he claimed Trump’s trial centered around a “Constitutional issue,” rather than one involving his and his son’s work in Ukraine. Testifying in front of the Senate, Biden added, would turn the trial into “some kind of farce or political theater,” as if it wasn’t already headed in that direction.          Ultimately, Biden says, he wants “no part” of any deal that would require he testify so that a White House official would also take the stand.          Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz floated the idea initially but, according to reports that surfaced yesterday, a group of Senate Democrats were seriously considering a testimony trade just so that Senate Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, would cave to the idea of hosting some witness testimony during the Senate impeachment trial.          Democrats have been desperate to find some way to get witnesses on the Senate floor, ostensibly to help close holes left in the Democrats’ case against the president from the House impeachment inquiry. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) tried, valiantly, to force McConnell to welcome testimony by withholding the articles of impeachment from the Senate, but even moderate Republicans, who were the deciding factor, said they’d prefer the case be set out in full by the Senate impeachment managers.          On Tuesday, in a vote that came near midnight, the Senate voted against allowing witness testimony during the first part of Trump’s Senate trial, but several Senators — including those same moderate Republicans — reserved the right to reverse their vote if, after the two sides present their opening arguments, questions remained about the president’s behavior.          Tuesday night, Democrats met in secret to discuss the Biden for Bolton trade (though, at the time, it wasn’t clear whether they would have given up Joe Biden or his son Hunter, whose involvement in Ukrainian oil and gas company, Burisma, is at the center of what Democrats claim is a “quid-pro-quo” agreement between Trump and the Ukrainian government, foreign aid in return for an investigation into both Bidens’ roles in how Burisma was treated by Ukrainian prosecutors back during the Obama Administration.          Democrats in charge of the trial seemed reticent to ink the deal and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), one of the House’s seven “impeachment managers,” openly decried the issue, calling it “irrelevant.” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), a key “Resistance” figure in Congress added that Hunter Biden’s testimony would be “irrelevant,” and that only Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney would need to testify.          If the Senate does vote to allow witnesses, it will be up to Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, to determine which witnesses are “relevant” to the task at hand.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Now that they’ve passed an impeachment bill, Democrats are slow-walking the process in a bid to secure procedural guarantees from Senate Republicans on how the trial will unfold.          Now that the House of Representatives has voted to impeach President Trump, action shifts to the Senate, whose members are charged by the Constitution to determine whether he should be convicted or acquitted. Yet wary Democrats are slow-walking the process in a bid to secure procedural guarantees from Senate Republicans on how the trial will unfold.          The House must first appoint members who will manage its case during the trial. When that happens, the House can notify the Senate of its decision to impeach the president and appoint managers.          According to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House will refrain from appointing managers until Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., agree on the ground rules that will govern the trial. At issue are whether the Senate will call additional witnesses and how long the trial will last.          Schumer wants the Senate to call particular witnesses (namely those who refused to testify during the House’s impeachment inquiry). But McConnell doesn’t think witnesses are needed and wants the trial wrapped up quickly.          Notwithstanding the McConnell-Schumer impasse, the House’s decision to appoint managers and notify the Senate is a major development. It formally begins the impeachment process under the Senate’s existing rules and practices. The Senate’s “Rules of Procedure When Sitting On Impeachment Trials” (i.e., the Impeachment Rules) stipulate clearly that senators must consider articles of impeachment once they arrive from the House. In short, the Senate must hold a trial; senators must act.          According to Rule II of the Impeachment Rules, proceedings begin as soon as the House managers arrive at “the bar of the Senate” to exhibit their articles of impeachment against President Trump. After the presentation of the articles, the rules stipulate that the presiding officer informs the House managers that the Senate will notify the House when it has organized for trial. The House managers then leave the Senate.          After the withdrawal of the House managers, the impeachment rules require it to organize for the trial. The first order of business under Rule III is the need to administer oaths to senators and their presiding officer.          The Constitution (Article I, section 3, clause 6) requires the chief justice of the United States to preside in a presidential impeachment trial such as this one. In that case, Rule IV details the procedures that senators follow to administer the oaths. Specifically, the presiding officer first administers the oath mentioned above to the chief justice. The chief justice then administers the oath to senators, en bloc.          After the administration of oaths, the impeachment rules stipulate that the chief justice instructs the sergeant at arms to announce the beginning of the trial. Rule III requires the Senate to remain in session “from day to day…after the trial shall commence (unless otherwise ordered by the Senate) until final judgment shall be rendered” (Sundays excepted).          “Unless otherwise ordered by the Senate” underscores the fact that senators can adopt a different trial schedule by passing a resolution to that effect. Senators may also suspend the impeachment trial by unanimous consent to consider legislative and executive business.          Under Rule VIII, senators must issue a writ of summons setting the date on which the president must respond to the accusations against him. (The Senate also sets the date on which the House managers respond to the president’s response.) Rule XXV even prescribes the text of the summons.          Under the Senate’s regular rules (i.e., its “Standing Rules”), senators could filibuster the writ of summons. But under its impeachment rules, such dilatory tactics are prohibited to ensure that the trial is not delayed and that a verdict is reached. Rule XXIV stipulates that “all the orders and decisions may be acted upon without objection” during the trial. If senators object, “the orders and decisions shall be voted on without debate by yeas and nays….subject to the operation of Rule VII.”          Rule VII requires the presiding officer to “direct all the forms of proceedings while the Senate is sitting for the purpose of trying an impeachment.” In that capacity, senators expect the presiding officer to rule on questions of evidence (i.e., issues of relevancy, materiality, redundancy) and any “incidental questions” that may arise during the trial.          The presiding officer may rule when presented with such questions, or he may submit them directly to the Senate to be decided. If the presiding officer does rule on a question raised during the trial, any senator may appeal it and ask for a “formal vote.”          Regardless of how questions are decided, the impeachment rules prohibit debate. That means the Senate votes immediately whenever questions arise during a trial, and the side with more votes (i.e., a simple majority) wins.          While the Senate’s impeachment rules permit limited debate during closed sessions, senators are allowed only one speech each in such circumstances under the provisions of Rule XXIV. The rule also caps speeches on “interlocutory questions” at ten minutes.          The Senate may adopt supplementary rules to structure impeachment proceedings. During the 1999 Bill Clinton impeachment trial, senators approved two supplementary rules packages (S. Res. 16 and S. Res. 30). S. Res. 16 set the dates by which the president was required to respond to the articles of impeachment and by which the House managers were required to respond to the president’s response. It also set aside a 16-hour block of time for senators to question the parties.          Res. 30 authorized the deposition of particular witnesses and delegated to the majority and minority leaders the power to determine the deposition time for all witnesses. The resolution also empowered House managers and the president’s counsel to make a motion to resolve any objections made during the depositions after a short review period.          Democrats and Republicans alike cite the Clinton procedures as a model for what the Senate should do today. Schumer references them in a letter he sent McConnell outlining his proposal on how the trial should proceed.          McConnell appears to agree with Schumer when it comes to the benefits of the structured approach adopted by the Senate in 1999, stating that “the basic procedural framework of the Clinton impeachment trial served the Senate and the nation well, in my view…I still believe the Senate should try to follow the 1999 model.”          This agreement between McConnell and Schumer on the basic need for supplementary rules suggests that a package is likely to be approved when the Senate reconvenes after the holidays, with or without naming particular witnesses. In the unlikely event that the McConnell-Schumer talks break down, the fact that the Senate has 26 rules and a substantial body of precedents to govern its proceedings when sitting as a court of impeachment suggests that it will be able to conduct the trial.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BREAKING: Senator Hawley Drafts Motions To Subpoena Bidens, Schiff, Whistleblower</td>\n",
       "      <td>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-SC), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has drafted motions to subpoena Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, his son, Hunter Biden, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), and the Ukraine whistleblower.          “The Missouri Republican is preparing to file subpoena requests for witnesses and documents that Democrats and Republicans alike won’t want to vote on, a tactic intended to convince a handful of senators to sink a vote next week to consider new evidence in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial,” Politico reported. “Hawley’s strategy harmonizes with plans from GOP Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky to force votes to hear from Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son who was on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.”          On Twitter, Hawley wrote, “I have drafted motions to subpoena Adam Schiff, the ‘whistleblower,’ Hunter Biden, and Joe Biden to testify. If the Senate calls witnesses, I will ask for votes on all these next week.”          Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has sought to create a narrative that Senate Republicans are engaged in a cover-up because they are not allowing additional witnesses or evidence to be introduced into the trial outside of what the Democrat-controlled House already presented.          Schumer’s remarks contradict his past statements on the issue when he said that it made no sense for the Senate to call witnesses to testify when they were not called by the House.          Politico added, “Hawley would also seek communications among the whistleblower, Schiff and his staff, transcripts of [Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael] Atkinson’s congressional testimony, communications between the House impeachment managers and Democratic presidential candidates as well as documents related to Biden’s drive to oust former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin.”          Republicans kicked off their defense of Trump on Saturday in the Senate with deputy White House counsel Michael Purpura laying out the following six points that are going to be the outline of Trump’s defense:     • “The transcript shows that the president did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything. The paused security assistance funds aren’t even mentioned on the call.”     • “President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said that there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on them to review anything.”     • “President Zelensky and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did not even know, did not even know, the security assistance was paused until the end of August, over a month after the July 25 call.”     • “Not a single witness testified that the President himself said that there was any connection between any investigations and security assistance, a presidential meeting, or anything else.”     • “The security assistance flowed on September 11 and a presidential meeting took place on September 25 without the Ukrainian government announcing any investigations.”     • “The Democrats blind drive to impeach the president does not and cannot change the fact, as attested to by the Democrats own witnesses, that President Trump has been a better friend and stronger supporter of Ukraine than his predecessor.”          This report has been updated to include additional information.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Marco Rubio Hits Left's ‘Stupid’ Impeachment Games</td>\n",
       "      <td>Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) blasted Democrats’ “stupid” impeachment games on Thursday and asserted that the Senate has “no duty” to go beyond the impeachment witnesses who testified before House lawmakers.          “A Senate trial will be on the two Articles of Impeachment passed by House (if Speaker ever decides to send them over),” he continued, noting that the House voted on the articles “based on testimony of certain witnesses.”          Because of that, the “Senate has no duty to go beyond those witnesses in our trial,” Rubio concluded:          While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) had what McConnell described as a “cordial” conversation on the parameters of the looming impeachment trial prior to the new year, they did not settle their differences on how to proceed. Schumer has not relented on his demand for witnesses, particularly Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton.          “He [Schumer] wants to volunteer the Senate’s time and energy on a fishing expedition to see whether his own ideas could make Chairman Schiff’s sloppy work more persuasive than Chairman Schiff himself bothered to make it,” McConnell stated in December.          So, madame president, this concept is dead wrong. The Senate is meant to act as judge and jury to hear a trial, not to rerun the entire fact-finding investigation because angry partisans rushed sloppily through it. The trajectory that the Democratic leader apparently wants to take us down or before he’s even heard opening arguments could set a nightmare nightmarish precedent for our institution.          However, McConnell did not shut the door on impeachment witnesses altogether.          “We haven’t ruled out witnesses,” McConnell told Fox &amp; Friends in December. “We’ve said, ‘Let’s handle this case just like we did with President Clinton.’”          Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) concurred, telling Maine Public Radio on Monday that she is also open to calling witnesses.          “I am open to witnesses,” she confirmed.          “I think it’s premature to decide who should be called until we see the evidence that is presented and get the answers to the questions that we senators can submit through the Chief Justice to both sides,” she added.</td>\n",

The Senate will hold the final vote Wednesday on the two articles of impeachment.          The motion failed by a vote of 49 to 51. Democrats failed to convince four Republicans to join them in voting to allow new evidence, with just two GOP lawmakers — Senators Susan Collins and Mitt Romney — crossing the aisle.          The Senate adjourned Friday around 8 p.m. and will reconvene Monday at 11 a.m. The Senate approved Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's timeline for the rest of the trial: Closing arguments will be Monday, senators will give speeches Monday through Wednesday and the final vote will occur Wednesday.          Earlier in the day, Republicans and the president's legal team argued the introduction of new witnesses and documents would prolong the trial for weeks or months.          They also warned the move would set a precedent of the Senate conducting its own impeachment investigation, arguing the House should have exhausted its options to compel testimony before impeaching the president. Some Republicans conceded the president acted improperly by pressuring Ukraine, but said removing him from office would lead to more frequent and more partisan impeachment proceedings.          \"If this shallow, hurried and wholly partisan impeachment were to succeed, it would rip the country apart, pouring gasoline on the fire of cultural divisions that already exist,\" Senator Lamar Alexander, one of the Republicans who was on the fence, said in a statement Thursday. \"It would create the weapon of perpetual impeachment to be used against future presidents whenever the House of Representatives is of a different political party.\"          The House managers, however, warned that failing to pursue new testimony from officials like former national security adviser John Bolton would set a \"very dangerous and long-lasting precedent\" that would \"nullify\" Congress' impeachment power.          \"This will set a new precedent. This will be cited in impeachment trials from this point until the end of history,\" Schiff said. \"You can bet that in every impeachment that follows, whether it's a presidential impeachment or the impeachment of a judge, if that judge or president believes that it is to his or her advantage that there will be a trial with no witnesses, they will cite the case of Donald J. Trump.\"          New revelations by former national security adviser John Bolton hung over Friday's vote and served to punctuate Democrats' arguments. The Senate reconvened just after The New York Times reported new details from a manuscript of Bolton's upcoming book.          Bolton writes, according to The Times, that the president instructed him to call the president of Ukraine and tell him to meet with Rudy Giuliani in May 2019. Bolton's reported account is the earliest indication of the president's direct involvement in the campaign to get Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

Biden was asked about the deal during a campaign stop in Iowa, and while he admitted that the issue wasn’t “irrational” he claimed Trump’s trial centered around a “Constitutional issue,” rather than one involving his and his son’s work in Ukraine. Testifying in front of the Senate, Biden added, would turn the trial into “some kind of farce or political theater,” as if it wasn’t already headed in that direction.          Ultimately, Biden says, he wants “no part” of any deal that would require he testify so that a White House official would also take the stand.          Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz floated the idea initially but, according to reports that surfaced yesterday, a group of Senate Democrats were seriously considering a testimony trade just so that Senate Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, would cave to the idea of hosting some witness testimony during the Senate impeachment trial.          Democrats have been desperate to find some way to get witnesses on the Senate floor, ostensibly to help close holes left in the Democrats’ case against the president from the House impeachment inquiry. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) tried, valiantly, to force McConnell to welcome testimony by withholding the articles of impeachment from the Senate, but even moderate Republicans, who were the deciding factor, said they’d prefer the case be set out in full by the Senate impeachment managers.          On Tuesday, in a vote that came near midnight, the Senate voted against allowing witness testimony during the first part of Trump’s Senate trial, but several Senators — including those same moderate Republicans — reserved the right to reverse their vote if, after the two sides present their opening arguments, questions remained about the president’s behavior.          Tuesday night, Democrats met in secret to discuss the Biden for Bolton trade (though, at the time, it wasn’t clear whether they would have given up Joe Biden or his son Hunter, whose involvement in Ukrainian oil and gas company, Burisma, is at the center of what Democrats claim is a “quid-pro-quo” agreement between Trump and the Ukrainian government, foreign aid in return for an investigation into both Bidens’ roles in how Burisma was treated by Ukrainian prosecutors back during the Obama Administration.          Democrats in charge of the trial seemed reticent to ink the deal and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), one of the House’s seven “impeachment managers,” openly decried the issue, calling it “irrelevant.” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), a key “Resistance” figure in Congress added that Hunter Biden’s testimony would be “irrelevant,” and that only Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney would need to testify.          If the Senate does vote to allow witnesses, it will be up to Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, to determine which witnesses are “relevant” to the task at hand.\n",
       "800                                       Your Guide To What Happens Next With Impeachment  Now that they’ve passed an impeachment bill, Democrats are slow-walking the process in a bid to secure procedural guarantees from Senate Republicans on how the trial will unfold.          Now that the House of Representatives has voted to impeach President Trump, action shifts to the Senate, whose members are charged by the Constitution to determine whether he should be convicted or acquitted. Yet wary Democrats are slow-walking the process in a bid to secure procedural guarantees from Senate Republicans on how the trial will unfold.          The House must first appoint members who will manage its case during the trial. When that happens, the House can notify the Senate of its decision to impeach the president and appoint managers.          According to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House will refrain from appointing managers until Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., agree on the ground rules that will govern the trial. At issue are whether the Senate will call additional witnesses and how long the trial will last.          Schumer wants the Senate to call particular witnesses (namely those who refused to testify during the House’s impeachment inquiry). But McConnell doesn’t think witnesses are needed and wants the trial wrapped up quickly.          Notwithstanding the McConnell-Schumer impasse, the House’s decision to appoint managers and notify the Senate is a major development. It formally begins the impeachment process under the Senate’s existing rules and practices. The Senate’s “Rules of Procedure When Sitting On Impeachment Trials” (i.e., the Impeachment Rules) stipulate clearly that senators must consider articles of impeachment once they arrive from the House. In short, the Senate must hold a trial; senators must act.          According to Rule II of the Impeachment Rules, proceedings begin as soon as the House managers arrive at “the bar of the Senate” to exhibit their articles of impeachment against President Trump. After the presentation of the articles, the rules stipulate that the presiding officer informs the House managers that the Senate will notify the House when it has organized for trial. The House managers then leave the Senate.          After the withdrawal of the House managers, the impeachment rules require it to organize for the trial. The first order of business under Rule III is the need to administer oaths to senators and their presiding officer.          The Constitution (Article I, section 3, clause 6) requires the chief justice of the United States to preside in a presidential impeachment trial such as this one. In that case, Rule IV details the procedures that senators follow to administer the oaths. Specifically, the presiding officer first administers the oath mentioned above to the chief justice. The chief justice then administers the oath to senators, en bloc.          After the administration of oaths, the impeachment rules stipulate that the chief justice instructs the sergeant at arms to announce the beginning of the trial. Rule III requires the Senate to remain in session “from day to day…after the trial shall commence (unless otherwise ordered by the Senate) until final judgment shall be rendered” (Sundays excepted).          “Unless otherwise ordered by the Senate” underscores the fact that senators can adopt a different trial schedule by passing a resolution to that effect. Senators may also suspend the impeachment trial by unanimous consent to consider legislative and executive business.          Under Rule VIII, senators must issue a writ of summons setting the date on which the president must respond to the accusations against him. (The Senate also sets the date on which the House managers respond to the president’s response.) Rule XXV even prescribes the text of the summons.          Under the Senate’s regular rules (i.e., its “Standing Rules”), senators could filibuster the writ of summons. But under its impeachment rules, such dilatory tactics are prohibited to ensure that the trial is not delayed and that a verdict is reached. Rule XXIV stipulates that “all the orders and decisions may be acted upon without objection” during the trial. If senators object, “the orders and decisions shall be voted on without debate by yeas and nays….subject to the operation of Rule VII.”          Rule VII requires the presiding officer to “direct all the forms of proceedings while the Senate is sitting for the purpose of trying an impeachment.” In that capacity, senators expect the presiding officer to rule on questions of evidence (i.e., issues of relevancy, materiality, redundancy) and any “incidental questions” that may arise during the trial.          The presiding officer may rule when presented with such questions, or he may submit them directly to the Senate to be decided. If the presiding officer does rule on a question raised during the trial, any senator may appeal it and ask for a “formal vote.”          Regardless of how questions are decided, the impeachment rules prohibit debate. That means the Senate votes immediately whenever questions arise during a trial, and the side with more votes (i.e., a simple majority) wins.          While the Senate’s impeachment rules permit limited debate during closed sessions, senators are allowed only one speech each in such circumstances under the provisions of Rule XXIV. The rule also caps speeches on “interlocutory questions” at ten minutes.          The Senate may adopt supplementary rules to structure impeachment proceedings. During the 1999 Bill Clinton impeachment trial, senators approved two supplementary rules packages (S. Res. 16 and S. Res. 30). S. Res. 16 set the dates by which the president was required to respond to the articles of impeachment and by which the House managers were required to respond to the president’s response. It also set aside a 16-hour block of time for senators to question the parties.          Res. 30 authorized the deposition of particular witnesses and delegated to the majority and minority leaders the power to determine the deposition time for all witnesses. The resolution also empowered House managers and the president’s counsel to make a motion to resolve any objections made during the depositions after a short review period.          Democrats and Republicans alike cite the Clinton procedures as a model for what the Senate should do today. Schumer references them in a letter he sent McConnell outlining his proposal on how the trial should proceed.          McConnell appears to agree with Schumer when it comes to the benefits of the structured approach adopted by the Senate in 1999, stating that “the basic procedural framework of the Clinton impeachment trial served the Senate and the nation well, in my view…I still believe the Senate should try to follow the 1999 model.”          This agreement between McConnell and Schumer on the basic need for supplementary rules suggests that a package is likely to be approved when the Senate reconvenes after the holidays, with or without naming particular witnesses. In the unlikely event that the McConnell-Schumer talks break down, the fact that the Senate has 26 rules and a substantial body of precedents to govern its proceedings when sitting as a court of impeachment suggests that it will be able to conduct the trial.\n",

Josh Hawley (R-SC), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has drafted motions to subpoena Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, his son, Hunter Biden, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), and the Ukraine whistleblower.          “The Missouri Republican is preparing to file subpoena requests for witnesses and documents that Democrats and Republicans alike won’t want to vote on, a tactic intended to convince a handful of senators to sink a vote next week to consider new evidence in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial,” Politico reported. “Hawley’s strategy harmonizes with plans from GOP Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky to force votes to hear from Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son who was on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.”          On Twitter, Hawley wrote, “I have drafted motions to subpoena Adam Schiff, the ‘whistleblower,’ Hunter Biden, and Joe Biden to testify. If the Senate calls witnesses, I will ask for votes on all these next week.”          Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has sought to create a narrative that Senate Republicans are engaged in a cover-up because they are not allowing additional witnesses or evidence to be introduced into the trial outside of what the Democrat-controlled House already presented.          Schumer’s remarks contradict his past statements on the issue when he said that it made no sense for the Senate to call witnesses to testify when they were not called by the House.          Politico added, “Hawley would also seek communications among the whistleblower, Schiff and his staff, transcripts of [Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael] Atkinson’s congressional testimony, communications between the House impeachment managers and Democratic presidential candidates as well as documents related to Biden’s drive to oust former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin.”          Republicans kicked off their defense of Trump on Saturday in the Senate with deputy White House counsel Michael Purpura laying out the following six points that are going to be the outline of Trump’s defense:     • “The transcript shows that the president did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything. The paused security assistance funds aren’t even mentioned on the call.”     • “President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said that there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on them to review anything.”     • “President Zelensky and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did not even know, did not even know, the security assistance was paused until the end of August, over a month after the July 25 call.”     • “Not a single witness testified that the President himself said that there was any connection between any investigations and security assistance, a presidential meeting, or anything else.”     • “The security assistance flowed on September 11 and a presidential meeting took place on September 25 without the Ukrainian government announcing any investigations.”     • “The Democrats blind drive to impeach the president does not and cannot change the fact, as attested to by the Democrats own witnesses, that President Trump has been a better friend and stronger supporter of Ukraine than his predecessor.”          This report has been updated to include additional information.\n",

Marco Rubio (R-FL) blasted Democrats’ “stupid” impeachment games on Thursday and asserted that the Senate has “no duty” to go beyond the impeachment witnesses who testified before House lawmakers.          “A Senate trial will be on the two Articles of Impeachment passed by House (if Speaker ever decides to send them over),” he continued, noting that the House voted on the articles “based on testimony of certain witnesses.”          Because of that, the “Senate has no duty to go beyond those witnesses in our trial,” Rubio concluded:          While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) had what McConnell described as a “cordial” conversation on the parameters of the looming impeachment trial prior to the new year, they did not settle their differences on how to proceed. Schumer has not relented on his demand for witnesses, particularly Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton.          “He [Schumer] wants to volunteer the Senate’s time and energy on a fishing expedition to see whether his own ideas could make Chairman Schiff’s sloppy work more persuasive than Chairman Schiff himself bothered to make it,” McConnell stated in December.          So, madame president, this concept is dead wrong. The Senate is meant to act as judge and jury to hear a trial, not to rerun the entire fact-finding investigation because angry partisans rushed sloppily through it. The trajectory that the Democratic leader apparently wants to take us down or before he’s even heard opening arguments could set a nightmare nightmarish precedent for our institution.          However, McConnell did not shut the door on impeachment witnesses altogether.          “We haven’t ruled out witnesses,” McConnell told Fox & Friends in December. “We’ve said, ‘Let’s handle this case just like we did with President Clinton.’”          Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) concurred, telling Maine Public Radio on Monday that she is also open to calling witnesses.          “I am open to witnesses,” she confirmed.          “I think it’s premature to decide who should be called until we see the evidence that is presented and get the answers to the questions that we senators can submit through the Chief Justice to both sides,” she added."

       "      <td>A poll released by Emerson College on Tuesday shows presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s lead over President Donald Trump has slipped to three points in the key battleground state of Minnesota.          The Emerson College poll of 733 likely registered voters in Minnesota was conducted between August 8 and 10, and has a margin of error of 3.6 percent, which means the contest between Biden and Trump in the state is currently a statistical tie.          The poll results continue the trend of momentum at both the national and battleground state level in the direction of President Trump, who has significantly narrowed the gap against Biden over the past three weeks.          President Trump narrowly lost Minnesota and its ten electoral college votes in the 2016 presidential election, garnering just 44,000 fewer votes than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.          Minnesota is ground zero of the Black Lives Matter inspired riots and protests that have swept the country since the death of George Floyd during his arrest by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department in May.          A new Emerson College Poll finds Minnesota is competitive again in 2020, with 50% of voters planning on supporting former VP Joe Biden and 47% intending to vote for President Trump. While the race is close, only 3% of voters remain undecided. Of voters who plan to vote by mail, 91% plan to vote for Biden, and of those who plan to vote in person, 68% plan to vote for Trump. President Trump’s approval rating amongst Minnesota voters is slightly underwater, with 46% approval, and 51% disapprove of his job performance, with 3% remaining neutral. Among independent voters, Trump’s approval is at 45% approval, and 47% disapproval. First-term Governor Tim Walz has a more favorable view, with 50% approving of his job performance, 41% disapproving and 9% holding a neutral opinion on the Governor.          The poll also found that incumbent Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) leads former Congressman Jason Lewis (R-MN), who won the Republican primary on Tuesday, by a similar three point margin, 48 percent to 45 percent, which is within the poll’s margin of error.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont holds a 12-point lead over his nearest 2020 Democratic presidential rival in New Hampshire, according to a WBUR poll released on Thursday.          Mr. Sanders was the top choice of 29% of likely Democratic primary voters, followed by Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, at 17%, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden at 14%, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 13%, according to the poll.          “I wouldn’t take these numbers to the bank,” said Steve Koczela, president of the MassINC Polling Group, which conducted the poll. “But you’ve got to be feeling pretty good about where you stand right at this moment if you’re the Sanders campaign.”          Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota was next at 6%, followed by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 5% apiece. No other candidate topped 2% support.          In a WBUR poll released in December, Mr. Buttigieg had been in the lead with 18% support, followed by Mr. Biden at 17%, Mr. Sanders at 15% and Ms. Warren at 12%.          Mr. Sanders cruised to victory in New Hampshire in 2016 over Hillary Clinton, the eventual Democratic presidential nominee who went on to lose to President Trump in the general election.          The survey of 426 likely primary voters was taken from Jan. 17-21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This article has been updated to include the latest information. We’re just 100 days out from learning if we’ll see four more years of the most unexpected, unorthodox and unpredictable presidency in American history, or the last-shot victory of a career politician who will beat by almost a decade Trump’s record of being the oldest man to ever take the office. According to most of the national and state pollsters — about whom Americans have justifiably developed a healthy skepticism — the 77-year-old “Sleepy Joe” is on cruise control to finally bag the biggest prize in the world after two previous failed attempts. Working against Trump is the compounding effect of the nation’s two simultaneous crises: COVID-19 and widespread racial unrest, or as The New York Times’ Nikole Hannah-Jones says she’d be “honored” to call them, the “1619 Riots.” But there are some slight glimmers of hope for Trump buried in some of the data. According to RealClearPolitics’ average of the national polls, Trump has never led Biden in a head-to-head. For most of 2020, through mid-March, the gap between the two has been around 5%. But as the pandemic lockdowns began, the divide roughly doubled, reaching its peak of 10.2% on June 23, by which point the George Floyd-sparked protests and riots were in full swing. The gap has slightly diminished since but remains formidable. The most recent average of the polls finds Trump trailing Biden by 8.7 points (49.6–40.9), roughly the same as last week (8.6) and about a point better than late June. Two of three polls updated since last week found the gap between the candidates shrinking. YouGov’s poll conducted July 19-21 found Biden ahead by 7, a two-point decline since the previous week. Rasmussen also tracked a slight closing of the gap from 3 to 2 points from a week before. The Hill found the opposite, Biden building on his lead by 3 points to +7 from its previous survey results. While, as usual, Rasmussen gives Trump the best shot at a repeat of 2016 — in which he trailed Hillary Clinton by 3.3%, ended up losing the popular vote by 2.1%, but went on to easily defeat her in the Electoral College — Quinnipiac’s widely reported poll from last week found Trump trailing by a dismal 15 points. Both polls appear to be outliers, however, with multiple polls finding the gap to be between 7 to 10 points. Here is the breakdown from some of the major national polls that factor into the average, with the most recent at the top:     • The Hill — Biden +7 (45–38) was Biden +4 last week          Will Biden’s lead erode as so often happens as the election approaches? The Trump-critical New York Times says it may not. “The last time a candidate sustained such a large advantage for so long was nearly 25 years ago, when Bill Clinton led Bob Dole in 1996,” the Times noted this week. While the national polls can be helpful in trying to gauge widespread public sentiment and momentum, the election, of course, isn’t decided by the popular vote — the data that matters the most comes from the states. The problem is, as 2016 demonstrated, state polling is often more inaccurate due to less thorough information. Despite losing the popular vote by about 2%, Trump ultimately trounced Clinton in several key swing states, allowing him to rack up 304 electoral votes to her 227. Heading into election day, the state polls indicated that he’d lose by 6 electoral votes. Currently, Trump’s outlook on the state level isn’t good. In order to shock the world again, he’ll need many of the state polls to be wrong again. Here’s the current breakdown of key battleground states, according to RCP’s averages:     • Arizona — Biden +2.8 (same as last month) — 2016: Trump won by 3.6     • Florida — Biden +7 (up from +3.4) — 2016: Trump won by 1.2     • Iowa — Trump +1.5 (down from +4.6) — 2016: Trump won by 9.4     • Michigan — Biden +8.2 (up from +4.2) — 2016: Trump won by 0.2     • North Carolina — Biden +2 (up from +0.8) — 2016: Trump won by 3.6     • Pennsylvania — Biden +6.7 (up from +4) — 2016: Trump won by 1.7     • Texas — Trump +0.2 (down from +2.2) — 2016: Trump won by 9     • Wisconsin — Biden +5.5 (up from +3.4) — 2016: Trump won by 0.7          If Biden were to hold on to the states Clinton won in 2016 and win the states above in which he currently leads by 3% or more (FL, MI, PA and WI), he would secure 71 votes more than Clinton (25, 16, 20, and 10, respectively). Those 71 votes would win the election for Biden with about 30 votes to spare. For those looking for hope for Trump, here’s a postmortem on how much the state pollsters botched the 2016 election. Below is how the Electoral College map is shaping up 14 weeks out:          The betting odds have been trending in the same direction as the polls since the lockdowns: Biden gaining at Trump’s expense. Action Network gives Biden a 59.7% chance of winning and Trump 33.2%. Here’s the bettors’ odds including some longshot candidates, among them Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson — and Clinton, of course:          This article has been updated and expanded to include additional recent and relevant information.

       "      <td>(medianame) Poll of the week: A new medianame/SSRS poll finds that former Vice President Joe Biden leads in the state of Florida by a 51% to 46% margin over President Donald Trump among registered voters.          The fact that the polls in Florida favor Biden should be one of the biggest warning signs yet for Trump's fledgling campaign. Yes, we still have 100 days to go, and history does suggest that the gap in Florida could close.          Still, Florida is probably the bellwether state that most meets the definition of \"must win\" for Trump if he wants to be elected to a second term, and he is losing there.          Moreover, it's a state that leans a little bit to the right of the nation. The last time the state voted more Democratic than the nation as a whole in a presidential election was 1976. The fact that Trump is down here by an average of 8 points in high quality live interview polls since June 1 suggests he is down significantly nationally.          Biden, on the other hand, has a clear path to 270 electoral votes without Florida. Biden has held 6 to 12 point leads in polls released this week from Michigan and Pennsylvania. This includes 6 point and 12 point advantages in Michigan from CBS News/YouGov and medianame/SSRS polls respectively released on Sunday. High quality polls from June gave Biden an average 10-point lead in Wisconsin . If Biden adds all of those states to his column plus the 232 electoral votes from the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, he gets to 278 electoral votes.          Winning Florida gives Biden a lot of backup options given that it's worth 29 electoral votes. If Biden adds the 29 electoral votes from Florida to the states Clinton took in 2016, he gets 261 electoral votes. Biden would need just 9 electoral votes more to get an electoral college majority. He could add any other state that Trump won in 2016 by 9.0 points or less.          As I noted a few months ago , Florida is geographically and demographically diverse from the Great Lake battleground states. If Biden stumbles in the mostly White Great Lake swing states, he could conceivably hold onto Florida and add on the diverse swing state of Arizona. Biden has consistently been ahead in Arizona, and he was up 4 and 5 points in the latest medianame/SSRS and NBC News/Marist College polls out Sunday.          Additionally, Biden could just win one of those Great Lake battleground states and Florida to get to 270 electoral votes. Biden could, for example, add Michigan (16 electoral votes) to his column, and it would be enough. Biden has held the advantage in every single nonpartisan poll in Michigan since early March          every Perhaps as importantly for Democrats, the polling in Florida has generally been accurate at the end of the campaign. There hasn't been an error like there was in the Great Lakes in 2016. The final Florida polls from medianame have been within 3 points of the outcome in presidential election since 2008. The same holds true for the gubernatorial and Senate elections in 2018          With Biden's polling lead being as wide as it is right now in the Sunshine State, the past accuracy of the final polls suggest he really is ahead right now.          The good news for Trump is that history does indicate how difficult it would be for Biden to win the state by a large margin. The last time a Democrat won the state by more than 6 points was 1948 . No candidate from either party has won the state by more than 6 points since 1992.          Overall the point is that we shouldn't be surprised if the margin in Florida closes down the stretch. That's exactly what happened in the 2018 midterms, when Republican candidates for governor and Senate squeaked out wins by less than a point.          As I've said many times before, Trump likely can't win if he doesn't turn around his low approval ratings on the coronavirus. His approval rating in Florida on the issue is just 42% among registered voters in the latest medianame poll.</td>\n",

The Emerson College poll of 733 likely registered voters in Minnesota was conducted between August 8 and 10, and has a margin of error of 3.6 percent, which means the contest between Biden and Trump in the state is currently a statistical tie.          The poll results continue the trend of momentum at both the national and battleground state level in the direction of President Trump, who has significantly narrowed the gap against Biden over the past three weeks.          President Trump narrowly lost Minnesota and its ten electoral college votes in the 2016 presidential election, garnering just 44,000 fewer votes than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.          Minnesota is ground zero of the Black Lives Matter inspired riots and protests that have swept the country since the death of George Floyd during his arrest by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department in May.          A new Emerson College Poll finds Minnesota is competitive again in 2020, with 50% of voters planning on supporting former VP Joe Biden and 47% intending to vote for President Trump. While the race is close, only 3% of voters remain undecided. Of voters who plan to vote by mail, 91% plan to vote for Biden, and of those who plan to vote in person, 68% plan to vote for Trump. President Trump’s approval rating amongst Minnesota voters is slightly underwater, with 46% approval, and 51% disapprove of his job performance, with 3% remaining neutral. Among independent voters, Trump’s approval is at 45% approval, and 47% disapproval. First-term Governor Tim Walz has a more favorable view, with 50% approving of his job performance, 41% disapproving and 9% holding a neutral opinion on the Governor.          The poll also found that incumbent Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) leads former Congressman Jason Lewis (R-MN), who won the Republican primary on Tuesday, by a similar three point margin, 48 percent to 45 percent, which is within the poll’s margin of error.\n",

Bernard Sanders of Vermont holds a 12-point lead over his nearest 2020 Democratic presidential rival in New Hampshire, according to a WBUR poll released on Thursday.          Mr. Sanders was the top choice of 29% of likely Democratic primary voters, followed by Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, at 17%, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden at 14%, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 13%, according to the poll.          “I wouldn’t take these numbers to the bank,” said Steve Koczela, president of the MassINC Polling Group, which conducted the poll. “But you’ve got to be feeling pretty good about where you stand right at this moment if you’re the Sanders campaign.”          Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota was next at 6%, followed by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 5% apiece. No other candidate topped 2% support.          In a WBUR poll released in December, Mr. Buttigieg had been in the lead with 18% support, followed by Mr. Biden at 17%, Mr. Sanders at 15% and Ms. Warren at 12%.          Mr. Sanders cruised to victory in New Hampshire in 2016 over Hillary Clinton, the eventual Democratic presidential nominee who went on to lose to President Trump in the general election.          The survey of 426 likely primary voters was taken from Jan. 17-21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.\n",
       "311                                                Trump Vs. Biden: All The Latest Polls  This article has been updated to include the latest information. We’re just 100 days out from learning if we’ll see four more years of the most unexpected, unorthodox and unpredictable presidency in American history, or the last-shot victory of a career politician who will beat by almost a decade Trump’s record of being the oldest man to ever take the office. According to most of the national and state pollsters — about whom Americans have justifiably developed a healthy skepticism — the 77-year-old “Sleepy Joe” is on cruise control to finally bag the biggest prize in the world after two previous failed attempts. Working against Trump is the compounding effect of the nation’s two simultaneous crises: COVID-19 and widespread racial unrest, or as The New York Times’ Nikole Hannah-Jones says she’d be “honored” to call them, the “1619 Riots.” But there are some slight glimmers of hope for Trump buried in some of the data. According to RealClearPolitics’ average of the national polls, Trump has never led Biden in a head-to-head. For most of 2020, through mid-March, the gap between the two has been around 5%. But as the pandemic lockdowns began, the divide roughly doubled, reaching its peak of 10.2% on June 23, by which point the George Floyd-sparked protests and riots were in full swing. The gap has slightly diminished since but remains formidable. The most recent average of the polls finds Trump trailing Biden by 8.7 points (49.6–40.9), roughly the same as last week (8.6) and about a point better than late June. Two of three polls updated since last week found the gap between the candidates shrinking. YouGov’s poll conducted July 19-21 found Biden ahead by 7, a two-point decline since the previous week. Rasmussen also tracked a slight closing of the gap from 3 to 2 points from a week before. The Hill found the opposite, Biden building on his lead by 3 points to +7 from its previous survey results. While, as usual, Rasmussen gives Trump the best shot at a repeat of 2016 — in which he trailed Hillary Clinton by 3.3%, ended up losing the popular vote by 2.1%, but went on to easily defeat her in the Electoral College — Quinnipiac’s widely reported poll from last week found Trump trailing by a dismal 15 points. Both polls appear to be outliers, however, with multiple polls finding the gap to be between 7 to 10 points. Here is the breakdown from some of the major national polls that factor into the average, with the most recent at the top:     • The Hill — Biden +7 (45–38) was Biden +4 last week          Will Biden’s lead erode as so often happens as the election approaches? The Trump-critical New York Times says it may not. “The last time a candidate sustained such a large advantage for so long was nearly 25 years ago, when Bill Clinton led Bob Dole in 1996,” the Times noted this week. While the national polls can be helpful in trying to gauge widespread public sentiment and momentum, the election, of course, isn’t decided by the popular vote — the data that matters the most comes from the states. The problem is, as 2016 demonstrated, state polling is often more inaccurate due to less thorough information. Despite losing the popular vote by about 2%, Trump ultimately trounced Clinton in several key swing states, allowing him to rack up 304 electoral votes to her 227. Heading into election day, the state polls indicated that he’d lose by 6 electoral votes. Currently, Trump’s outlook on the state level isn’t good. In order to shock the world again, he’ll need many of the state polls to be wrong again. Here’s the current breakdown of key battleground states, according to RCP’s averages:     • Arizona — Biden +2.8 (same as last month) — 2016: Trump won by 3.6     • Florida — Biden +7 (up from +3.4) — 2016: Trump won by 1.2     • Iowa — Trump +1.5 (down from +4.6) — 2016: Trump won by 9.4     • Michigan — Biden +8.2 (up from +4.2) — 2016: Trump won by 0.2     • North Carolina — Biden +2 (up from +0.8) — 2016: Trump won by 3.6     • Pennsylvania — Biden +6.7 (up from +4) — 2016: Trump won by 1.7     • Texas — Trump +0.2 (down from +2.2) — 2016: Trump won by 9     • Wisconsin — Biden +5.5 (up from +3.4) — 2016: Trump won by 0.7          If Biden were to hold on to the states Clinton won in 2016 and win the states above in which he currently leads by 3% or more (FL, MI, PA and WI), he would secure 71 votes more than Clinton (25, 16, 20, and 10, respectively). Those 71 votes would win the election for Biden with about 30 votes to spare. For those looking for hope for Trump, here’s a postmortem on how much the state pollsters botched the 2016 election. Below is how the Electoral College map is shaping up 14 weeks out:          The betting odds have been trending in the same direction as the polls since the lockdowns: Biden gaining at Trump’s expense. Action Network gives Biden a 59.7% chance of winning and Trump 33.2%. Here’s the bettors’ odds including some longshot candidates, among them Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson — and Clinton, of course:          This article has been updated and expanded to include additional recent and relevant information.

       "648  Trump is behind in a state no Republican has won the presidency without in 96 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        (medianame) Poll of the week: A new medianame/SSRS poll finds that former Vice President Joe Biden leads in the state of Florida by a 51% to 46% margin over President Donald Trump among registered voters.          The fact that the polls in Florida favor Biden should be one of the biggest warning signs yet for Trump's fledgling campaign. Yes, we still have 100 days to go, and history does suggest that the gap in Florida could close.          Still, Florida is probably the bellwether state that most meets the definition of \"must win\" for Trump if he wants to be elected to a second term, and he is losing there.          Moreover, it's a state that leans a little bit to the right of the nation. The last time the state voted more Democratic than the nation as a whole in a presidential election was 1976. The fact that Trump is down here by an average of 8 points in high quality live interview polls since June 1 suggests he is down significantly nationally.          Biden, on the other hand, has a clear path to 270 electoral votes without Florida. Biden has held 6 to 12 point leads in polls released this week from Michigan and Pennsylvania. This includes 6 point and 12 point advantages in Michigan from CBS News/YouGov and medianame/SSRS polls respectively released on Sunday. High quality polls from June gave Biden an average 10-point lead in Wisconsin . If Biden adds all of those states to his column plus the 232 electoral votes from the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, he gets to 278 electoral votes.          Winning Florida gives Biden a lot of backup options given that it's worth 29 electoral votes. If Biden adds the 29 electoral votes from Florida to the states Clinton took in 2016, he gets 261 electoral votes. Biden would need just 9 electoral votes more to get an electoral college majority. He could add any other state that Trump won in 2016 by 9.0 points or less.          As I noted a few months ago , Florida is geographically and demographically diverse from the Great Lake battleground states. If Biden stumbles in the mostly White Great Lake swing states, he could conceivably hold onto Florida and add on the diverse swing state of Arizona. Biden has consistently been ahead in Arizona, and he was up 4 and 5 points in the latest medianame/SSRS and NBC News/Marist College polls out Sunday.          Additionally, Biden could just win one of those Great Lake battleground states and Florida to get to 270 electoral votes. Biden could, for example, add Michigan (16 electoral votes) to his column, and it would be enough. Biden has held the advantage in every single nonpartisan poll in Michigan since early March          every Perhaps as importantly for Democrats, the polling in Florida has generally been accurate at the end of the campaign. There hasn't been an error like there was in the Great Lakes in 2016. The final Florida polls from medianame have been within 3 points of the outcome in presidential election since 2008. The same holds true for the gubernatorial and Senate elections in 2018          With Biden's polling lead being as wide as it is right now in the Sunshine State, the past accuracy of the final polls suggest he really is ahead right now.          The good news for Trump is that history does indicate how difficult it would be for Biden to win the state by a large margin. The last time a Democrat won the state by more than 6 points was 1948 . No candidate from either party has won the state by more than 6 points since 1992.          Overall the point is that we shouldn't be surprised if the margin in Florida closes down the stretch. That's exactly what happened in the 2018 midterms, when Republican candidates for governor and Senate squeaked out wins by less than a point.          As I've said many times before, Trump likely can't win if he doesn't turn around his low approval ratings on the coronavirus. His approval rating in Florida on the issue is just 42% among registered voters in the latest medianame poll.\n",

The latest Fox News poll, however, showed the two candidates tied at 42% each. * In a clear indication that the Biden campaign is trying to expand its appeal to Bernie Sanders' supporters, the former vice president added progressive ideas to his platform yesterday, announcing proposals to lower the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 60, while also endorsing student-debt forgiveness for many low- and middle-income families. * For his part, Sanders told medianame's Chris Hayes last night that he believes the former vice president recognizes the need to build support among the senator's backers. The Vermonter described Biden's new proposals as steps in the \"right direction.\" * In New Hampshire yesterday, a state judge rejected a Republican-backed law that made it more difficult for students to register to vote, calling the policy \"unconstitutional,\" \"discriminatory\" and \"unreasonable.\" * Speaking of the Granite State, Gov. Chris Sununu (R), traditionally a skeptic of widespread absentee voting, announced yesterday that New Hampshire voters will be able to vote by mail in the general election if the coronavirus is still putting the public at risk in the fall. * Nebraska is moving forward with its plans to hold primary elections on May 12, but Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) yesterday encouraged the state's voters to cast ballots via the mail. * And in Georgia, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported yesterday that about 60,000 voters in the state \"recently received absentee ballot request forms with the wrong return mailing or email address.\" The report added that state election officials said absentee ballot requests \"will be delivered to their correct destinations, even if voters send them to the erroneous pre-printed addresses.\""

       "      <td>Donald Trump has claimed Joe Biden is “against God” in an attack on the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate’s faith.          In provocative remarks during a trip to Ohio, a key election battleground, the US president said Biden was “following the radical left agenda”.          Trump added: “Take away your guns, destroy your second amendment. No religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God.          “He’s against God, he’s against guns, he’s against energy, our kind of energy.”          Biden, who is leading in the polls, has frequently spoken about how his Catholic faith helped him cope with the deaths of his first wife and daughter in a 1972 car accident.          In a statement, he said Trump’s comments were “shameful”.          He added: “Like so many people, my faith has been the bedrock foundation of my life: it’s provided me comfort in moments of loss and tragedy, it’s kept me grounded and humbled in times of triumph and joy.          “And in this moment of darkness for our country – of pain, of division, and of sickness for so many Americans – my faith has been a guiding light for me and a constant reminder of the fundamental dignity and humanity that God has bestowed upon all of us.          “For President Trump to attack my faith is shameful. It’s beneath the office he holds and it’s beneath the dignity the American people so rightly expect and deserve from their leaders.”          Biden’s stance on abortion has antagonised many of his fellow Catholics. In 1973, he said the Roe v Wade supreme court decision went “too far”, but now believes Roe v Wade is “the law of the land, a woman has a right to choose”.          Biden is dealing with a controversy of his own, after suggesting the African American community was homogenous – a comment Trump described as “very insulting”.          Biden said: “What you all know but most people don’t know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”          He later tweeted: “Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith – not by identity, not on issues, not at all.          “My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Opinion | A Biden Presidency Could Be Better Than Progressives Think</td>\n",
       "      <td>Biden wouldn’t need to pivot so dramatically to be a transformative progressive president. There are plenty of bleak moments in his record, including his treatment of Anita Hill and his Iraq war vote, but it’s not quite as reactionary as leftists sometimes imagine. Among other things, he’s long been better-than-average on unions; as Jared Bernstein, Biden’s former chief economist, told me, “One of the main things that differentiates Biden from a traditional mainstream Democrat is his understanding of the importance of worker power.”          Still, it’s clear that he’s moving leftward. Biden recently came out for tuition-free college for students whose families earn less than $125,000. He endorsed Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy plan, something that would have been unimaginable in 2005, when Warren, then a Harvard law professor, charged onto the public stage to fight a regressive bankruptcy bill that Biden supported.          After long supporting the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions, Biden gave in to pro-choice pressure to come out against it. His climate plan already went beyond any of Barack Obama’s initiatives, and he’s pledged to make it even more robust. Biden’s health care proposal falls far short of single-payer, but it is, as Paul Waldman wrote in The Washington Post, “surprisingly liberal.”          It will be in Biden’s political interests to try to make good on these commitments. “I’ve worked with him for a while now,” said Jared Bernstein. “He really believes you achieve political success by either doing what you’ve promised to do or getting caught trying like hell.”          In the 20th century, the two presidents with the most substantive records of progressive accomplishment were Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. Liberals nearly revolted on the Democratic convention floor when John F. Kennedy, looking to placate Southern voters, chose Johnson, but he ended up doing far more for liberalism than Kennedy did.          Roosevelt’s future greatness wasn’t obvious to all when he first ran for president. Sounding some of the same notes as Biden’s critics today, the famous political columnist Walter Lippmann wrote: “He is no tribune of the people. He is no enemy of entrenched privilege. He is a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the office, would very much like to be president.”          It may be too much to hope that Biden could equal the achievements of Roosevelt or Johnson. But should he become president, he will, like both of them, inherit a country deep in crisis, where once inconceivable political interventions suddenly appear possible. We can’t know whether he will rise to the opportunity — only that presidencies are shaped by far more than the ideology of the person who achieves the office.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Michigan Gov. Whitmer met with Biden as running mate announcement nears</td>\n",
       "      <td>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer traveled to Delaware last weekend for a private meeting with former Vice President and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, two Democratic officials confirmed to medianame News. News of the meeting was first reported earlier Friday by The Associated Press, which said that the meeting was Biden's first known in-person session with a potential running mate. The meeting lasted several hours, one of the two Democratic officials who confirmed the meeting said. Biden had said he planned to make an announcement the first week in August, but aides later said that was unlikely. Whitmer declined to comment when asked about the meeting. On Thursday, medianame News reported that Whitmer was among those still under serious consideration. Democrats with knowledge of the process have said Whitmer did not recently re-emerge as a potential vice presidential pick but had long remained in Biden’s top tier. Public speculation of a possible pick has also centered around Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., former national security adviser Susan Rice and Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also in the running. Michigan is a battleground state, and President Donald Trump narrowly won it in the 2016 election by around 10,700 votes. Whitmer has earned the respect of Biden officials for her role in responding to the coronavirus pandemic — at times in the face of protests that included demonstrations outside the state capitol building in which some protesters were armed, and a tweet by Trump that read \"Liberate Michigan!\" in capital letters. She elevated her public profile earlier this year by battling with Trump over the federal response to the pandemic. Senior Biden campaign officials have made clear again in recent days that they believe the COVID-19 pandemic combined with Trump’s management of the crisis and the resulting economic fallout is the central issue of the fall campaign.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Biden on Ditching Filibuster: Depends How 'Obstreperous' GOP Becomes</td>\n",
       "      <td>Joe Biden is refusing to rule out scrapping the Senate filibuster, arguing it remains to be seen how “obstreperous” Republicans will be after President Donald Trump leaves office.          The former vice president, who spent a majority of his nearly 40-year political career in the United States Senate, made the remarks on Monday in an interview with several prominent media outlets. Biden, in particular, claimed that while he had “not supported the elimination of the filibuster” in the past, a wait-and-see approach was needed until it was clear how Republicans would act in the post-Trump era.          “I think it’s gonna depend on how obstreperous [Republicans] become,” the former vice president told reporters, as noted by the Washington Post. Biden clarified that he was not necessarily expressing support in one direction or the other. “But I think you’re going to just have to take a look at it.”          The presumptive Democrat nominee added that he was optimistic that his administration would be able to forge a bipartisan consensus among congressional lawmakers, especially if his party were to win the Senate majority.          “I think I have a pretty good record of being able to pull together Democrats and Republicans,” Biden said, further noting that his long tenure in Congress made him “fairly good at understanding what the limitations of a senator [are] and trying to figure out how you help them.”          Biden’s comments on the topic come as a cadre of Democrat lawmakers are in talks to abolish the filibuster, which requires a three-fifths supermajority—usually 60 votes—to end debate on legislation in the Senate. The proposal, still in the early stages, is contingent upon Democrats winning both the White House and the Senate majority this November.          Even though no definitive agreement has been reached, a surprising number of lawmakers, including moderate Democrats, have expressed openness to either discarding or reforming the filibuster in recent weeks. Most notably, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Chris Coons (D-DE) have floated the idea as a way to prevent Republicans from obstructing Biden’s political agenda, provided the presumptive Democrat nominee wins.          “I will not stand idly by for four years and watch the Biden administration’s initiatives blocked at every turn,” Coons, a top congressional ally of the former vice president, said last month.          Progressive Democrats have argued that the filibuster is undemocratic as it allows a minority of lawmakers—at times even only one lawmaker—to hold up legislation favored by a majority of the Senate’s members. As neither party has held a supermajority within the chamber in recent years, bills without broad bipartisan support have gained little traction.          Some progressives, including Biden’s onetime rival and now potential running mate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) favor scrapping the rule in order to advance controversial legislation on topics such as gun control or abortion. Moderates, on the other hand, have defended the filibuster, claiming the limitation it imposed on majority rule was the “entire premise of the Senate” in the first place.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Former Vice President Joe Biden backtracked Saturday after first saying he wouldn’t comply with a Senate subpoena amid President Donald Trump’s trial, noting he would comply with the request.          Biden doubled down Friday on an earlier comment that he would not comply with a possible Senate subpoena. The 2020 presidential candidate tried to clarify his remarks Saturday on Twitter, writing that there would be no “legal basis” for the subpoena.          He later added that he would, in fact, comply if such a request came about, despite originally saying he would reject it.          “I would obey any subpoena that was sent to me,” Biden said Saturday during a town-hall style event in Iowa, the New York Times reported.          Biden’s drastic turn on complying with a subpoena is not the first time he has flip-flopped on an issue. After decades of supporting the death penalty, he tweeted in July that he now wants to “eliminate” it.          Biden also changed his position on the Hyde Amendment after backlash from members of the Democratic party in June. (‘If He’d Take It, Yes’: Biden Open To Nominating Obama For Supreme Court)          The former vice president criticized himself for answering the Senate subpoena question in the first place. He said that “This is going to be the news today” and noted he “shouldn’t even have answered the question.”          “I shouldn’t even have answered the question,” Biden said according to the NYT. “Because in answering the question, now there’s going to be another round.

He added: “Like so many people, my faith has been the bedrock foundation of my life: it’s provided me comfort in moments of loss and tragedy, it’s kept me grounded and humbled in times of triumph and joy.          “And in this moment of darkness for our country – of pain, of division, and of sickness for so many Americans – my faith has been a guiding light for me and a constant reminder of the fundamental dignity and humanity that God has bestowed upon all of us.          “For President Trump to attack my faith is shameful. It’s beneath the office he holds and it’s beneath the dignity the American people so rightly expect and deserve from their leaders.”          Biden’s stance on abortion has antagonised many of his fellow Catholics. In 1973, he said the Roe v Wade supreme court decision went “too far”, but now believes Roe v Wade is “the law of the land, a woman has a right to choose”.          Biden is dealing with a controversy of his own, after suggesting the African American community was homogenous – a comment Trump described as “very insulting”.          Biden said: “What you all know but most people don’t know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things.”          He later tweeted: “Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith – not by identity, not on issues, not at all.          “My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future.”\n",
       "141     Opinion | A Biden Presidency Could Be Better Than Progressives Think                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Biden wouldn’t need to pivot so dramatically to be a transformative progressive president. There are plenty of bleak moments in his record, including his treatment of Anita Hill and his Iraq war vote, but it’s not quite as reactionary as leftists sometimes imagine. Among other things, he’s long been better-than-average on unions; as Jared Bernstein, Biden’s former chief economist, told me, “One of the main things that differentiates Biden from a traditional mainstream Democrat is his understanding of the importance of worker power.”          Still, it’s clear that he’s moving leftward. Biden recently came out for tuition-free college for students whose families earn less than $125,000. He endorsed Elizabeth Warren’s bankruptcy plan, something that would have been unimaginable in 2005, when Warren, then a Harvard law professor, charged onto the public stage to fight a regressive bankruptcy bill that Biden supported.          After long supporting the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions, Biden gave in to pro-choice pressure to come out against it. His climate plan already went beyond any of Barack Obama’s initiatives, and he’s pledged to make it even more robust. Biden’s health care proposal falls far short of single-payer, but it is, as Paul Waldman wrote in The Washington Post, “surprisingly liberal.”          It will be in Biden’s political interests to try to make good on these commitments. “I’ve worked with him for a while now,” said Jared Bernstein. “He really believes you achieve political success by either doing what you’ve promised to do or getting caught trying like hell.”          In the 20th century, the two presidents with the most substantive records of progressive accomplishment were Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. Liberals nearly revolted on the Democratic convention floor when John F. Kennedy, looking to placate Southern voters, chose Johnson, but he ended up doing far more for liberalism than Kennedy did.          Roosevelt’s future greatness wasn’t obvious to all when he first ran for president. Sounding some of the same notes as Biden’s critics today, the famous political columnist Walter Lippmann wrote: “He is no tribune of the people. He is no enemy of entrenched privilege. He is a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the office, would very much like to be president.”          It may be too much to hope that Biden could equal the achievements of Roosevelt or Johnson. But should he become president, he will, like both of them, inherit a country deep in crisis, where once inconceivable political interventions suddenly appear possible. We can’t know whether he will rise to the opportunity — only that presidencies are shaped by far more than the ideology of the person who achieves the office.\n",
       "161  Michigan Gov. Whitmer met with Biden as running mate announcement nears                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer traveled to Delaware last weekend for a private meeting with former Vice President and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, two Democratic officials confirmed to medianame News. News of the meeting was first reported earlier Friday by The Associated Press, which said that the meeting was Biden's first known in-person session with a potential running mate. The meeting lasted several hours, one of the two Democratic officials who confirmed the meeting said. Biden had said he planned to make an announcement the first week in August, but aides later said that was unlikely. Whitmer declined to comment when asked about the meeting. On Thursday, medianame News reported that Whitmer was among those still under serious consideration. Democrats with knowledge of the process have said Whitmer did not recently re-emerge as a potential vice presidential pick but had long remained in Biden’s top tier. Public speculation of a possible pick has also centered around Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., former national security adviser Susan Rice and Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also in the running. Michigan is a battleground state, and President Donald Trump narrowly won it in the 2016 election by around 10,700 votes. Whitmer has earned the respect of Biden officials for her role in responding to the coronavirus pandemic — at times in the face of protests that included demonstrations outside the state capitol building in which some protesters were armed, and a tweet by Trump that read \"Liberate Michigan!\" in capital letters. She elevated her public profile earlier this year by battling with Trump over the federal response to the pandemic. Senior Biden campaign officials have made clear again in recent days that they believe the COVID-19 pandemic combined with Trump’s management of the crisis and the resulting economic fallout is the central issue of the fall campaign.\n",
       "215     Biden on Ditching Filibuster: Depends How 'Obstreperous' GOP Becomes  Joe Biden is refusing to rule out scrapping the Senate filibuster, arguing it remains to be seen how “obstreperous” Republicans will be after President Donald Trump leaves office.          The former vice president, who spent a majority of his nearly 40-year political career in the United States Senate, made the remarks on Monday in an interview with several prominent media outlets. Biden, in particular, claimed that while he had “not supported the elimination of the filibuster” in the past, a wait-and-see approach was needed until it was clear how Republicans would act in the post-Trump era.          “I think it’s gonna depend on how obstreperous [Republicans] become,” the former vice president told reporters, as noted by the Washington Post. Biden clarified that he was not necessarily expressing support in one direction or the other. “But I think you’re going to just have to take a look at it.”          The presumptive Democrat nominee added that he was optimistic that his administration would be able to forge a bipartisan consensus among congressional lawmakers, especially if his party were to win the Senate majority.          “I think I have a pretty good record of being able to pull together Democrats and Republicans,” Biden said, further noting that his long tenure in Congress made him “fairly good at understanding what the limitations of a senator [are] and trying to figure out how you help them.”          Biden’s comments on the topic come as a cadre of Democrat lawmakers are in talks to abolish the filibuster, which requires a three-fifths supermajority—usually 60 votes—to end debate on legislation in the Senate. The proposal, still in the early stages, is contingent upon Democrats winning both the White House and the Senate majority this November.          Even though no definitive agreement has been reached, a surprising number of lawmakers, including moderate Democrats, have expressed openness to either discarding or reforming the filibuster in recent weeks. Most notably, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Chris Coons (D-DE) have floated the idea as a way to prevent Republicans from obstructing Biden’s political agenda, provided the presumptive Democrat nominee wins.          “I will not stand idly by for four years and watch the Biden administration’s initiatives blocked at every turn,” Coons, a top congressional ally of the former vice president, said last month.          Progressive Democrats have argued that the filibuster is undemocratic as it allows a minority of lawmakers—at times even only one lawmaker—to hold up legislation favored by a majority of the Senate’s members. As neither party has held a supermajority within the chamber in recent years, bills without broad bipartisan support have gained little traction.          Some progressives, including Biden’s onetime rival and now potential running mate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) favor scrapping the rule in order to advance controversial legislation on topics such as gun control or abortion. Moderates, on the other hand, have defended the filibuster, claiming the limitation it imposed on majority rule was the “entire premise of the Senate” in the first place.\n",

Biden doubled down Friday on an earlier comment that he would not comply with a possible Senate subpoena. The 2020 presidential candidate tried to clarify his remarks Saturday on Twitter, writing that there would be no “legal basis” for the subpoena.          He later added that he would, in fact, comply if such a request came about, despite originally saying he would reject it.          “I would obey any subpoena that was sent to me,” Biden said Saturday during a town-hall style event in Iowa, the New York Times reported.          Biden’s drastic turn on complying with a subpoena is not the first time he has flip-flopped on an issue. After decades of supporting the death penalty, he tweeted in July that he now wants to “eliminate” it.          Biden also changed his position on the Hyde Amendment after backlash from members of the Democratic party in June. (‘If He’d Take It, Yes’: Biden Open To Nominating Obama For Supreme Court)          The former vice president criticized himself for answering the Senate subpoena question in the first place. He said that “This is going to be the news today” and noted he “shouldn’t even have answered the question.”          “I shouldn’t even have answered the question,” Biden said according to the NYT. “Because in answering the question, now there’s going to be another round. We’re not talking about: What did Trump do?”"

       "      <td>EL CENTRO, Calif. — When Manuel Ochoa started feeling sick — his body sore, his breathing restricted — he drove from his mother’s home in Mexicali, Mexico, to the U.S. border. The 65-year-old retiree parked his car at the border crossing and tried to drag himself to the country where he has permanent residency, and where his health insurance is valid. Just before he approached the port of entry, he collapsed in the sun. [Mexico to start reopening border region, other areas as coronavirus lockdown eases]          That’s when U.S. immigration officials made a call that has become increasingly common during the coronavirus outbreak: for an ambulance to transport a U.S. citizen or resident from the Mexican border to the nearest American hospital. As Mexico’s health-care system has strained under the coronavirus, small community hospitals in Southern California, some of the poorest in the state, have been flooded with Americans who have fallen ill and crossed the border. They are retirees and dual citizens, Americans working in Mexico or visiting family there. It is an example of how easily the virus moves between countries, even as governments — and particularly the Trump administration — have attempted to shut their borders. And it’s a window into how many American lives span the U.S.-Mexico border, including families who have moved freely across the region since before that line was drawn and whose movement has continued during the pandemic. Public health issues have always straddled the border here. Texas conducts mosquito-spraying campaigns with the Mexican state of Tamaulipas during dengue outbreaks. Arizona has joint firefighting exercises with Sonora. California and Baja California have long battled a cross-border tuberculosis epidemic together. The San Ysidro border crossing, south of San Diego, is the busiest ambulance pickup point in the United States. [Coronavirus on the border: Why Mexico has so few cases compared with the U.S.]          For years, the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission conducted simulations on how the two countries would respond if a pandemic settled on the border. A special procedure was created for Mexican ambulances to transfer patients to U.S. ambulances on American soil. Then a real pandemic struck. Now, approximately half of the coronavirus patients in several California border hospitals, including El Centro Regional Medical Center, are recent arrivals from Mexico. As a result of that surge, Imperial County, home to El Centro, has a much higher concentration of coronavirus cases — 760 per 100,000 residents — than any other county in California. “It’s amazing how this disease has taught us that borders don’t exist,” said Adolphe Edward, the chief executive of El Centro Regional. The hospital’s staff includes 60 people who cross the border from Mexicali each day to work. About 1.5 million Americans live in Mexico, and more than 250,000 of them live in the cities just south of California. Those cities have been hit harder by the coronavirus than almost anywhere else in Mexico. [The U.S. wants Mexico to keep its defense and health-care factories open. Mexican workers are getting sick and dying.] More than 300 medical personnel in Tijuana and its outskirts have been infected, according to Yanín Rendón Machuca, the head of the local health workers union. At the city’s general hospital, only a quarter of the staff remains at work. Ambulance drivers in Mexicali sometimes wait hours while hospital workers make room in hallways for patients with covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Some overwhelmed public clinics in the border city are no longer accepting patients. “We see patients who have been in Mexican hospitals for two, three or four days before they cross the border and come to us,” said Dennis Amundson, the medical director in the intensive care unit at Scripps Mercy Hospital in Chula Vista, Calif.          U.S. citizens and green-card holders in northern Mexico started sharing messages and Facebook posts in groups such as “Rosarito Living” and “Expats in Mexico.” If you get sick, they say, cross the border.

Even during the pandemic, the Mexican Red Cross is still responding to incidents involving gun violence in the border city. (Melina Mara/The medianame)          So that’s what Ochoa did. He’s been a permanent resident of the United States since 1978. He retired a few years ago after a career as a truck driver in Los Angeles. On Sunday morning, the ambulance drove him the 10 miles from the border to El Centro Regional, which was already treating 43 coronavirus patients and where a disaster response team was preparing to set up a military-style tent for overflow. “This is where I have insurance, and it’s where there’s better attention,” he said at the hospital. The machine reading his resting heart rate bounced between 128 and 135 beats per minute. [Coronavirus hits Mexico’s economy where it hurts most: Oil, tourism, remittances and trade]          During the pandemic, the influx of patients from Mexico has posed an unprecedented challenge. El Centro Regional normally serves a county with a population of about 180,000 residents, many of whom live below the poverty line. Suddenly, the hospital was responding to an additional community of Americans in Mexicali, thought to number 100,000 people. When Edward posted a video update on Facebook last week explaining that his overwhelmed hospital would temporarily stop accepting covid-19 patients, he received a stream of messages criticizing him for prioritizing patients from across the border. “Send them back to Mexico,” one person wrote. “The border should have been closed from day one,” wrote another. Edward, a former Air Force Medical Service Corps officer who helped lead the U.S. military’s medical team in Baghdad, tried to explain that these were Americans he was treating. “We can pretend that 275,000 American retirees in Baja California don’t exist, but they do. Or the 35,000 military members,” he said. The spike in cases along the border comes as California is trying to reopen. In San Diego on Memorial Day weekend, restaurants and bars were crowded with people, many not wearing masks. Medical experts warn that relaxing those rules, in addition to the cases coming across the border, could lead to a surge in infections. “I expect Mexico to peak this month, but then as San Diego opens up, we’ll see an increase from that side as well,” said Juan Tovar, a physician chief operations executive at Scripps Mercy. “Our peak is going to depend on both of those factors.”          [U.S. is deporting infected migrants back to vulnerable countries]          Among the patients who have come from Mexico in recent weeks is Patricia Gonzalez-Zuniga, a Tijuana physician who works frequently with the University of California at San Diego. Gonzalez-Zuniga and her husband were both diagnosed with covid-19 last month. Her husband’s health deteriorated rapidly. “I have no doubt that he would have died if we had stayed in Tijuana and gone to a hospital there,” she said. Others were U.S. citizens who took their children to Mexico for more-affordable child care. Some were Americans who had lost their jobs during the early weeks of the U.S. outbreak and went to live with relatives in Mexico to save money. “That’s where they were infected,” said Amundson, the ICU medical director at Scripps Mercy. “And they came back to be treated here.”          LEFT: Forty-eight percent of coronavirus patients at Scripps Mercy Hospital last week had been in Mexico during the previous week.

(Melina Mara/The medianame)          Before the pandemic, more than 200,000 people per day crossed the border from Mexico to California. The Trump administration closed the border to “nonessential travel” in March, and President Trump promised to “suspend immigration” to halt the spread of the virus. But after an initial dip in entries, the pace has begun to bounce back. An average of 86,000 people per day crossed the border during the week of May 11 to 18, a mix of U.S. citizens and residents and Mexicans with legal work visas whose jobs are deemed essential. No health screenings are being conducted at the border. When a medianame reporter crossed last week, an immigration agent looked at him and asked, “You’re not sick, are you?” before scanning his passport. [Mexican factories boost production of medical supplies for U.S. hospitals while country struggles with its own coronavirus outbreak]          The Department of Homeland Security’s senior medical officer for operations, Alex Eastman, told medical professionals in Southern California this month that they should be prepared for U.S. citizens or permanent residents to continue to cross the border, including for medical treatment. The federal government has dispatched teams from the National Disaster Medical System to the border to respond to the influx of patients. The California Department of Public Health has sent its own team. Some patients are being transferred as far north as Los Angeles to relieve border hospitals such as El Centro Regional. Forty-eight percent of patients at Scripps Mercy in Chula Vista last week had visited Mexico in the week before they were admitted. In the hospital’s lobby hangs a painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico’s patron saint. “We don’t think the border should be closed, but we do think health checks and contact tracing would make a difference,” said Chris Van Gorder, the chief executive of Scripps Health, which runs the hospital. “What we don’t want is people going back and forth across the border and infecting other people.”          Last month, Van Gorder wrote a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar asking them to apply pressure on Mexico to sharpen its public health response. “We also need the federal government to put pressure on Mexico to enforce social distancing and shelter-in-place policies as we have done in the United States,” he wrote. [Now joining the fight against coronavirus: The world’s armed rebels, drug cartels and gangs]          On the Texas-Mexico border, the dynamic appears to be inverted. Mexican officials have expressed concern that a growing outbreak in South Texas is spilling over into Tamaulipas, which had been largely spared during the pandemic. The United States has deported thousands of people to Tamaulipas since March. In Reynosa, Mexico, the largest city in the state, at least 16 deportees have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to Mayor Maki Ortiz. Before becoming mayor, she was Mexico’s undersecretary of health. “Why are they continuing these deportations in the middle of a deadly pandemic, including people who are already sick and who knows how many asymptomatic people?” she said. Between the deportees and the thousands of dual citizens who cross the border every day, Ortiz worries her city will wind up importing a large outbreak from Texas. “I say it as many times as I can on my television and radio messages: Stay in your homes and do not cross the border,” she said. “But when I look at the international bridges, I still see massive lines.”          In the nearby city of Matamoros, officials last week set up a checkpoint to question U.S. citizens crossing into Mexico and turned away some whose visits they deemed nonessential. Some health experts say the epidemiological curves in border cities on both sides will eventually overlap. “There are so many people crossing back and forth that it becomes one homogeneous rate,” said Arturo Rodriguez, the public health director of Brownsville, Tex. “In other words, you have three rates: the U.S., Mexico and your border rate.”          Photos by Melina Mara.

       "      <td>EXCLUSIVE: Republicans on the House Oversight Committee are calling on their Democratic colleagues to provide more details about a series of trips taken to Mexico while staff were touring border detention facilities, amid reports that at least one Democrat has been involved in “coaching” migrants there on how to exploit U.S. immigration law. In a letter to Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., obtained by medianame, ranking member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said there were at least two committee staff trips into Mexico in August — one of which required Border Patrol agents to provide a special escort back into the U.S.          DHS BARS DEM STAFFERS FROM VISITING BORDER FACILITIES AFTER 'RUDE' AND 'DISRUPTIVE' BEHAVIOR          “Although you have the authority to direct Committee staff to travel internationally on official committee business, you have not explained why you authorized this travel into Mexico or what you sought to learn through these trips,” Jordan wrote, adding that Republicans were not notified of the trips. Jordan went on to accuse Democrats of seeking “to delegitimize the administration’s border security efforts and vilify the men and women who protect our border.” He said GOP members are concerned the trips “could continue to result in misleading information about the administration’s border security efforts.”          medianame has reached out to Cummings' office for a response to Republicans' claims. Specifically, Jordan highlighted a report that said Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, was in attendance on one trip to Tijuana on Aug. 21. Escobar, who is not on the Oversight Committee, has been a vocal advocate of left-wing policies on illegal immigration. According to The Washington Examiner, staff from Escobar’s office recently coached migrants in Ciudad Juarez on how to exploit federal immigration law — including telling would-be border crossers to pretend they cannot speak Spanish to exploit a loophole that would let them enter the U.S.          Escobar responded by calling the article “fabricated” and “fueled by xenophobia and misinformation.”          ON THE BORDER, OFFICIALS SEE DIVIDENDS FROM TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO          In the letter, Jordan asked Democrats a number of questions including what the purpose of the visit was, which individuals and groups they interacted with, why Escobar’s office was invited, and what “coaching” on immigration laws, if any, was given to migrants. The letter marks the latest controversy over Democrats’ trips to the border. medianame first reported last month that the Department of Homeland Security had barred staffers from the committee from visiting Customs and Border Protection facilities at the U.S.-Mexico border during a trip after staff were allegedly disruptive and refused to follow instructions. Democrats suggested the visit was nixed due to concerns about what staff were learning from detainees about conditions on the ground. Cummings later wrote that his staff was blocked \"after previous staff inspections revealed potentially serious ongoing problems with the treatment of children and adults in DHS custody.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trump wanted to shoot migrants and build a wall guarded by alligators and flesh-piercing spikes</td>\n",
       "      <td>President Donald Trump reportedly suggested shooting migrants in the legs and warding them off from the southern border with snakes or alligators during a tense week in March that marked a crossroads in his enforcement strategy on the southern border.          The New York Times reported Tuesday that the president was fuming after his aides tried to talk him out of shutting down the 2,000-mile US-Mexico border as a way of driving down the number of migrants attempting to cross it.          Trump eventually settled on threatening to impose tariffs on all Mexican goods as a way to pressure Mexico to step up its immigration enforcement efforts before ultimately backing off — but the solutions he proposed to his advisers in private were much more extreme.          Privately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That’s not allowed either, they told him.          The comments come from an excerpt from an upcoming book, Border Wars: Inside Trump’s Assault on Immigration, by the Times’s Michael Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis, who depict the president as frustrated by the limits of the law, cheering the Border Patrol’s decision to fire tear gas at a peaceful march of migrants trying to cross the border last November, and dismissive of officials in his administration who challenged him.          Trump denied having ever proposed creating a moat or an electrified fence on Tuesday, but said nothing of his suggestion to shoot down migrants.          Trump wasn’t able to get his way on the particular proposals detailed in the excerpt, but the administration has taken a series of drastic steps to prevent almost anyone at the southern border from obtaining asylum.          The Trump administration is sending migrants who line up at a port of entry or who are arrested when trying to cross the southern border back to Mexico to await decisions on their asylum claims. Under the policy, which is known as “Remain in Mexico,” the US has returned more than 42,000 migrants to Mexico as of September 1, according to US Customs and Border Protection.          A rule that prevents migrants from applying for asylum if they passed through another country other than their own before arriving in the US has also gone into effect across the entire southern border. That means that asylum seekers from any country but Mexico are ineligible for asylum if they show up at the border.          And the Trump administration has recently reached agreements with Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala that would require migrants on their way to the US to seek protections in those countries first, effectively cutting off their access to the American asylum system before they even reach the southern border.          More and more people are applying for asylum in recent years: about 157,000 this fiscal year as of July, compared to about 82,000 for all of fiscal year 2016. The number of migrants arrested while trying to cross the southern border is even higher, up to 811,000 this fiscal year through August from 553,000 in 2016. Most of them are families and unaccompanied children, whereas previously those arrested were primarily single adult men.</td>\n",

       "      <td>'Propaganda': Immigration Activist Group Raices Slams Netflix Series 'Border Security: America's Front Line'</td>\n",
       "      <td>The latest season of Netflix’s Border Security: America’s Front Line has received a big thumbs down from a radical immigration and refugee activist group, which has called the show “propaganda” for border security.          Raices Texas recently tweeted its displeasure over the reality series that portrays the hard work performed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers and agents.          “@netflix propping up Border Patrol propaganda is not a good omen for our $12.99 a month subscription,” the activist organization tweeted.          Raices — the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services — provides legal aid to migrants and illegal aliens, helping them to navigate the U.S. court system. The open-borders group has called President Donald Trump’s immigration policies xenophobic and racist.          “The current crisis has been created by Trump’s xenophobic and racist policies. He’s targeted the most vulnerable people to stoke hatred for the other…We must enshrine and protect the right to come here and thrive,” the group tweeted in June.          Border Security: America’s Front Line is a Canadian-produced series that is distributed in the U.S. by Netflix. The reality series follows CPB officers and agents as they contend with drugs, contraband and illegal crossings.          Raices’ attack on the Netflix show has prompted some of the streaming company’s customers to cancel their subscriptions.          Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?

       "      <td>A brief guide to the State of the Union guests</td>\n",
       "      <td>For a preview of President Donald Trump’s message heading into his 2020 reelection campaign, just look at the guests he has invited to the State of the Union Tuesday.          From US Border Patrol Deputy Chief Raul Ortiz to contractor Paul Morrow, Trump’s invitees will allow him to tout some of his prized policy priorities — namely, border security, immigration, and economic growth.          The State of the Union guests have long been used to send a political message — and this year is certainly no different. Democrats, too, will be focused on making a statement: They are bringing more than 80 patients, physicians, and activists to illustrate their commitment to defending voters’ health care.          Trump’s State of the Union speech comes just one night before the Senate is scheduled to vote on his conviction or acquittal of two articles of impeachment, timing that has Republican lawmakers hoping he doesn’t use the opportunity to draw attention to the trial.          His guest list, thus far, doesn’t yet give a nod to these ongoing proceedings.          With this annual platform, Trump is expected to return to some of the themes that he’s hewed to ever since he first declared his candidacy. Several of the president’s guests underscore the recurring emphasis he’s put on border security and curbing unauthorized immigration.          Raul Ortiz: Ortiz is the recently promoted deputy chief of the US Border Patrol. He now holds the second-highest role in the agency, which is tasked with enforcing Trump’s policies on apprehending immigrants at the border and separating families. Ortiz is also a US Army veteran and previously oversaw border patrol operations in South Central Texas.          Jody Jones: Jones’s brother Rocky was killed by an unauthorized immigrant, who had previously been convicted of other criminal charges, in Tulare County, California. Jones has called for greater accountability of unauthorized immigrants who have committed crimes in the past, a call that Trump has also repeatedly emphasized when he’s made the case for curbing immigration.          Stephanie and Janiyah Davis: Stephanie and Janiyah, the White House says, were negatively affected by Pennsylvania’s decision not to increase the tax credits donors could receive when they contribute to scholarships for private schools. Stephanie is an advocate for school choice, a priority the White House has championed as well.          Kelli and Gage Hake: Kelli’s husband and Gage’s father, staff sergeant Christopher Hake, was killed by a roadside bomb while serving in Iraq. The White House alleges that his death was tied to weapons provided by Iranian leader Qassem Soleimani, an official who Trump assassinated earlier this year via a drone strike.          Tony Rankins: Rankins is a US Army veteran who served in Afghanistan who has struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder. He’s since received construction training and works in an Opportunity Zone in Cincinnati, Ohio. In Opportunity Zones, first established by the 2017 Republican tax bill, businesses and individuals receive tax breaks in exchange for their investment in lower-income areas, a method that hasn’t exactly been found to improve economic growth.          Paul Morrow: Morrow is a contractor currently building a concrete plant in an Opportunity Zone in Montgomery, Alabama.          Robin and Ellie Schneider: Ellie was born prematurely at 21 weeks and six days and is now 2 years old. The White House is highlighting her health as an example of the efficacy of medical care in the US.          Ivan Simonovis: Simonovis is a formerly imprisoned Venezuelan law enforcement official. The Trump administration has previously backed the Venezuela opposition led by Juan Guaidó.          In 2018, Democrats campaigned on protecting people’s health care — and they won, taking back a majority in the House and flipping two Senate seats. With the 2020 election looming this fall, it appears that they intend to focus on a similar message, particularly as a challenge against the ACA winds its way through the courts.          Health care: More than 80 Democrats will be bringing guests that speak to different aspects of health care policy including Kim Cesarek, a breast cancer patient; Bakari Burns, CEO of Health Care Center for the Homeless; and California surgeon general Nadine Burke Harris.          Democrats are eager to highlight the legislation they’ve passed that would maintain protections for individuals with preexisting conditions and reduce prescription drug prices.          Sexual assault: Courtney Wild, a Jeffrey Epstein survivor, will be the guest of Rep. Jackie Speier, who has long championed policies to combat sexual assault. Speier has introduced a bill called the Courtney Wild Crime Victims’ Rights Reform Act that would strengthen protections for victims as they use the judicial process to assert their case.          Gender equity: Virginia Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, a lawmaker who’s been integral in advancing the state’s ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, will be the guest of Rep. Carolyn Maloney. Presently, it’s up to Congress to decide if it intends to extend the ratification deadline of the ERA, which had expired decades earlier.          Foreign policy: Hatice Cengiz, the fiancée of murdered Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, will be the guest of Rep. Gerry Connolly. “Saudi Arabia must be held accountable for the murder of this loving father and fiancé, respected journalist, US resident, my constituent, and reformer,” Connolly said in a statement.          Immigration: DACA recipient Maria Rocha will be the guest of Rep. Joaquin Castro, and Ismail Alghazali, a New York City resident who was separated from his family by the Trump travel ban, will be the guest of Rep. Judy Chu.          Gun control: Activist Andrea Chamblee, the widow of John McNamara, a Capital Gazette journalist who was killed in the Annapolis shooting in 2018, will be the guest of Sen. Chris Van Hollen.</td>\n",

       "98   EL CENTRO, Calif. — When Manuel Ochoa started feeling sick — his body sore, his breathing restricted — he drove from his mother’s home in Mexicali, Mexico, to the U.S. border. The 65-year-old retiree parked his car at the border crossing and tried to drag himself to the country where he has permanent residency, and where his health insurance is valid. Just before he approached the port of entry, he collapsed in the sun. [Mexico to start reopening border region, other areas as coronavirus lockdown eases]          That’s when U.S. immigration officials made a call that has become increasingly common during the coronavirus outbreak: for an ambulance to transport a U.S. citizen or resident from the Mexican border to the nearest American hospital. As Mexico’s health-care system has strained under the coronavirus, small community hospitals in Southern California, some of the poorest in the state, have been flooded with Americans who have fallen ill and crossed the border. They are retirees and dual citizens, Americans working in Mexico or visiting family there. It is an example of how easily the virus moves between countries, even as governments — and particularly the Trump administration — have attempted to shut their borders. And it’s a window into how many American lives span the U.S.-Mexico border, including families who have moved freely across the region since before that line was drawn and whose movement has continued during the pandemic. Public health issues have always straddled the border here. Texas conducts mosquito-spraying campaigns with the Mexican state of Tamaulipas during dengue outbreaks. Arizona has joint firefighting exercises with Sonora. California and Baja California have long battled a cross-border tuberculosis epidemic together. The San Ysidro border crossing, south of San Diego, is the busiest ambulance pickup point in the United States. [Coronavirus on the border: Why Mexico has so few cases compared with the U.S.]          For years, the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission conducted simulations on how the two countries would respond if a pandemic settled on the border. A special procedure was created for Mexican ambulances to transfer patients to U.S. ambulances on American soil. Then a real pandemic struck. Now, approximately half of the coronavirus patients in several California border hospitals, including El Centro Regional Medical Center, are recent arrivals from Mexico. As a result of that surge, Imperial County, home to El Centro, has a much higher concentration of coronavirus cases — 760 per 100,000 residents — than any other county in California. “It’s amazing how this disease has taught us that borders don’t exist,” said Adolphe Edward, the chief executive of El Centro Regional. The hospital’s staff includes 60 people who cross the border from Mexicali each day to work. About 1.5 million Americans live in Mexico, and more than 250,000 of them live in the cities just south of California. Those cities have been hit harder by the coronavirus than almost anywhere else in Mexico. [The U.S. wants Mexico to keep its defense and health-care factories open. Mexican workers are getting sick and dying.] More than 300 medical personnel in Tijuana and its outskirts have been infected, according to Yanín Rendón Machuca, the head of the local health workers union. At the city’s general hospital, only a quarter of the staff remains at work. Ambulance drivers in Mexicali sometimes wait hours while hospital workers make room in hallways for patients with covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Some overwhelmed public clinics in the border city are no longer accepting patients. “We see patients who have been in Mexican hospitals for two, three or four days before they cross the border and come to us,” said Dennis Amundson, the medical director in the intensive care unit at Scripps Mercy Hospital in Chula Vista, Calif.          U.S. citizens and green-card holders in northern Mexico started sharing messages and Facebook posts in groups such as “Rosarito Living” and “Expats in Mexico.” If you get sick, they say, cross the border.

Even during the pandemic, the Mexican Red Cross is still responding to incidents involving gun violence in the border city. (Melina Mara/The medianame)          So that’s what Ochoa did. He’s been a permanent resident of the United States since 1978. He retired a few years ago after a career as a truck driver in Los Angeles. On Sunday morning, the ambulance drove him the 10 miles from the border to El Centro Regional, which was already treating 43 coronavirus patients and where a disaster response team was preparing to set up a military-style tent for overflow. “This is where I have insurance, and it’s where there’s better attention,” he said at the hospital. The machine reading his resting heart rate bounced between 128 and 135 beats per minute. [Coronavirus hits Mexico’s economy where it hurts most: Oil, tourism, remittances and trade]          During the pandemic, the influx of patients from Mexico has posed an unprecedented challenge. El Centro Regional normally serves a county with a population of about 180,000 residents, many of whom live below the poverty line. Suddenly, the hospital was responding to an additional community of Americans in Mexicali, thought to number 100,000 people. When Edward posted a video update on Facebook last week explaining that his overwhelmed hospital would temporarily stop accepting covid-19 patients, he received a stream of messages criticizing him for prioritizing patients from across the border. “Send them back to Mexico,” one person wrote. “The border should have been closed from day one,” wrote another. Edward, a former Air Force Medical Service Corps officer who helped lead the U.S. military’s medical team in Baghdad, tried to explain that these were Americans he was treating. “We can pretend that 275,000 American retirees in Baja California don’t exist, but they do. Or the 35,000 military members,” he said. The spike in cases along the border comes as California is trying to reopen. In San Diego on Memorial Day weekend, restaurants and bars were crowded with people, many not wearing masks. Medical experts warn that relaxing those rules, in addition to the cases coming across the border, could lead to a surge in infections. “I expect Mexico to peak this month, but then as San Diego opens up, we’ll see an increase from that side as well,” said Juan Tovar, a physician chief operations executive at Scripps Mercy. “Our peak is going to depend on both of those factors.”          [U.S. is deporting infected migrants back to vulnerable countries]          Among the patients who have come from Mexico in recent weeks is Patricia Gonzalez-Zuniga, a Tijuana physician who works frequently with the University of California at San Diego. Gonzalez-Zuniga and her husband were both diagnosed with covid-19 last month. Her husband’s health deteriorated rapidly. “I have no doubt that he would have died if we had stayed in Tijuana and gone to a hospital there,” she said. Others were U.S. citizens who took their children to Mexico for more-affordable child care. Some were Americans who had lost their jobs during the early weeks of the U.S. outbreak and went to live with relatives in Mexico to save money. “That’s where they were infected,” said Amundson, the ICU medical director at Scripps Mercy. “And they came back to be treated here.”          LEFT: Forty-eight percent of coronavirus patients at Scripps Mercy Hospital last week had been in Mexico during the previous week.

(Melina Mara/The medianame)          Before the pandemic, more than 200,000 people per day crossed the border from Mexico to California. The Trump administration closed the border to “nonessential travel” in March, and President Trump promised to “suspend immigration” to halt the spread of the virus. But after an initial dip in entries, the pace has begun to bounce back. An average of 86,000 people per day crossed the border during the week of May 11 to 18, a mix of U.S. citizens and residents and Mexicans with legal work visas whose jobs are deemed essential. No health screenings are being conducted at the border. When a medianame reporter crossed last week, an immigration agent looked at him and asked, “You’re not sick, are you?” before scanning his passport. [Mexican factories boost production of medical supplies for U.S. hospitals while country struggles with its own coronavirus outbreak]          The Department of Homeland Security’s senior medical officer for operations, Alex Eastman, told medical professionals in Southern California this month that they should be prepared for U.S. citizens or permanent residents to continue to cross the border, including for medical treatment. The federal government has dispatched teams from the National Disaster Medical System to the border to respond to the influx of patients. The California Department of Public Health has sent its own team. Some patients are being transferred as far north as Los Angeles to relieve border hospitals such as El Centro Regional. Forty-eight percent of patients at Scripps Mercy in Chula Vista last week had visited Mexico in the week before they were admitted. In the hospital’s lobby hangs a painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico’s patron saint. “We don’t think the border should be closed, but we do think health checks and contact tracing would make a difference,” said Chris Van Gorder, the chief executive of Scripps Health, which runs the hospital. “What we don’t want is people going back and forth across the border and infecting other people.”          Last month, Van Gorder wrote a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar asking them to apply pressure on Mexico to sharpen its public health response. “We also need the federal government to put pressure on Mexico to enforce social distancing and shelter-in-place policies as we have done in the United States,” he wrote. [Now joining the fight against coronavirus: The world’s armed rebels, drug cartels and gangs]          On the Texas-Mexico border, the dynamic appears to be inverted. Mexican officials have expressed concern that a growing outbreak in South Texas is spilling over into Tamaulipas, which had been largely spared during the pandemic. The United States has deported thousands of people to Tamaulipas since March. In Reynosa, Mexico, the largest city in the state, at least 16 deportees have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to Mayor Maki Ortiz. Before becoming mayor, she was Mexico’s undersecretary of health. “Why are they continuing these deportations in the middle of a deadly pandemic, including people who are already sick and who knows how many asymptomatic people?” she said. Between the deportees and the thousands of dual citizens who cross the border every day, Ortiz worries her city will wind up importing a large outbreak from Texas. “I say it as many times as I can on my television and radio messages: Stay in your homes and do not cross the border,” she said. “But when I look at the international bridges, I still see massive lines.”          In the nearby city of Matamoros, officials last week set up a checkpoint to question U.S. citizens crossing into Mexico and turned away some whose visits they deemed nonessential. Some health experts say the epidemiological curves in border cities on both sides will eventually overlap. “There are so many people crossing back and forth that it becomes one homogeneous rate,” said Arturo Rodriguez, the public health director of Brownsville, Tex. “In other words, you have three rates: the U.S., Mexico and your border rate.”          Photos by Melina Mara.

colleagues to provide more details about a series of trips taken to Mexico while staff were touring border detention facilities, amid reports that at least one Democrat has been involved in “coaching” migrants there on how to exploit U.S. immigration law. In a letter to Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., obtained by medianame, ranking member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said there were at least two committee staff trips into Mexico in August — one of which required Border Patrol agents to provide a special escort back into the U.S.          DHS BARS DEM STAFFERS FROM VISITING BORDER FACILITIES AFTER 'RUDE' AND 'DISRUPTIVE' BEHAVIOR          “Although you have the authority to direct Committee staff to travel internationally on official committee business, you have not explained why you authorized this travel into Mexico or what you sought to learn through these trips,” Jordan wrote, adding that Republicans were not notified of the trips. Jordan went on to accuse Democrats of seeking “to delegitimize the administration’s border security efforts and vilify the men and women who protect our border.” He said GOP members are concerned the trips “could continue to result in misleading information about the administration’s border security efforts.”          medianame has reached out to Cummings' office for a response to Republicans' claims. Specifically, Jordan highlighted a report that said Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, was in attendance on one trip to Tijuana on Aug. 21. Escobar, who is not on the Oversight Committee, has been a vocal advocate of left-wing policies on illegal immigration. According to The Washington Examiner, staff from Escobar’s office recently coached migrants in Ciudad Juarez on how to exploit federal immigration law — including telling would-be border crossers to pretend they cannot speak Spanish to exploit a loophole that would let them enter the U.S.          Escobar responded by calling the article “fabricated” and “fueled by xenophobia and misinformation.”          ON THE BORDER, OFFICIALS SEE DIVIDENDS FROM TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO          In the letter, Jordan asked Democrats a number of questions including what the purpose of the visit was, which individuals and groups they interacted with, why Escobar’s office was invited, and what “coaching” on immigration laws, if any, was given to migrants. The letter marks the latest controversy over Democrats’ trips to the border. medianame first reported last month that the Department of Homeland Security had barred staffers from the committee from visiting Customs and Border Protection facilities at the U.S.-Mexico border during a trip after staff were allegedly disruptive and refused to follow instructions. Democrats suggested the visit was nixed due to concerns about what staff were learning from detainees about conditions on the ground. Cummings later wrote that his staff was blocked \"after previous staff inspections revealed potentially serious ongoing problems with the treatment of children and adults in DHS custody.\"  \n",

                 President Donald Trump reportedly suggested shooting migrants in the legs and warding them off from the southern border with snakes or alligators during a tense week in March that marked a crossroads in his enforcement strategy on the southern border.          The New York Times reported Tuesday that the president was fuming after his aides tried to talk him out of shutting down the 2,000-mile US-Mexico border as a way of driving down the number of migrants attempting to cross it.          Trump eventually settled on threatening to impose tariffs on all Mexican goods as a way to pressure Mexico to step up its immigration enforcement efforts before ultimately backing off — but the solutions he proposed to his advisers in private were much more extreme.          Privately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That’s not allowed either, they told him.          The comments come from an excerpt from an upcoming book, Border Wars: Inside Trump’s Assault on Immigration, by the Times’s Michael Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis, who depict the president as frustrated by the limits of the law, cheering the Border Patrol’s decision to fire tear gas at a peaceful march of migrants trying to cross the border last November, and dismissive of officials in his administration who challenged him.          Trump denied having ever proposed creating a moat or an electrified fence on Tuesday, but said nothing of his suggestion to shoot down migrants.          Trump wasn’t able to get his way on the particular proposals detailed in the excerpt, but the administration has taken a series of drastic steps to prevent almost anyone at the southern border from obtaining asylum.          The Trump administration is sending migrants who line up at a port of entry or who are arrested when trying to cross the southern border back to Mexico to await decisions on their asylum claims. Under the policy, which is known as “Remain in Mexico,” the US has returned more than 42,000 migrants to Mexico as of September 1, according to US Customs and Border Protection.          A rule that prevents migrants from applying for asylum if they passed through another country other than their own before arriving in the US has also gone into effect across the entire southern border. That means that asylum seekers from any country but Mexico are ineligible for asylum if they show up at the border.          And the Trump administration has recently reached agreements with Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala that would require migrants on their way to the US to seek protections in those countries first, effectively cutting off their access to the American asylum system before they even reach the southern border.          More and more people are applying for asylum in recent years: about 157,000 this fiscal year as of July, compared to about 82,000 for all of fiscal year 2016. The number of migrants arrested while trying to cross the southern border is even higher, up to 811,000 this fiscal year through August from 553,000 in 2016. Most of them are families and unaccompanied children, whereas previously those arrested were primarily single adult men.  \n",

immigration and refugee activist group, which has called the show “propaganda” for border security.          Raices Texas recently tweeted its displeasure over the reality series that portrays the hard work performed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers and agents.          “@netflix propping up Border Patrol propaganda is not a good omen for our $12.99 a month subscription,” the activist organization tweeted.          Raices — the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services — provides legal aid to migrants and illegal aliens, helping them to navigate the U.S. court system. The open-borders group has called President Donald Trump’s immigration policies xenophobic and racist.          “The current crisis has been created by Trump’s xenophobic and racist policies. He’s targeted the most vulnerable people to stoke hatred for the other…We must enshrine and protect the right to come here and thrive,” the group tweeted in June.          Border Security: America’s Front Line is a Canadian-produced series that is distributed in the U.S. by Netflix. The reality series follows CPB officers and agents as they contend with drugs, contraband and illegal crossings.          Raices’ attack on the Netflix show has prompted some of the streaming company’s customers to cancel their subscriptions.          Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               For a preview of President Donald Trump’s message heading into his 2020 reelection campaign, just look at the guests he has invited to the State of the Union Tuesday.          From US Border Patrol Deputy Chief Raul Ortiz to contractor Paul Morrow, Trump’s invitees will allow him to tout some of his prized policy priorities — namely, border security, immigration, and economic growth.          The State of the Union guests have long been used to send a political message — and this year is certainly no different. Democrats, too, will be focused on making a statement: They are bringing more than 80 patients, physicians, and activists to illustrate their commitment to defending voters’ health care.          Trump’s State of the Union speech comes just one night before the Senate is scheduled to vote on his conviction or acquittal of two articles of impeachment, timing that has Republican lawmakers hoping he doesn’t use the opportunity to draw attention to the trial.          His guest list, thus far, doesn’t yet give a nod to these ongoing proceedings.          With this annual platform, Trump is expected to return to some of the themes that he’s hewed to ever since he first declared his candidacy. Several of the president’s guests underscore the recurring emphasis he’s put on border security and curbing unauthorized immigration.          Raul Ortiz: Ortiz is the recently promoted deputy chief of the US Border Patrol. He now holds the second-highest role in the agency, which is tasked with enforcing Trump’s policies on apprehending immigrants at the border and separating families. Ortiz is also a US Army veteran and previously oversaw border patrol operations in South Central Texas.          Jody Jones: Jones’s brother Rocky was killed by an unauthorized immigrant, who had previously been convicted of other criminal charges, in Tulare County, California. Jones has called for greater accountability of unauthorized immigrants who have committed crimes in the past, a call that Trump has also repeatedly emphasized when he’s made the case for curbing immigration.          Stephanie and Janiyah Davis: Stephanie and Janiyah, the White House says, were negatively affected by Pennsylvania’s decision not to increase the tax credits donors could receive when they contribute to scholarships for private schools. Stephanie is an advocate for school choice, a priority the White House has championed as well.          Kelli and Gage Hake: Kelli’s husband and Gage’s father, staff sergeant Christopher Hake, was killed by a roadside bomb while serving in Iraq. The White House alleges that his death was tied to weapons provided by Iranian leader Qassem Soleimani, an official who Trump assassinated earlier this year via a drone strike.          Tony Rankins: Rankins is a US Army veteran who served in Afghanistan who has struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder. He’s since received construction training and works in an Opportunity Zone in Cincinnati, Ohio. In Opportunity Zones, first established by the 2017 Republican tax bill, businesses and individuals receive tax breaks in exchange for their investment in lower-income areas, a method that hasn’t exactly been found to improve economic growth.          Paul Morrow: Morrow is a contractor currently building a concrete plant in an Opportunity Zone in Montgomery, Alabama.          Robin and Ellie Schneider: Ellie was born prematurely at 21 weeks and six days and is now 2 years old. The White House is highlighting her health as an example of the efficacy of medical care in the US.          Ivan Simonovis: Simonovis is a formerly imprisoned Venezuelan law enforcement official. The Trump administration has previously backed the Venezuela opposition led by Juan Guaidó.          In 2018, Democrats campaigned on protecting people’s health care — and they won, taking back a majority in the House and flipping two Senate seats. With the 2020 election looming this fall, it appears that they intend to focus on a similar message, particularly as a challenge against the ACA winds its way through the courts.          Health care: More than 80 Democrats will be bringing guests that speak to different aspects of health care policy including Kim Cesarek, a breast cancer patient; Bakari Burns, CEO of Health Care Center for the Homeless; and California surgeon general Nadine Burke Harris.          Democrats are eager to highlight the legislation they’ve passed that would maintain protections for individuals with preexisting conditions and reduce prescription drug prices.          Sexual assault: Courtney Wild, a Jeffrey Epstein survivor, will be the guest of Rep. Jackie Speier, who has long championed policies to combat sexual assault. Speier has introduced a bill called the Courtney Wild Crime Victims’ Rights Reform Act that would strengthen protections for victims as they use the judicial process to assert their case.          Gender equity: Virginia Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, a lawmaker who’s been integral in advancing the state’s ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, will be the guest of Rep. Carolyn Maloney. Presently, it’s up to Congress to decide if it intends to extend the ratification deadline of the ERA, which had expired decades earlier.          Foreign policy: Hatice Cengiz, the fiancée of murdered Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, will be the guest of Rep. Gerry Connolly. “Saudi Arabia must be held accountable for the murder of this loving father and fiancé, respected journalist, US resident, my constituent, and reformer,” Connolly said in a statement.          Immigration: DACA recipient Maria Rocha will be the guest of Rep. Joaquin Castro, and Ismail Alghazali, a New York City resident who was separated from his family by the Trump travel ban, will be the guest of Rep. Judy Chu.          Gun control: Activist Andrea Chamblee, the widow of John McNamara, a Capital Gazette journalist who was killed in the Annapolis shooting in 2018, will be the guest of Sen. Chris Van Hollen.  "

       "      <td>Trump Is Trampling Dozens of Laws to Build His Border Wall. Here’s How.</td>\n",
       "      <td>On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced that it will speed up construction of the border wall before the 2020 election by ignoring a law it doesn’t like. That’s nothing new: Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump has decried the “lawless state of our southern border”—but his administration has repeatedly suspended the law to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico. In less than three years, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has relied on a single federal law, the Real ID Act of 2005, to push aside nearly 50 statutes to put up portions of a border wall. This time around, DHS will disregard a rule that forces contractors to compete for funds (even though Trump campaigned on cutting waste by awarding contracts to the lowest bidder).          Most Americans probably know the Real ID Act as the law that coerced states into adopting stricter standards for driver’s licenses that take effect later this year. But Congress, which passed the statute with large bipartisan majorities, larded it up with massive grants of power to the Department of Homeland Security. Most notably, the act declared that the Secretary of Homeland Security “shall have the authority to waive all legal requirements” that she “determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction” of a border wall. In other words, any DHS secretary seeking to build a wall can cast aside all laws, state and federal, that might stand in her way.          Michael Chertoff, secretary of homeland security under George W. Bush, cited this provision on four occasions to build border fencing. Barack Obama’s DHS secretaries never used it. Trump’s DHS secretaries, by contrast, have cited the Real ID Act over and over again to override dozens of laws protecting the environment, Native American land, historic preservations, national monuments, and archaeological sites. The Sierra Club, which has challenged the wall in court, keeps a running tab of the roughly 50 laws that Trump’s DHS has overridden. So does Kenneth D. Madsen, a professor at Ohio State University, who has laid out each waiver in a dizzying chart.          The consequences of Trump’s rushed construction have already been devastating. A Wall Street Journal investigation found that the wall imperils a mind-boggling array of species. More than 60 percent of species jeopardized by the border wall are already endangered, while 24 percent are threatened. Eighteen types of birds alone, including the bald eagle, will be affected by the wall, as will countless species critical to the region’s biodiversity. The wall has already cut through Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, as well as Quitobaquito Springs, home to an endangered pupfish that lives nowhere else in the world. Trump’s wall replaces previous fencing that was wide enough for animals to pass through. Scientists have found that the wall will wreck migration patterns, bisecting the geographic range of 1,506 native animals and plants, including 62 critically endangered species.          The lives of local communities and tribes will be upended by the wall. The new barrier will cause deadly flooding by trapping debris and turning into a dam that pushes the Rio Grande into border towns. As climate change exacerbates flooding in the region, border towns will suffer immense property damage. Contractors building Trump’s wall have also blasted through sacred Native American sites, including ancient burial grounds where construction crews have found bone fragments.          Since Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned in April 2019, this authority has been exercised by acting secretaries, who did not obtain Senate confirmation to lead the agency. Chad Wolf, the current acting secretary, is thus allowed to set aside any law enacted by the people’s representatives despite never being confirmed to his position by the people’s representatives.          The Supreme Court has never ruled on the merits of this vast delegation of power to an unelected bureaucrat. And Congress’ decision to give a federal agency so much lawmaking authority is the kind of thing that sometimes incenses the conservative justices. But when conservation groups challenged the administration’s authority to waive environmental laws, the lower courts threw out their case, and SCOTUS declined to hear it. The court’s far-right bloc appears eager to let Trump forge ahead with his wall, legal roadblocks be damned. After Congress refused to fund construction, Trump declared a national emergency in 2019, then diverted billions of dollars in military funding to finance the wall. The courts initially halted construction, because federal law bars Trump from transferring money to fund an “item” that Congress already “denied”—and Congress denied funding for the border wall.          In July 2019, however, the Supreme Court issued a 5–4 order allowing Trump to raid military funding and begin building the wall. The majority provided just one sentence of reasoning, declaring that the government had “made a sufficient showing” that the plaintiffs—advocacy groups led by the Sierra Club—had “no cause of action.” This threadbare justification does not even hint that the government acted lawfully. Rather, it suggests that the court’s conservatives do not believe federal law permits anyone to challenge the administration’s misuse of federal funds to build the wall.          The ruling didn’t address the Real ID Act, but once Trump got the green light to pour money into construction, his DHS amped up construction. The border wall is a testament to the president’s ability to sidestep Congress with the help of a pliant Supreme Court. If the southern border is, in fact, lawless, that is because Trump has eliminated the law there.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Catholic Diocese of Brownsville must allow the Trump administration to survey land around the 120-year-old historic La Lomita Chapel to potentially make way for the president’s proposed border wall, a Texas judge determined Wednesday.          But the administration’s seeming victory toward securing land for the wall comes with one major caveat: The pre-border surveying will be under terms set by the diocese.          “Honestly, we expected the judge to rule this way, but we are pleasantly surprised that he allowed the survey to happen on our terms,” Father Roy Snipes, a 73-year-old clergyman who leads a nearby Catholic church, told The medianame on Wednesday. “We are going to continue to fight to ensure the wall isn’t built across our mother church.”          U.S. District Judge Randy Crane ruled Wednesday in the Texas Southern District Court that the government’s access to survey land surrounding the historic “mother” chapel, which sits 800 feet from the southern border, must be negationated by both parties.          Crane did not, however, rule on what would happen if the survey—the first step toward wall construction—determines the church-owned land is necessary to seize for building the barrier.          “As the Diocese recognizes, the more substantial burden—which it believes will violate its right to religious exercise under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act—will come if and when the government seeks to take the property for the building of a wall cutting off La Lomita from those who worship there,” Mary McCord, the diocese’s attorney and a senior litigator for the Georgetown’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, told The medianame on Wednesday.          McCord admitted the decision was expected, and argued in court that the border wall violated the church’s religious freedom by restricting church to La Lomita Chapel.          As previously reported by The medianame, the diocese has called the wall “fundamentally inconsistent with Catholic values” and stated Trump’s plans could limit access to or totally destroy the chapel, which has served as the religious heart of Mission, Texas for more than a century.          In response, the government’s attorneys assured that wall construction would leave the church usable by both Texans and their southern neighbors intact.          “We have no desire to go into the chapel,” the federal attorney said, according to court reporters.          While the border wall may not ultimately disrupt access to the single-room structure in the middle of an open field, Bishop Flores, who has led the diocese since 2009, believes that a wall near the house of worship would be enough to burden the “sanctity of church.”          If the government were to use eminent domain to secure the land around La Lomita, Flories argued, the lights from the 150-foot enforcement zone would be enough to violate religious rights.          “La Lomita has always been known as a safe and welcoming place for everyone, despite their citizenship status, race, gender, or ethnicity,” Flores said. “It hinders the religious freedoms of residents in the area and across the border who may be scared to go through. It ruins the sanctity and purpose of church.”          As one of the five border dioceses, Brownsville’s unique placement next to the Rio Grande could give customs and border-patrol officials the opportunity to monitor and interrogate churchgoers on their immigration status, the diocese argued, thus violating their First Amendment rights.          “Even this temporary access is an intrusion on those using the chapel for prayer,” McCord said. “This is just the first step in our fight to protect the Rio Grande Valley Catholic community’s right to free exercise of religious beliefs.”          McCord anticipates the church and federal officials will begin talks on entry restrictions by the end of the week, where the focus will be on protecting La Lomita to ensure worship at the chapel is not interrupted.          The plea for religious freedom even reached the U.S. Capitol, as three congressman added new language preventing wall funding for protected areas to the Democratic proposal to end last month’s partial government shutdown.          The proposal sought to protect five historical and cultural landmarks, including La Lomita Chapel, by prohibiting any funds for any physical barrier around these sites.          “This is a big win for South Texas,” Congressman Henry Cuellar (D-TX) said in a statement last month. “I worked hard to include this language because I know we can secure the border in a much more effective way, and at a fraction of the cost, by utilizing advanced technology and increasing the agents and properly equipping them on the border.”          Four top Democrats also sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen last month to question the administration’s plan to use eminent domain to seize land from border-town religious groups.          “Eminent domain should not be involved in violation of any religious organization’s First Amendment right of free exercise of religion, Fifth Amendment right to just compensation for any public taking of private property, or the Religious Freedom Restoration act,” the senators wrote.          A DHS spokesperson declined The medianame’s request for comment on whether the agency ever responded to the letter.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Opinion | Trump’s border wall wouldn’t stop most illegal immigration or drugs. So what is it for?</td>\n",
       "      <td>Mr. Trump has scaled back his initial promise to build a wall along the entire length of the frontier, saying that 1,000 miles of new barriers should suffice. He is pressing to complete nearly half of that by the end of next year, having deputized his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to ride herd on the project.          That’s a tall order given that the government will have to fight court battles with private land owners to take much of the land where the wall would be built. Other impediments include objections arising from the wall’s environmental impact; opposition by congressional Democrats, who are in no mood to appropriate the $5 billion the White House is demanding for the wall in the current fiscal year; and, most recently, a federal court order blocking the administration’s plan to divert $3.6 billion for wall construction from funds approved by Congress for projects on military bases at home and overseas.          Those fights may intensify as the wall’s overall cost, which Mr. Trump once put at $8 billion, turns out to be several times that amount. In the meantime, it’s worth bearing in mind what the wall might and might not achieve.          It might provide an additional deterrent to unauthorized crossing for some migrants not already deterred by policy obstacles the administration has adopted. However, the border wall will not be an impregnable barrier. As medianame’s Nick Miroff wrote last month, Mexican gang members have already figured out that a cordless household tool, available at hardware stores for as little as $100, can slice through the steel-and-concrete bollards from which the new wall will be built.          Nor is it likely to drastically reduce overall numbers of unauthorized migrants in the United States, who for most of the past decade have included many more people who overstay their visas than who cross the border illegally. A report this year by the Center for Migration Studies calculated that about two-thirds of new illegal entries in recent years have been overstays, who now account for more than 40 percent of some 11 million unauthorized immigrants.          The wall is also unlikely to address contraband smuggling, including of heroin and fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid. Most of those substances enter the country through legal ports of entry along the southwest border, hidden in cars and trucks.          The president has convinced many of his supporters that the wall, which Mexico is not paying for, is worth any expense or funding method. The rest of the American public is justified in its skepticism.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Defense Department Approves Funding For 20 Miles of U.S./Mexico Border Wall</td>\n",
       "      <td>Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Wednesday that he has authorized funding to go toward building 20 miles of wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, the latest move inside the Pentagon toward accomplishing President Donald Trump’s long-promised campaign goal.          The Defense Department had earlier approved $2.5 billion toward more than 100 miles of barrier construction requested by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the El Paso, Texas, and Yuma and Tucson, Ariz. sectors. In an unanticipated development — particularly at the Pentagon — the project was more affordable than initially planned.          “The [Army] Corps of Engineers successfully negotiated lower prices than expected, which freed up money to do more miles,” Esper said during his first press conference at the Pentagon. “It was as simple as that.”          Earlier this year, Congress gave Trump funding to build 55 miles of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but Trump declared a national emergency — a move aimed at accessing $6.7 billion in federal funding without receiving Congressional approval. That decision was widely seen as a last-ditch “nuclear option,” and has since sparked legal challenges and rattled the balance of power in the federal government. So far this year, only replacement barrier has been built, not the wall Trump promised on the 2016 campaign trail.          At the Defense Department, officials have played what amounts to a bureaucratic shell game to get money for the wall. The Pentagon took leftover money that had been allocated for military personnel and transferred it into a counter-drug account, a move that gave the military authority to take measures to support federal law enforcement efforts to stop drug trafficking, like building a wall.          The decision is currently being challenged in the courts by the Sierra Club, American Civil Liberties Union and Southern Border Communities Coalition. However, the Supreme Court said last month in a 5-4 vote that wall construction can continue while the federal appeals process plays out.          Esper, just a month after assuming the role of Defense Secretary, may also take another $3.6 billion set for military construction funds — money which is typically intended for housing, maintenance and repair — and funnel it toward Trump’s border wall. Democrats and Republicans alike have lambasted the plan out of fears that projects in their home states will be targeted. At Congress’s request, the Pentagon has sent around a list of construction jobs at-risk, which included more than 400 projects worth about $13 billion.          The U.S. military has been forbidden to take part in domestic law enforcement since the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. Service members can only assist, and that’s exactly what they have done since Trump directed the military to support DHS on the border more than a year ago. The Defense Department has approved multiple DHS requests, including for providing aerial reconnaissance, ground surveillance, search and rescue support, medical support, engineering support, helicopter transportation, personnel protection and other needs.          There are now about 5,700 troops, including 2,000 members of the National Guard, deployed along the southwest border. U.S. troops have welded coils of razor wire atop border fences and points of entry with Mexico in California, Arizona and Texas. They have coated parts of the fence with “anti-climb” paint. They also operate telescopic video cameras, known as “Mobile Surveillance Cameras,” in all nine border Patrol Sectors in each of the four states bordering Mexico. The devices are armed with infrared cameras, enabling troops to watch for illegal border crossings to operate day or night.          As of April, the Pentagon spent a total of $292 million on the deployment, according to a seven-page Defense Department letter sent to Rep. Anthony Brown, a Maryland Democrat, who requested additional information about the mission. The letter estimated the total cost of Pentagon support is at least $431 million through this fiscal year.</td>\n",

       "      <td>These Wall Street Companies Are Ready to Cash In on Trump’s Border Wall</td>\n",
       "      <td>Much of the discussion on President Donald Trump’s border wall has focused on its cost and impracticality, as well as the anti-immigrant and racist rhetoric it embodies. Little attention, however, has been paid to who specifically might profit from building the structure. Earlier this year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection chose six companies to build prototypes for the wall in both concrete and “other materials” — and last month they unveiled eight different proposals, the closest this administration has come to fulfilling its signature campaign promise. All but one of the companies that built prototypes are privately held, but a close look at Sterling Construction Company, a publicly traded company based in Texas, suggests that even investors who have distanced themselves from the president’s immigration policies are eager to cash in should the wall actually come to pass. A report on Sterling’s Wall Street investors, published today by a coalition of advocacy groups, warns of the “growing alignment” between the financial elite and the nationalist right-wing, and argues that Trump’s policies are not just a reflection of hard-line nativist ideology, but also of the economic and financial interests of beneficiaries that have largely been able to deflect scrutiny. “Wall Street leaders across the political spectrum have positioned themselves to benefit financially from Trump’s wildly unpopular and expensive border wall,” write the authors of the report. “Their companies’ investments in the wall demonstrate a clear willingness to benefit financially from Trump’s most divisive immigration proposal.” “Lacking from the public narrative is that corporate billionaires stand to gain the most financially,” Nikki Fortunato Bas, executive director of Partnership for Working Families, told medianame. Other groups in the coalition include the Center for Popular Democracy, Make the Road New York, and New York Communities for Change. As the report notes, Sterling’s stock value has already soared by 65 percent since the company was picked to develop a prototype for the wall at the end of August. Estimates for the wall’s cost vary widely, with some reports calculating that it will soar as high as $70 billion (plus $150 million a year in maintenance), others putting the number at $27 billion to $40 billion, and the president promising a much cheaper $12 billion.          This summer, the House of Representatives allocated $1.6 billion to start the wall’s construction — and Trump has promised to shut down the government to secure funding for the rest. “Believe me, if we have to close down our government, we’re building that wall,” he said in August. Last month, the House Homeland Security Committee approved a border security bill that includes $10 billion for the wall. Despite Trump’s repeated claims, that money will come from taxpayers’ pockets, not Mexico. But whatever the final price tag, Wall Street is ready to cash in. While details on the other bidders are harder to get, scrutiny of Sterling’s shareholders reveals that investors across the political spectrum are betting on the wall. Private equity firm BlackRock — headed by longtime Democrat donor Larry Fink — is the largest investor in Sterling, owning nearly 8 percent of its stock as of November 1. Between March and June of this year, as Sterling prepared to bid on the prototype contract, BlackRock increased its investment in the company by 195 percent. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase, whose CEO Jamie Dimon has spoken critically of Trump’s immigration policies, invested in Sterling for the first time over that period. “What a coincidence,” said Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy. “If you look at the investments in this particular company, you see how there is a very clear, intentional positioning to benefit from the building of the wall and by extension, from the policies that criminalize and punish immigrant families and cause tremendous amounts of suffering.” Some of Sterling’s largest investors have made no secret of their ideological alignment with Trump. Two of the firm’s five largest stakeholders are investment firms: Dimensional Fund Advisors LP, whose co-founder Rex Sinquefield is an activist donor to conservative causes and an outspoken opponent of the income tax, and Renaissance Technologies, headed by Robert Mercer, who was instrumental to Trump’s election and whose other investments include the millions of dollars he has poured into Breitbart News. (Mercer has recently announced he is stepping down from his firm and selling his Breitbart shares to his daughters, citing “personal reasons” for his decision and writing that while he has “great respect” for Breitbart chair Steve Bannon, their political decisions “do not always align.”) Mercer and Sinquefield’s investments, at least, are consistent with their politics. Sterling — and Trump’s immigration policies — also include some who have sought to publicly distance themselves from the president and his anti-immigrant positions. Fink, BlackRock’s chair and CEO, had staked high hopes on a Hillary          Clinton victory. Since the election, Fink has sent mixed messages about his views of Trump, saying that the president’s economic policies represented a “bucket list of things we’d like to see done” — but adding, “You can’t take personality out of the debate.” Despite reservations he might have had about Trump’s “personality,” Fink was one of several executives who rushed to advise him on economic policy by joining the president’s Strategic and Policy Forum. In August, Trump abruptly disbanded the forum and a parallel Manufacturing Jobs Initiative after several members of the latter resigned in protest of his response to the racist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Fink was late to criticize Trump over his remarks and did not publicly declare his intention to resign from the advisory group until the president announced its dissolution. Neither did Dimon, JPMorgan’s CEO and another longtime Democrat donor who had joined Trump’s economic forum. Dimon has been publicly critical of Trump’s immigration policies and opposed his decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which puts 800,000 young people brought to the U.S. as children in limbo and at risk of deportation. (Trump and GOP leaders have indicated they would make funding the wall a condition of extending protections for Dreamers.) “America is and always has been a country of immigrants,” Dimon said in response to Trump’s DACA decision. “And, when people come here to learn, work hard, and give back to their communities, we should allow them to stay in the United States.” In an April letter to shareholders, Dimon also listed “anti-trade and anti-immigration positions” as a liability for banks. “We have always supported proper immigration — it is a vital part of the strength of America,” he wrote, adding that he found the number of skilled immigrants forced to leave the country “alarming.” “We are forcing great talent overseas by not allowing these young people to build their dreams here.” While he never mentioned the wall in the letter, Dimon called Mexico “a long-standing peaceful neighbor” and noted that “there are now more Mexicans going back to Mexico than coming into the United States.” Still, Dimon was careful not to go too hard on the president. His letter to investors never mentioned Trump and at a May meeting with shareholders, he chose diplomacy over a firm rejection. “He is the President of the United States. I believe he is the pilot flying our airplane,” Dimon said. “I would try to help any President of the United States because I’m a patriot.” Most tellingly, as Dimon sought to portray himself as a moderate on          immigration, JPMorgan went from owning zero to 145,200 shares in Sterling — nearly 1 percent of the company. Tim Sloan, president and CEO of Wells Fargo, was also critical of Trump ending DACA, joining tech executives who wrote to the president urging him to protect Dreamers. “Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our economy,” said the letter, which Sloan signed along with more than 800 industry leaders. According to the report, Wells Fargo held 379,278 shares in Sterling — 1.79 percent of the company. Since then, Wells Fargo’s shares have decreased to under 1 percent of the company, while BlackRock, Dimensional, Renaissance Technologies, and JPMorgan have all increased their investment. BlackRock now owns nearly 10 percent of Sterling. BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo did not respond to medianame’s requests for comment. “People like Jamie Dimon and others have been tepid in their rebuttal of Trump’s anti-immigrant policies,” she said. “And they have been tepid because they stand to benefit.” “We think it’s important to smoke them out,” she added. “We can’t allow them to go unnoticed when they are propping up and legitimizing a white nationalist president.” The border wall remains largely unpopular with the public. “[It] is really the only thing that the Trump administration has been pushing concretely in terms of infrastructure,” said Bas. In fact, what’s also getting a boost from Trump’s anti-immigrant policies is the already sprawling private prison industry, with giant prison companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group seeing their value soar amid the continued expansion of immigration detention. BlackRock, Renaissance Technologies, Dimensional, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo all own stock in either CoreCivic or GEO Group. In May, Dimon promised investors he would “look into” JPMorgan’s involvement with private prisons, but since then the bank has increased its stock in both companies. Jonathan Cortés, a member of Make the Road New York, spent more than two months in a CoreCivic detention center where he spent a week without air conditioning in the Arizona summer and where detainees were denied medical care. “It’s so sad to me that the same companies that are financing private immigration detention centers, like the one where I was held in Arizona in terrible conditions, are also putting their money toward Trump’s racist wall project,” he said. “It seems to me that these companies and their CEOs just don’t have a heart — and that, instead of caring about our communities, they prefer to benefit from an anti-immigrant agenda.”</td>\n",

That’s nothing new: Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump has decried the “lawless state of our southern border”—but his administration has repeatedly suspended the law to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico. In less than three years, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has relied on a single federal law, the Real ID Act of 2005, to push aside nearly 50 statutes to put up portions of a border wall. This time around, DHS will disregard a rule that forces contractors to compete for funds (even though Trump campaigned on cutting waste by awarding contracts to the lowest bidder).          Most Americans probably know the Real ID Act as the law that coerced states into adopting stricter standards for driver’s licenses that take effect later this year. But Congress, which passed the statute with large bipartisan majorities, larded it up with massive grants of power to the Department of Homeland Security. Most notably, the act declared that the Secretary of Homeland Security “shall have the authority to waive all legal requirements” that she “determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction” of a border wall. In other words, any DHS secretary seeking to build a wall can cast aside all laws, state and federal, that might stand in her way.          Michael Chertoff, secretary of homeland security under George W. Bush, cited this provision on four occasions to build border fencing. Barack Obama’s DHS secretaries never used it. Trump’s DHS secretaries, by contrast, have cited the Real ID Act over and over again to override dozens of laws protecting the environment, Native American land, historic preservations, national monuments, and archaeological sites. The Sierra Club, which has challenged the wall in court, keeps a running tab of the roughly 50 laws that Trump’s DHS has overridden. So does Kenneth D. Madsen, a professor at Ohio State University, who has laid out each waiver in a dizzying chart.          The consequences of Trump’s rushed construction have already been devastating. A Wall Street Journal investigation found that the wall imperils a mind-boggling array of species. More than 60 percent of species jeopardized by the border wall are already endangered, while 24 percent are threatened. Eighteen types of birds alone, including the bald eagle, will be affected by the wall, as will countless species critical to the region’s biodiversity. The wall has already cut through Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, as well as Quitobaquito Springs, home to an endangered pupfish that lives nowhere else in the world. Trump’s wall replaces previous fencing that was wide enough for animals to pass through. Scientists have found that the wall will wreck migration patterns, bisecting the geographic range of 1,506 native animals and plants, including 62 critically endangered species.          The lives of local communities and tribes will be upended by the wall. The new barrier will cause deadly flooding by trapping debris and turning into a dam that pushes the Rio Grande into border towns. As climate change exacerbates flooding in the region, border towns will suffer immense property damage. Contractors building Trump’s wall have also blasted through sacred Native American sites, including ancient burial grounds where construction crews have found bone fragments.          Since Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned in April 2019, this authority has been exercised by acting secretaries, who did not obtain Senate confirmation to lead the agency. Chad Wolf, the current acting secretary, is thus allowed to set aside any law enacted by the people’s representatives despite never being confirmed to his position by the people’s representatives.          The Supreme Court has never ruled on the merits of this vast delegation of power to an unelected bureaucrat. And Congress’ decision to give a federal agency so much lawmaking authority is the kind of thing that sometimes incenses the conservative justices. But when conservation groups challenged the administration’s authority to waive environmental laws, the lower courts threw out their case, and SCOTUS declined to hear it. The court’s far-right bloc appears eager to let Trump forge ahead with his wall, legal roadblocks be damned. After Congress refused to fund construction, Trump declared a national emergency in 2019, then diverted billions of dollars in military funding to finance the wall. The courts initially halted construction, because federal law bars Trump from transferring money to fund an “item” that Congress already “denied”—and Congress denied funding for the border wall.          In July 2019, however, the Supreme Court issued a 5–4 order allowing Trump to raid military funding and begin building the wall. The majority provided just one sentence of reasoning, declaring that the government had “made a sufficient showing” that the plaintiffs—advocacy groups led by the Sierra Club—had “no cause of action.” This threadbare justification does not even hint that the government acted lawfully. Rather, it suggests that the court’s conservatives do not believe federal law permits anyone to challenge the administration’s misuse of federal funds to build the wall.          The ruling didn’t address the Real ID Act, but once Trump got the green light to pour money into construction, his DHS amped up construction. The border wall is a testament to the president’s ability to sidestep Congress with the help of a pliant Supreme Court. If the southern border is, in fact, lawless, that is because Trump has eliminated the law there.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Catholic Diocese of Brownsville must allow the Trump administration to survey land around the 120-year-old historic La Lomita Chapel to potentially make way for the president’s proposed border wall, a Texas judge determined Wednesday.          But the administration’s seeming victory toward securing land for the wall comes with one major caveat: The pre-border surveying will be under terms set by the diocese.          “Honestly, we expected the judge to rule this way, but we are pleasantly surprised that he allowed the survey to happen on our terms,” Father Roy Snipes, a 73-year-old clergyman who leads a nearby Catholic church, told The medianame on Wednesday. “We are going to continue to fight to ensure the wall isn’t built across our mother church.”          U.S. District Judge Randy Crane ruled Wednesday in the Texas Southern District Court that the government’s access to survey land surrounding the historic “mother” chapel, which sits 800 feet from the southern border, must be negationated by both parties.          Crane did not, however, rule on what would happen if the survey—the first step toward wall construction—determines the church-owned land is necessary to seize for building the barrier.          “As the Diocese recognizes, the more substantial burden—which it believes will violate its right to religious exercise under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act—will come if and when the government seeks to take the property for the building of a wall cutting off La Lomita from those who worship there,” Mary McCord, the diocese’s attorney and a senior litigator for the Georgetown’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, told The medianame on Wednesday.          McCord admitted the decision was expected, and argued in court that the border wall violated the church’s religious freedom by restricting church to La Lomita Chapel.          As previously reported by The medianame, the diocese has called the wall “fundamentally inconsistent with Catholic values” and stated Trump’s plans could limit access to or totally destroy the chapel, which has served as the religious heart of Mission, Texas for more than a century.          In response, the government’s attorneys assured that wall construction would leave the church usable by both Texans and their southern neighbors intact.          “We have no desire to go into the chapel,” the federal attorney said, according to court reporters.          While the border wall may not ultimately disrupt access to the single-room structure in the middle of an open field, Bishop Flores, who has led the diocese since 2009, believes that a wall near the house of worship would be enough to burden the “sanctity of church.”          If the government were to use eminent domain to secure the land around La Lomita, Flories argued, the lights from the 150-foot enforcement zone would be enough to violate religious rights.          “La Lomita has always been known as a safe and welcoming place for everyone, despite their citizenship status, race, gender, or ethnicity,” Flores said. “It hinders the religious freedoms of residents in the area and across the border who may be scared to go through. It ruins the sanctity and purpose of church.”          As one of the five border dioceses, Brownsville’s unique placement next to the Rio Grande could give customs and border-patrol officials the opportunity to monitor and interrogate churchgoers on their immigration status, the diocese argued, thus violating their First Amendment rights.          “Even this temporary access is an intrusion on those using the chapel for prayer,” McCord said. “This is just the first step in our fight to protect the Rio Grande Valley Catholic community’s right to free exercise of religious beliefs.”          McCord anticipates the church and federal officials will begin talks on entry restrictions by the end of the week, where the focus will be on protecting La Lomita to ensure worship at the chapel is not interrupted.          The plea for religious freedom even reached the U.S. Capitol, as three congressman added new language preventing wall funding for protected areas to the Democratic proposal to end last month’s partial government shutdown.          The proposal sought to protect five historical and cultural landmarks, including La Lomita Chapel, by prohibiting any funds for any physical barrier around these sites.          “This is a big win for South Texas,” Congressman Henry Cuellar (D-TX) said in a statement last month. “I worked hard to include this language because I know we can secure the border in a much more effective way, and at a fraction of the cost, by utilizing advanced technology and increasing the agents and properly equipping them on the border.”          Four top Democrats also sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen last month to question the administration’s plan to use eminent domain to seize land from border-town religious groups.          “Eminent domain should not be involved in violation of any religious organization’s First Amendment right of free exercise of religion, Fifth Amendment right to just compensation for any public taking of private property, or the Religious Freedom Restoration act,” the senators wrote.          A DHS spokesperson declined The medianame’s request for comment on whether the agency ever responded to the letter.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                          Mr. Trump has scaled back his initial promise to build a wall along the entire length of the frontier, saying that 1,000 miles of new barriers should suffice. He is pressing to complete nearly half of that by the end of next year, having deputized his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to ride herd on the project.          That’s a tall order given that the government will have to fight court battles with private land owners to take much of the land where the wall would be built. Other impediments include objections arising from the wall’s environmental impact; opposition by congressional Democrats, who are in no mood to appropriate the $5 billion the White House is demanding for the wall in the current fiscal year; and, most recently, a federal court order blocking the administration’s plan to divert $3.6 billion for wall construction from funds approved by Congress for projects on military bases at home and overseas.          Those fights may intensify as the wall’s overall cost, which Mr. Trump once put at $8 billion, turns out to be several times that amount. In the meantime, it’s worth bearing in mind what the wall might and might not achieve.          It might provide an additional deterrent to unauthorized crossing for some migrants not already deterred by policy obstacles the administration has adopted. However, the border wall will not be an impregnable barrier. As medianame’s Nick Miroff wrote last month, Mexican gang members have already figured out that a cordless household tool, available at hardware stores for as little as $100, can slice through the steel-and-concrete bollards from which the new wall will be built.          Nor is it likely to drastically reduce overall numbers of unauthorized migrants in the United States, who for most of the past decade have included many more people who overstay their visas than who cross the border illegally. A report this year by the Center for Migration Studies calculated that about two-thirds of new illegal entries in recent years have been overstays, who now account for more than 40 percent of some 11 million unauthorized immigrants.          The wall is also unlikely to address contraband smuggling, including of heroin and fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid. Most of those substances enter the country through legal ports of entry along the southwest border, hidden in cars and trucks.          The president has convinced many of his supporters that the wall, which Mexico is not paying for, is worth any expense or funding method. The rest of the American public is justified in its skepticism.  \n",

                                                                    Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Wednesday that he has authorized funding to go toward building 20 miles of wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, the latest move inside the Pentagon toward accomplishing President Donald Trump’s long-promised campaign goal.          The Defense Department had earlier approved $2.5 billion toward more than 100 miles of barrier construction requested by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the El Paso, Texas, and Yuma and Tucson, Ariz. sectors. In an unanticipated development — particularly at the Pentagon — the project was more affordable than initially planned.          “The [Army] Corps of Engineers successfully negotiated lower prices than expected, which freed up money to do more miles,” Esper said during his first press conference at the Pentagon. “It was as simple as that.”          Earlier this year, Congress gave Trump funding to build 55 miles of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but Trump declared a national emergency — a move aimed at accessing $6.7 billion in federal funding without receiving Congressional approval. That decision was widely seen as a last-ditch “nuclear option,” and has since sparked legal challenges and rattled the balance of power in the federal government. So far this year, only replacement barrier has been built, not the wall Trump promised on the 2016 campaign trail.          At the Defense Department, officials have played what amounts to a bureaucratic shell game to get money for the wall. The Pentagon took leftover money that had been allocated for military personnel and transferred it into a counter-drug account, a move that gave the military authority to take measures to support federal law enforcement efforts to stop drug trafficking, like building a wall.          The decision is currently being challenged in the courts by the Sierra Club, American Civil Liberties Union and Southern Border Communities Coalition. However, the Supreme Court said last month in a 5-4 vote that wall construction can continue while the federal appeals process plays out.          Esper, just a month after assuming the role of Defense Secretary, may also take another $3.6 billion set for military construction funds — money which is typically intended for housing, maintenance and repair — and funnel it toward Trump’s border wall. Democrats and Republicans alike have lambasted the plan out of fears that projects in their home states will be targeted. At Congress’s request, the Pentagon has sent around a list of construction jobs at-risk, which included more than 400 projects worth about $13 billion.          The U.S. military has been forbidden to take part in domestic law enforcement since the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. Service members can only assist, and that’s exactly what they have done since Trump directed the military to support DHS on the border more than a year ago. The Defense Department has approved multiple DHS requests, including for providing aerial reconnaissance, ground surveillance, search and rescue support, medical support, engineering support, helicopter transportation, personnel protection and other needs.          There are now about 5,700 troops, including 2,000 members of the National Guard, deployed along the southwest border. U.S. troops have welded coils of razor wire atop border fences and points of entry with Mexico in California, Arizona and Texas. They have coated parts of the fence with “anti-climb” paint. They also operate telescopic video cameras, known as “Mobile Surveillance Cameras,” in all nine border Patrol Sectors in each of the four states bordering Mexico. The devices are armed with infrared cameras, enabling troops to watch for illegal border crossings to operate day or night.          As of April, the Pentagon spent a total of $292 million on the deployment, according to a seven-page Defense Department letter sent to Rep. Anthony Brown, a Maryland Democrat, who requested additional information about the mission. The letter estimated the total cost of Pentagon support is at least $431 million through this fiscal year.  \n",
       "2084  Much of the discussion on President Donald Trump’s border wall has focused on its cost and impracticality, as well as the anti-immigrant and racist rhetoric it embodies. Little attention, however, has been paid to who specifically might profit from building the structure. Earlier this year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection chose six companies to build prototypes for the wall in both concrete and “other materials” — and last month they unveiled eight different proposals, the closest this administration has come to fulfilling its signature campaign promise. All but one of the companies that built prototypes are privately held, but a close look at Sterling Construction Company, a publicly traded company based in Texas, suggests that even investors who have distanced themselves from the president’s immigration policies are eager to cash in should the wall actually come to pass. A report on Sterling’s Wall Street investors, published today by a coalition of advocacy groups, warns of the “growing alignment” between the financial elite and the nationalist right-wing, and argues that Trump’s policies are not just a reflection of hard-line nativist ideology, but also of the economic and financial interests of beneficiaries that have largely been able to deflect scrutiny. “Wall Street leaders across the political spectrum have positioned themselves to benefit financially from Trump’s wildly unpopular and expensive border wall,” write the authors of the report. “Their companies’ investments in the wall demonstrate a clear willingness to benefit financially from Trump’s most divisive immigration proposal.” “Lacking from the public narrative is that corporate billionaires stand to gain the most financially,” Nikki Fortunato Bas, executive director of Partnership for Working Families, told medianame. Other groups in the coalition include the Center for Popular Democracy, Make the Road New York, and New York Communities for Change. As the report notes, Sterling’s stock value has already soared by 65 percent since the company was picked to develop a prototype for the wall at the end of August. Estimates for the wall’s cost vary widely, with some reports calculating that it will soar as high as $70 billion (plus $150 million a year in maintenance), others putting the number at $27 billion to $40 billion, and the president promising a much cheaper $12 billion.          This summer, the House of Representatives allocated $1.6 billion to start the wall’s construction — and Trump has promised to shut down the government to secure funding for the rest. “Believe me, if we have to close down our government, we’re building that wall,” he said in August. Last month, the House Homeland Security Committee approved a border security bill that includes $10 billion for the wall. Despite Trump’s repeated claims, that money will come from taxpayers’ pockets, not Mexico. But whatever the final price tag, Wall Street is ready to cash in. While details on the other bidders are harder to get, scrutiny of Sterling’s shareholders reveals that investors across the political spectrum are betting on the wall. Private equity firm BlackRock — headed by longtime Democrat donor Larry Fink — is the largest investor in Sterling, owning nearly 8 percent of its stock as of November 1. Between March and June of this year, as Sterling prepared to bid on the prototype contract, BlackRock increased its investment in the company by 195 percent. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase, whose CEO Jamie Dimon has spoken critically of Trump’s immigration policies, invested in Sterling for the first time over that period. “What a coincidence,” said Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy. “If you look at the investments in this particular company, you see how there is a very clear, intentional positioning to benefit from the building of the wall and by extension, from the policies that criminalize and punish immigrant families and cause tremendous amounts of suffering.” Some of Sterling’s largest investors have made no secret of their ideological alignment with Trump. Two of the firm’s five largest stakeholders are investment firms: Dimensional Fund Advisors LP, whose co-founder Rex Sinquefield is an activist donor to conservative causes and an outspoken opponent of the income tax, and Renaissance Technologies, headed by Robert Mercer, who was instrumental to Trump’s election and whose other investments include the millions of dollars he has poured into Breitbart News. (Mercer has recently announced he is stepping down from his firm and selling his Breitbart shares to his daughters, citing “personal reasons” for his decision and writing that while he has “great respect” for Breitbart chair Steve Bannon, their political decisions “do not always align.”) Mercer and Sinquefield’s investments, at least, are consistent with their politics. Sterling — and Trump’s immigration policies — also include some who have sought to publicly distance themselves from the president and his anti-immigrant positions. Fink, BlackRock’s chair and CEO, had staked high hopes on a Hillary          Clinton victory. Since the election, Fink has sent mixed messages about his views of Trump, saying that the president’s economic policies represented a “bucket list of things we’d like to see done” — but adding, “You can’t take personality out of the debate.” Despite reservations he might have had about Trump’s “personality,” Fink was one of several executives who rushed to advise him on economic policy by joining the president’s Strategic and Policy Forum. In August, Trump abruptly disbanded the forum and a parallel Manufacturing Jobs Initiative after several members of the latter resigned in protest of his response to the racist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Fink was late to criticize Trump over his remarks and did not publicly declare his intention to resign from the advisory group until the president announced its dissolution. Neither did Dimon, JPMorgan’s CEO and another longtime Democrat donor who had joined Trump’s economic forum. Dimon has been publicly critical of Trump’s immigration policies and opposed his decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which puts 800,000 young people brought to the U.S. as children in limbo and at risk of deportation. (Trump and GOP leaders have indicated they would make funding the wall a condition of extending protections for Dreamers.) “America is and always has been a country of immigrants,” Dimon said in response to Trump’s DACA decision. “And, when people come here to learn, work hard, and give back to their communities, we should allow them to stay in the United States.” In an April letter to shareholders, Dimon also listed “anti-trade and anti-immigration positions” as a liability for banks. “We have always supported proper immigration — it is a vital part of the strength of America,” he wrote, adding that he found the number of skilled immigrants forced to leave the country “alarming.” “We are forcing great talent overseas by not allowing these young people to build their dreams here.” While he never mentioned the wall in the letter, Dimon called Mexico “a long-standing peaceful neighbor” and noted that “there are now more Mexicans going back to Mexico than coming into the United States.” Still, Dimon was careful not to go too hard on the president. His letter to investors never mentioned Trump and at a May meeting with shareholders, he chose diplomacy over a firm rejection. “He is the President of the United States. I believe he is the pilot flying our airplane,” Dimon said. “I would try to help any President of the United States because I’m a patriot.” Most tellingly, as Dimon sought to portray himself as a moderate on          immigration, JPMorgan went from owning zero to 145,200 shares in Sterling — nearly 1 percent of the company. Tim Sloan, president and CEO of Wells Fargo, was also critical of Trump ending DACA, joining tech executives who wrote to the president urging him to protect Dreamers. “Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our economy,” said the letter, which Sloan signed along with more than 800 industry leaders. According to the report, Wells Fargo held 379,278 shares in Sterling — 1.79 percent of the company. Since then, Wells Fargo’s shares have decreased to under 1 percent of the company, while BlackRock, Dimensional, Renaissance Technologies, and JPMorgan have all increased their investment. BlackRock now owns nearly 10 percent of Sterling. BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo did not respond to medianame’s requests for comment. “People like Jamie Dimon and others have been tepid in their rebuttal of Trump’s anti-immigrant policies,” she said. “And they have been tepid because they stand to benefit.” “We think it’s important to smoke them out,” she added. “We can’t allow them to go unnoticed when they are propping up and legitimizing a white nationalist president.” The border wall remains largely unpopular with the public. “[It] is really the only thing that the Trump administration has been pushing concretely in terms of infrastructure,” said Bas. In fact, what’s also getting a boost from Trump’s anti-immigrant policies is the already sprawling private prison industry, with giant prison companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group seeing their value soar amid the continued expansion of immigration detention. BlackRock, Renaissance Technologies, Dimensional, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo all own stock in either CoreCivic or GEO Group. In May, Dimon promised investors he would “look into” JPMorgan’s involvement with private prisons, but since then the bank has increased its stock in both companies. Jonathan Cortés, a member of Make the Road New York, spent more than two months in a CoreCivic detention center where he spent a week without air conditioning in the Arizona summer and where detainees were denied medical care. “It’s so sad to me that the same companies that are financing private immigration detention centers, like the one where I was held in Arizona in terrible conditions, are also putting their money toward Trump’s racist wall project,” he said. “It seems to me that these companies and their CEOs just don’t have a heart — and that, instead of caring about our communities, they prefer to benefit from an anti-immigrant agenda.”  "

       "      <td>Opinion | If Congress had any pride, it would set an immigration policy</td>\n",
       "      <td>This pertains to the almost 800,000 “dreamers” in our midst, people who were under age 16 when brought to the United States by parents who were not lawfully residents. Congress has long been unable to address the dreamers’ status by protecting them from the manifestly unjust threat of deportation from the only country they have known.          Barack Obama’s exasperation with the separation of powers, and with the existence of Congress, was even more pronounced than is normal among presidents, especially progressive ones. So he did what he had repeatedly said he lacked the power to do: He made available to these children temporary but renewable legal status and work authorization. He called this an exercise of “prosecutorial discretion.” This was somewhat novel in the size of the class of individuals affected and in affirming a right to work and other federal benefits.          When President Trump rescinded DACA, he denounced it as “an end-run around Congress” that was “unconstitutional,” and his attorney general said it was “effectuated . . . without proper statutory authority.” Never mind the impertinence of this from a president who has declared an “emergency” in order to spend on a border wall money that Congress appropriated for other purposes.          The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which is often in error but never in doubt, acknowledged that presidents have considerable power to undo policies put in place by executive actions of prior administrations. But the court held that the administration’s reasons for rescinding DACA were arbitrary and capricious and hence violated the Administrative Procedure Act.          A brief from Ilya Shapiro and Josh Blackman (who favor DACA as policy) for the Cato Institute argues that Obama’s action went beyond “constitutionally-authorized executive power.” Such power is not enlarged “when Congress refuses to act, no matter how unjustified the congressional inaction is.” There is no constitutional implication from Congress’s passivity in the face of this “foundational transformation of immigration policy,” a transformation “inconsistent with the president’s duty of faithful execution.”          Furthermore, if the Immigration and Nationality Act actually grants to presidents such discretion to rewrite immigration law, then the INA violates the nondelegation doctrine. This forbids Congress to delegate to executive agencies essentially legislative powers regarding “major questions,” which surely encompasses immigration policy.          The Constitution’s first substantive words — the first after the Preamble — are: “All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress.” The Constitution’s Article I, which deals with Congress, is more than twice as long as Article II, which deals with the president and which devotes more words to how presidents shall be selected and removed than it does to everything else about the presidency. The president’s core function is to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” If Congress had even a faint pulse and an ounce of pride, it would take care to enact laws that set immigration policy rather than churning out faux laws that give to presidents discretion tantamount to lawmaking.          The Trump administration’s main reason for rescinding DACA is thoroughly disreputable but entirely permissible — that DACA is bad policy. Another and sufficient reason, however, is that DACA was implemented in accordance with the noxious theory that presidents acquire new constitutional powers by engaging in practices that a lethargic Congress does not challenge. As Cato’s brief says, “The executive branch does not need the judiciary’s permission to cease enforcing a regulation it determines to be unconstitutional. . . . Courts should allow reversals of novel execution actions that expand presidential power.”          If the court allows the administration to withdraw DACA’s humane protections for dreamers, this might embarrass Congress into involving itself in the nation’s governance. And the Trump administration will have (inadvertently) contributed to circumscribing executive power. “Taming the Prince” (the title of Harvard political philosopher Harvey Mansfield’s book on executive power) requires measures “to recage the executive lion” (the words of Saikrishna Bangalore Prakash of the University of Virginia Law School in his upcoming book “The Living Presidency: An Originalist Argument Against Its Ever-Expanding Powers”). Tuesday’s case demonstrates the difficulty of such taming and recaging until Congress remembers the Constitution’s first substantive words.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Bronx lawmaker Jose Serrano: Make NY a sanctuary state</td>\n",
       "      <td>Illegal immigrants would get sanctuary across New York state under a plan being pushed by a Bronx lawmaker, who says the timing is right to expand the controversial policy already in effect in the Big Apple.          Democratic state Sen. Jose Serrano Jr. is sponsoring a bill to prohibit cops from holding non-citizens for deportation by the feds unless they’ve been convicted of serious or violent crimes in the past five years.          In the past, similar proposals never stood a chance of passing the then-GOP-led Senate, but Republicans lost control in last year’s election.          And since Democrats are now in charge of both houses of the Legislature — which is already on the verge of passing a bill to let the state DMV issue driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants — Serrano said he is hopeful of reaching a consensus on his “Dignity for Immigrants in New York State Act.”          “We expect to have a good, robust discussion on the bill,” he told medianame.          Influential Senate Finance Committee Chairwoman Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan) is a co-sponsor of the measure, which was reported to her committee for consideration.          If enacted into law, the Empire State would join California and Connecticut in offering the protection.          State Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn) slammed the proposal as “misguided, dangerous and asinine,” saying it rewarded people for violating the nation’s immigration laws.          “It continues to amaze me that legislators are going to great lengths to make the citizens who elected them less safe,” she said.          But Serrano said the state should adopt his proposal because honoring “detainers” filed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents has a “chilling effect” on the relationship between local cops and illegal immigrants, leading some to avoid reporting crimes or helping investigations for fear of getting thrown out of the country.          He also said the feds have “erroneously” placed detainers on US citizens.          “It leaves the issue of dealing with immigration enforcement to the federal government. Local law enforcement wants to have a good relationship with the immigrant communities,” he said.          A spokeswoman said Gov. Andrew Cuomo was willing to review any legislation to “protect immigrants in New York from the reckless actions taken by ICE.”          Spokeswoman Caitlin Girouard noted that Cuomo, a Democrat, last year “signed an executive order to ban ICE arrests in all executive agencies without a court order and he has now proposed codifying his executive order in legislation to apply it to all public buildings.”          Serrano’s proposal comes amid an ongoing expansion of rights for illegal immigrants, with New York court officials announcing last week that they won’t let ICE agents make arrests in courthouses unless they have a warrant signed by a judge.          Also last week, a federal appeals court in San Francisco unanimously rejected a Trump Administration challenge to the laws that protect illegal immigrants living in California.          Trump has been threatening to send migrants detained at the Mexican border to mostly Democratic sanctuary cities, saying it should make the liberals who live there “very happy.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Supreme Court Allows Trump Admin to Implement ‘Public Charge’ Test for Immigrants</td>\n",
       "      <td>The Supreme Court ruled on Monday to approve the Trump administration’s “public charge” rule for new immigrants.          The justices approved the rule by a vote of 5-4 along ideological lines.          “Public charge” has in recent years been defined as a person dependent on cash assistance programs. The Trump administration updated the definition in August 2019 to include people likely to require non-cash government benefits, and sought to implement a policy limiting the number of new immigrants who would require government assistance such as food stamps or Medicaid.          Lower courts have repeatedly blocked the new policy from going into effect. In early January the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals implemented a nationwide injunction against the policy, which Monday’s Supreme Court decision overrules.          “Throughout our history, self-reliance has been a core principle in America,” then-acting director of U.S. Customs and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli said at a 2019 press conference regarding the new policy. “The virtues of perseverance, hard work, and self-sufficiency laid the foundation of our nation and have defined generations of immigrants seeking opportunity in the United States.”          President Trump has made immigration reform a centerpiece of his agenda, seeking to slow legal immigration and halt illegal immigration to the U.S. In one of the latest developments, on Thursday the State Department announced new guidelines aimed at cracking down on “birth tourism.”          Under the Constitution, babies born in the U.S. receive citizenship even if the parents are foreign citizens visiting the country on a tourist visa. Around 10,000 babies were born to parents of foreign citizens in the U.S. as of 2017, the latest year for which data is available.          Trump has also made construction of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico a priority, diverting funds from the Pentagon to finance the project.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Number of illegal immigrants in US may be twice what's reported: Yale-MIT study</td>\n",
       "      <td>The number of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. could be double what the generally accepted estimate is, according to a study released Friday by researchers from Yale University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.          The U.S. government and most groups put the number of undocumented immigrants at around 11 million to 12 million, but researchers from Yale and MIT give a “conservative” number of 16. 7 million in 2016 and an average of 22 million, according to Yale Insights.          Bloomberg reported the study could validate claims made by President Trump that the real number on undocumented immigrants in the country is as high as 30 million and could offer ammunition for the president and immigration critics to take a harder stance on the issue.          Researchers used data on deportations, border apprehensions and visa overstays along with death rates and immigration rates to arrive at their conclusion. The estimate is based on data from 1990 to 2016.          “Our original idea was just to do a sanity check on the existing number,” said Yale’s Edward Kaplan, who conducted the study with colleague Jonathan Feinstein and MIT’s Mohammad Fazel-Zarandi. “Instead of a number which was smaller, we got a number that was 50 percent higher. That caused us to scratch our heads.”          “There’s a number that everybody quotes,\" Feinstein said, \"but when you actually dig down and say, ‘What is it based on?,’ you find it’s based on one very specific survey and possibly an approach that has some difficulties. So we went in and just took a very different approach.”          But Kaplan said the findings could undercut one of the most common arguments for restricting the flow of immigrants into the country: criminality. He said the data could suggest the crime rate for undocumented immigrants may be even lower than believed.          “You have the same number of crimes but now spread over twice as many people as was believed before, which right away means that the crime rate among undocumented immigrants is essentially half whatever was previously believed,\" he said.          With respect to the notice that undocumented immigrants take jobs away from U.S. citizens, Kaplan said “the fact that there are actually more people here than we thought before might explain that, but you can also look at it the other way: Whatever job displacement there has been happened with twice as many undocumented immigrants as we thought. That causes you to rethink just how much pressure there is.”          The 11.3 million estimate widely cited is based on survey data, researchers wrote.          “The 11.3 million number is extrapolated from the Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey,” MIT’s Fazel-Zarandi said. “It’s been the only method used for the last three decades.”          The findings could add fuel to the already hotly contested immigration debate. However, the researchers said their goal in sifting through the date was not political.          “Of course, our findings will get pulled and tugged in many ways, but our purpose is just to provide better information,” Feinstein said. “This paper is not oriented towards politics or policy. I want to be very clear: This paper is about coming up with a better estimate of an important number.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Joe Biden: Illegal immigrants are ‘already American citizens’ to me</td>\n",
       "      <td>Vice President Joseph R. Biden — already known as a habitual blurter of the near-nonsensical and politically befuddling — may have one-upped himself this week with a somewhat shocking statement on illegal immigrants.          “You know, 11 million people live in the shadows. I believe they’re already American citizens,” Mr. Biden said during a Thursday address to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, The Hill reported. “These people are just waiting, waiting for a chance to contribute fully. And by that standard, 11 million undocumented aliens are already Americans, in my view.”          His statements come as Democrats in the House were this week steadily plodding forward with a bill to reform the nation’s immigration laws and open doors to amnesty.          House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday to the same Hispanic Chamber of Commerce crowd that she wants a bill “desperately” and is ready to work some political trades.          “I want this bill desperately,” she said, The Hill reported. “I’m willing to make almost every compromise possible, but we cannot compromise on a pathway to citizenship. It cannot have a provision that prevents it from happening.”          Mr. Biden also signaled that he wasn’t going to give up on immigration reform, no matter how politically hot the matter became.          “If we want a game changer, the single most important thing we can do for our economy and for America’s future is pass immigration reform now,” he said, The Hill reported. “I’ve heard for too damn long how this was going to bankrupt us, and Social Security was going to take a nosedive and so on. … Well, guess what? It’s a game changer financially for the country.”</td>\n",

       "6              Opinion | If Congress had any pride, it would set an immigration policy  This pertains to the almost 800,000 “dreamers” in our midst, people who were under age 16 when brought to the United States by parents who were not lawfully residents. Congress has long been unable to address the dreamers’ status by protecting them from the manifestly unjust threat of deportation from the only country they have known.          Barack Obama’s exasperation with the separation of powers, and with the existence of Congress, was even more pronounced than is normal among presidents, especially progressive ones. So he did what he had repeatedly said he lacked the power to do: He made available to these children temporary but renewable legal status and work authorization. He called this an exercise of “prosecutorial discretion.” This was somewhat novel in the size of the class of individuals affected and in affirming a right to work and other federal benefits.          When President Trump rescinded DACA, he denounced it as “an end-run around Congress” that was “unconstitutional,” and his attorney general said it was “effectuated . . . without proper statutory authority.” Never mind the impertinence of this from a president who has declared an “emergency” in order to spend on a border wall money that Congress appropriated for other purposes.          The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which is often in error but never in doubt, acknowledged that presidents have considerable power to undo policies put in place by executive actions of prior administrations. But the court held that the administration’s reasons for rescinding DACA were arbitrary and capricious and hence violated the Administrative Procedure Act.          A brief from Ilya Shapiro and Josh Blackman (who favor DACA as policy) for the Cato Institute argues that Obama’s action went beyond “constitutionally-authorized executive power.” Such power is not enlarged “when Congress refuses to act, no matter how unjustified the congressional inaction is.” There is no constitutional implication from Congress’s passivity in the face of this “foundational transformation of immigration policy,” a transformation “inconsistent with the president’s duty of faithful execution.”          Furthermore, if the Immigration and Nationality Act actually grants to presidents such discretion to rewrite immigration law, then the INA violates the nondelegation doctrine. This forbids Congress to delegate to executive agencies essentially legislative powers regarding “major questions,” which surely encompasses immigration policy.          The Constitution’s first substantive words — the first after the Preamble — are: “All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress.” The Constitution’s Article I, which deals with Congress, is more than twice as long as Article II, which deals with the president and which devotes more words to how presidents shall be selected and removed than it does to everything else about the presidency. The president’s core function is to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” If Congress had even a faint pulse and an ounce of pride, it would take care to enact laws that set immigration policy rather than churning out faux laws that give to presidents discretion tantamount to lawmaking.          The Trump administration’s main reason for rescinding DACA is thoroughly disreputable but entirely permissible — that DACA is bad policy. Another and sufficient reason, however, is that DACA was implemented in accordance with the noxious theory that presidents acquire new constitutional powers by engaging in practices that a lethargic Congress does not challenge. As Cato’s brief says, “The executive branch does not need the judiciary’s permission to cease enforcing a regulation it determines to be unconstitutional. . . . Courts should allow reversals of novel execution actions that expand presidential power.”          If the court allows the administration to withdraw DACA’s humane protections for dreamers, this might embarrass Congress into involving itself in the nation’s governance. And the Trump administration will have (inadvertently) contributed to circumscribing executive power. “Taming the Prince” (the title of Harvard political philosopher Harvey Mansfield’s book on executive power) requires measures “to recage the executive lion” (the words of Saikrishna Bangalore Prakash of the University of Virginia Law School in his upcoming book “The Living Presidency: An Originalist Argument Against Its Ever-Expanding Powers”). Tuesday’s case demonstrates the difficulty of such taming and recaging until Congress remembers the Constitution’s first substantive words.\n",

Democratic state Sen. Jose Serrano Jr. is sponsoring a bill to prohibit cops from holding non-citizens for deportation by the feds unless they’ve been convicted of serious or violent crimes in the past five years.          In the past, similar proposals never stood a chance of passing the then-GOP-led Senate, but Republicans lost control in last year’s election.          And since Democrats are now in charge of both houses of the Legislature — which is already on the verge of passing a bill to let the state DMV issue driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants — Serrano said he is hopeful of reaching a consensus on his “Dignity for Immigrants in New York State Act.”          “We expect to have a good, robust discussion on the bill,” he told medianame.          Influential Senate Finance Committee Chairwoman Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan) is a co-sponsor of the measure, which was reported to her committee for consideration.          If enacted into law, the Empire State would join California and Connecticut in offering the protection.          State Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn) slammed the proposal as “misguided, dangerous and asinine,” saying it rewarded people for violating the nation’s immigration laws.          “It continues to amaze me that legislators are going to great lengths to make the citizens who elected them less safe,” she said.          But Serrano said the state should adopt his proposal because honoring “detainers” filed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents has a “chilling effect” on the relationship between local cops and illegal immigrants, leading some to avoid reporting crimes or helping investigations for fear of getting thrown out of the country.          He also said the feds have “erroneously” placed detainers on US citizens.          “It leaves the issue of dealing with immigration enforcement to the federal government. Local law enforcement wants to have a good relationship with the immigrant communities,” he said.          A spokeswoman said Gov. Andrew Cuomo was willing to review any legislation to “protect immigrants in New York from the reckless actions taken by ICE.”          Spokeswoman Caitlin Girouard noted that Cuomo, a Democrat, last year “signed an executive order to ban ICE arrests in all executive agencies without a court order and he has now proposed codifying his executive order in legislation to apply it to all public buildings.”          Serrano’s proposal comes amid an ongoing expansion of rights for illegal immigrants, with New York court officials announcing last week that they won’t let ICE agents make arrests in courthouses unless they have a warrant signed by a judge.          Also last week, a federal appeals court in San Francisco unanimously rejected a Trump Administration challenge to the laws that protect illegal immigrants living in California.          Trump has been threatening to send migrants detained at the Mexican border to mostly Democratic sanctuary cities, saying it should make the liberals who live there “very happy.”\n",

The justices approved the rule by a vote of 5-4 along ideological lines.          “Public charge” has in recent years been defined as a person dependent on cash assistance programs. The Trump administration updated the definition in August 2019 to include people likely to require non-cash government benefits, and sought to implement a policy limiting the number of new immigrants who would require government assistance such as food stamps or Medicaid.          Lower courts have repeatedly blocked the new policy from going into effect. In early January the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals implemented a nationwide injunction against the policy, which Monday’s Supreme Court decision overrules.          “Throughout our history, self-reliance has been a core principle in America,” then-acting director of U.S. Customs and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli said at a 2019 press conference regarding the new policy. “The virtues of perseverance, hard work, and self-sufficiency laid the foundation of our nation and have defined generations of immigrants seeking opportunity in the United States.”          President Trump has made immigration reform a centerpiece of his agenda, seeking to slow legal immigration and halt illegal immigration to the U.S. In one of the latest developments, on Thursday the State Department announced new guidelines aimed at cracking down on “birth tourism.”          Under the Constitution, babies born in the U.S. receive citizenship even if the parents are foreign citizens visiting the country on a tourist visa. Around 10,000 babies were born to parents of foreign citizens in the U.S. as of 2017, the latest year for which data is available.          Trump has also made construction of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico a priority, diverting funds from the Pentagon to finance the project.\n",
       "270    Number of illegal immigrants in US may be twice what's reported: Yale-MIT study                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The number of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. could be double what the generally accepted estimate is, according to a study released Friday by researchers from Yale University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.          The U.S. government and most groups put the number of undocumented immigrants at around 11 million to 12 million, but researchers from Yale and MIT give a “conservative” number of 16. 7 million in 2016 and an average of 22 million, according to Yale Insights.          Bloomberg reported the study could validate claims made by President Trump that the real number on undocumented immigrants in the country is as high as 30 million and could offer ammunition for the president and immigration critics to take a harder stance on the issue.          Researchers used data on deportations, border apprehensions and visa overstays along with death rates and immigration rates to arrive at their conclusion. The estimate is based on data from 1990 to 2016.          “Our original idea was just to do a sanity check on the existing number,” said Yale’s Edward Kaplan, who conducted the study with colleague Jonathan Feinstein and MIT’s Mohammad Fazel-Zarandi. “Instead of a number which was smaller, we got a number that was 50 percent higher. That caused us to scratch our heads.”          “There’s a number that everybody quotes,\" Feinstein said, \"but when you actually dig down and say, ‘What is it based on?,’ you find it’s based on one very specific survey and possibly an approach that has some difficulties. So we went in and just took a very different approach.”          But Kaplan said the findings could undercut one of the most common arguments for restricting the flow of immigrants into the country: criminality. He said the data could suggest the crime rate for undocumented immigrants may be even lower than believed.          “You have the same number of crimes but now spread over twice as many people as was believed before, which right away means that the crime rate among undocumented immigrants is essentially half whatever was previously believed,\" he said.          With respect to the notice that undocumented immigrants take jobs away from U.S. citizens, Kaplan said “the fact that there are actually more people here than we thought before might explain that, but you can also look at it the other way: Whatever job displacement there has been happened with twice as many undocumented immigrants as we thought. That causes you to rethink just how much pressure there is.”          The 11.3 million estimate widely cited is based on survey data, researchers wrote.          “The 11.3 million number is extrapolated from the Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey,” MIT’s Fazel-Zarandi said. “It’s been the only method used for the last three decades.”          The findings could add fuel to the already hotly contested immigration debate. However, the researchers said their goal in sifting through the date was not political.          “Of course, our findings will get pulled and tugged in many ways, but our purpose is just to provide better information,” Feinstein said. “This paper is not oriented towards politics or policy. I want to be very clear: This paper is about coming up with a better estimate of an important number.”\n",

Biden — already known as a habitual blurter of the near-nonsensical and politically befuddling — may have one-upped himself this week with a somewhat shocking statement on illegal immigrants.          “You know, 11 million people live in the shadows. I believe they’re already American citizens,” Mr. Biden said during a Thursday address to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, The Hill reported. “These people are just waiting, waiting for a chance to contribute fully. And by that standard, 11 million undocumented aliens are already Americans, in my view.”          His statements come as Democrats in the House were this week steadily plodding forward with a bill to reform the nation’s immigration laws and open doors to amnesty.          House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday to the same Hispanic Chamber of Commerce crowd that she wants a bill “desperately” and is ready to work some political trades.          “I want this bill desperately,” she said, The Hill reported. “I’m willing to make almost every compromise possible, but we cannot compromise on a pathway to citizenship. It cannot have a provision that prevents it from happening.”          Mr. Biden also signaled that he wasn’t going to give up on immigration reform, no matter how politically hot the matter became.          “If we want a game changer, the single most important thing we can do for our economy and for America’s future is pass immigration reform now,” he said, The Hill reported. “I’ve heard for too damn long how this was going to bankrupt us, and Social Security was going to take a nosedive and so on. … Well, guess what? It’s a game changer financially for the country.”"

       "      <td>Top immigration official says ICE is ready to deport 1 million undocumented immigrants</td>\n",
       "      <td>The Trump administration's top official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said immigration authorities are ready to identify, detain and eventually deport approximately one million undocumented immigrants with pending removal orders.          \"They're ready to just perform their mission, which is to go and find and detain and then deport the approximately one million people who have final removal orders,\" Acting USCIS Director Ken Cuccinelli said on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) branch charged with removal operations.          Cuccinelli, an immigration hardliner who took the helm of the agency last month, said it is within ICE's discretion to determine who among those with final orders of deportation will be targeted in operations, suggesting the full pool of approximately one million immigrants might not face deportation after all.          \"They've been all the way through the due process and have final removal orders. Who among those will be targeted for this particular effort ... is really just information kept within ICE at this point,\" he added. \"The pool of those with final removal orders is enormous.\"          Although he oversees an agency responsible for administering and vetting benefits for immigrants and refugees, Cuccinelli has routinely talked about the tasks of other agencies within DHS — along with lambasting Democrats — on Twitter and television appearances.          The USCIS chief's assertions suggest that ICE is ready to conduct the series of roundups President Trump announced — and later postponed — in June.          Two weeks ago, the president said he would delay a wave of roundups of undocumented families, but threatened to order mass deportations unless congressional Democrats agreed to revamp the nation's asylum laws within two weeks. Efforts to reform the U.S. immigration system have failed under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and there is currently no legislation with sufficient bipartisan support to pass in both chambers of Congress, especially during the timeline Mr. Trump demanded.          On Friday, the president said the roundups would be \"starting fairly soon.\"          Under the operation — which ICE said would send a \"powerful message\" of deterrence to would-be migrants in Central America considering journeying towards the U.S.-Mexico border — authorities had been expected to carry out a series of raids in major U.S. cities to apprehend and deport families who received an order of removal from a judge.          Last month, the president claimed that \"millions\" would be deported under a new wave of operations — something likely to be logistically impossible given the resources and manpower ICE has at its disposal. Last year, ICE removed more than 250,000 people. The highest number of yearly deportations came during the Obama administration in 2012, when the agency removed approximately 410,000 undocumented immigrants.          Any large-scale deportation blitz would also likely spark a massive public outcry and affect not only undocumented immigrants with pending removal orders, but millions of mixed-status families with members who are U.S. citizens.          Cuccinelli, who as the Virginia attorney general and a Republican state lawmaker pushed several anti-immigration positions, said ICE's efforts to remove undocumented immigrants have been \"held up\" and \"interfered\" with by the politics in Washington. He suggested that people should not be surprised about officials carrying out these operations.          \"Here we are talking about ICE doing its job as if it's special, and really this should be going on a rolling basis,\" he said, adding later, \"They're looking forward to just doing their jobs.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Judge orders ICE to release migrant children held with their families, citing coronavirus</td>\n",
       "      <td>Citing new coronavirus cases at detention facilities for migrant families, the federal judge overseeing litigation surrounding protections for undocumented minors in U.S. custody on Friday ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to release children the agency is holding with their parents or legal guardians.          U.S. Judge Dolly Gee of the federal district court in Los Angeles gave ICE a July 17 deadline to release all minors who have been in the agency's custody for more than 20 days. Gee, who oversees the government's compliance with the Flores Settlement Agreement, which governs the care of minors in U.S. immigration custody, cited the first coronavirus cases among the migrant families ICE holds at its three Family Residential Centers, or FRCs.          \"Given the severity of the outbreak in the counties in which FRCs are located and the Independent Monitor and Dr. Wise's observations of non-compliance or spotty compliance with masking and social distancing rules, renewed and more vigorous efforts must be undertaken to transfer (children) residing at the FRCs to non-congregate settings,\" Gee wrote in her order.          \"The FRCs are 'on fire' and there is no more time for half measures,\" she continued.          Gee said ICE has two ways to release minors in its custody before July 17. The agency can release them to other family members if their parents consent to being separated from them. Or ICE can remove families from detention together, allowing them to continue their immigration proceedings within communities in the U.S.          For the latter option, ICE would have to exercise its broad release authority to free the parents, who are not entitled to any of the protections in the Flores Settlement, including its hallmark mandate that the government promptly remove migrant children from custodial settings.          Peter Schey, the co-counsel in the original lawsuit that paved the way for the Flores consent decree, praised Friday's order.          \"We are grateful that the federal court has again stepped into this crisis and ordered the release of all minors to relatives in the U.S. in the next three weeks as long as the parent detained with the child wants their child released,\" Schey wrote in a statement to medianame News. \"Some detained parents facing deportation brought their children to this country to save them from rampant and unchecked violence in their home countries and would prefer to see them released to relatives here rather than being deported along with the parent to countries where children face harm, and sometimes death.\"          But Amy Maldonado, an immigration attorney working on another court case to free all migrant families from detention, said ICE should not ask parents if they wish to be separated from their children.          \"Separating children from their parents is harmful. Not a single parent who is in family detention consents to their child being separated from them. It is never something that the attorneys on the ground at the three non-profits that represent these kids and their parents have agreed or put forth to the government,\" Maldonado told medianame News. \"The only reasonable thing to do is for ICE to release the parents with the children.\"          Maldonado said she and other lawyers representing the families in the separate case in the district court in Washington are considering filing a new motion if ICE does not release parents and children together.          In response to another order from Gee in April, ICE officials recently conducted a parole review of all the children in its custody, but it denied most of their requests for release. Among other reasons, ICE said it did not grant parole to most of the families because the parents did not agree to be separated from their children so the minors could be released to sponsors.          \"A lot of these parents have already been asked if they want to waive their children's rights, and they said 'no,'\" said Alexandra Cohen, the advocacy division supervisor at the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services.          In addition to the 11 coronavirus cases among migrant families at the Karnes detention facility in Texas, more than 2,500 adult ICE detainees have tested positive for COVID-19. Two immigrants have died of coronavirus complications while in the agency's custody.          ICE detains adult immigrants and families with children the government seeks to deport. An order by Gee in 2015 generally prohibited the agency from detaining minors with their families in unlicensed facilities for more than 20 days, barring limited exceptions.          The agency is currently holding approximately 124 children with their parents or legal guardians at three family detention facilities in Texas and Pennsylvania.          In her order Friday, Gee required ICE to provide \"detailed individualized\" explanations if the agency does not release minors who have been held for more than 20 days. Saying that families are named in federal litigation or have pending adjudications by immigration judges or asylum officers would not be \"acceptable explanations,\" she said.          \"For each minor who remains detained at an FRC for more than 20 days, the absence of a suitable sponsor, a parent/guardian's declination of waiver of Flores rights, or a prior unexplained failure to appear at a scheduled hearing would be a satisfactory explanation for continued detention if that explanation is verified in a declaration by an ICE representative under penalty of perjury,\" Gee continued in her order.          Gee also ordered ICE to \"urgently enforce\" measures to contain the spread of coronavirus within the family detention centers. She cited a recent report in which the independent monitor tasked with reviewing ICE's compliance with the Flores agreement said that officials at the two family detention facilities in Texas were not fully enforcing social distancing or mask wearing guidelines.          An ICE spokesperson said Saturday the agency is reviewing Gee's order.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Coronavirus Jailbreak: California Frees Illegal Alien Child Molester</td>\n",
       "      <td>A California federal judge, appointed by former President Jimmy Carter, has mandated the release from prison of six illegal aliens and legal immigrants convicted of child molestation, child abuse, drunk driving, and drug trafficking. United States District Court for the Central District of California Judge Terry Hatter Jr. has ordered the release of six illegal aliens and legal immigrants, the majority of whom have been in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody after felony convictions. Some of these felonies include violent crimes against children. The billionaire George Soros-funded American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) argues that the six illegal aliens and legal immigrants must be released due to fear that they could contract the Chinese coronavirus while in ICE detention. Hatter’s decision in favor of the ACLU sets free:          The ACLU is also suing the federal government on behalf of 13 illegal aliens and legal immigrants in ICE custody who are demanding release into the general public in the midst of the Chinese coronavirus crisis. Already, federal judges in Pennsylvania and New Jersey have ordered the release of about two dozen ICE detainees, and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has asked that all nearly 40,000 ICE detainees be released from federal custody.

       "      <td>Officials accuse DHS chief Kevin McAleenan of leaking ICE raids plan to sabotage operation</td>\n",
       "      <td>This week's big leak about a major Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation was orchestrated by acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan in an effort to sabotage the raids before they were scheduled to take place, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.          In a move he said was to placate Democrats, President Trump announced on Saturday that the nationwide immigration enforcement operation planned to start Sunday — aimed at migrant families who illegally remain in the country despite being denied asylum — was called off to give lawmakers two weeks to work on a plan to fix legal “loopholes” he said have enticed migrants to come to the U.S.          However, all five officials who spoke with the medianame confirmed McAleenan's decision to go rogue and stymie the operation was what prompted the White House to call off the 10-city operation.          The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post on Friday.          The sources said only a small number of people in the White House, ICE, and DHS were even aware of the plan’s details, including which cities, the date and time, and who would be targeted.          Two officials said the acting secretary, who was promoted internally in April, had fought for months during closed-door discussions with White House officials, the former acting ICE Director Ronald Vitiello, and the new acting ICE Director Mark Morgan against the plan, which they noted was similar to one the Obama administration carried out in 2015.          “I know he has not approved of this operation for months,” one person familiar with those private conversations said during a phone call Saturday night. “The president wouldn’t leak that. ICE wouldn’t leak that. There’s only a few people involved in these discussions … The only one who could have shared the details of those operations were Kevin.”          “That’s our belief,” a second official said when asked if McAleenan was behind the leak. “The secretary was not supportive from day one.”          The first official said McAleenan may have leaked it so that he could “be the martyr” in the face of anticipated blowback in the future.          A third official claimed McAleenan “cares more about what liberals and 'Never Trumpers' in Congress and the media think of him the achieving the express mission of his department.”          “[T]his will leave an un-erasable mark on his tenure,” the third official wrote in a text message Saturday evening.          Leaking the information would only have “benefitted one person” who had knowledge of the plan, according to the first person, who added there was “no doubt in my mind” McAleenan either told the Post himself or had a close comrade at DHS take care of it.          “His hands were dirty,” that same official said.          McAleenan traveled with the author of the Post report, Nick Miroff, on a government plane down to the border on Wednesday.          DHS did not respond to a request for comment.          Following the Post report Friday, ICE advised the White House not to go forward with the raids, in part because those who were the targets might have fled the locations Enforcement and Removal Operations officers had expected to find them.          “Leaking the locations and details to stop the operation from happening not only harmed operational integrity, but it put the safety and well-being of his own officers in jeopardy,” the third official wrote.          “That’s law enforcement sensitive information. You just don’t reveal that,” the second official said. “It gets people hyped up. It gets the NGOs activated, and then anyone wearing a jacket with the ICE name on it is really chastised. Cities are coming out saying, ‘Here’s how you can protect yourself against it.’”          That same official said the “worst” consequence of the leak, especially if it was directed by the department’s leader, was how it endangered personnel.          “It really jeopardized the safety of law enforcement officers — that’s the part that’s really detrimental,” the official said.</td>\n",

In recent weeks, ICE started a new joint effort with the Department of Health of Human Services (HHS) to oversee biometric screenings of adults who try to sponsor children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), the agency within HHS that oversees shelters for migrant minors.          ICE spokesperson Bryan Cox told medianame News the inter-agency cooperation, which was not publicly announced, is designed to prevent migrant children in U.S. custody from being placed with sponsors who could be dangerous. He said that HHS, unlike ICE, does not have a mechanism to detect fraudulent documents or a government-run system to conduct background checks on potential sponsors.          \"The intent of the ICE detail was to help decrease these vulnerabilities in HHS screening and vetting procedures, thereby increasing the welfare and safety\" of migrant children in custody, Cox said.          The new initiative, which includes increased sharing of fingerprint and criminal history data, was first reported by The Washington Post. Citing HHS officials, The Washington Post reported that the White House recently tried to install a top ICE official at ORR to oversee the increased information-sharing between the two agencies, but the plan was thwarted by HHS leadership.          Advocates were quick to denounce the initiative, fearing that ICE could be meddling in the internal affairs of America's refugee agency to continue the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants. They noted that ICE has previously tried to use data gathered from undocumented immigrant adults seeking to sponsor children family members with the aim of detaining and deporting them.          \"We must stop these renewed efforts to use HHS data to deport relatives and families of migrant children — it will only result in more trauma and pain for vulnerable children,\" Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas said in a statement to medianame News.          In March 2018, HHS signed a memorandum of agreement with ICE and Customs and Border Protection, agreeing to provide sensitive information about children in its custody, as well as from people who request to sponsor the minors. A report by advocacy groups found that fewer sponsors were coming forward as result of the agreement because they feared that any information they provided to HHS could be used by ICE for immigration enforcement actions against them.          This February, however, House Democrats worked to restrict this through the Homeland Security appropriations bill that became law. They added language designed to limit ICE's ability to go after potential sponsors of children or members of their household.          Castro, who chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, accused White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, one of the architects of the administration's hardline immigration agenda, of being behind the move, which the Texas Democrat said is an attempt to undermine congressional authority.          \"Congress explicitly included a prohibition to prevent ICE from using HHS information to deport sponsors,\" Castro said. \"Nevertheless, Miller is trying to circumvent Congress and create a new crisis at HHS for the sole purpose of inflicting cruelty on immigrants.\"          The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Miller's potential involvement in the effort.          Cox, the ICE spokesperson, said the new initiative is \"fully compliant with the law\" and devised to disqualify individuals with criminality or \"other negative factors\" from sponsoring children in U.S. custody.          The appropriations law passed this year, he added, does not protect immigrants whose sponsorship requests are rejected by HHS, suggesting they could be targeted for detention and removal. HHS has been sharing information about rejected sponsors with ICE, according to Cox.          ICE confirmed the new initiative could cause children to remain in HHS custody for longer periods of time. But the agency said the upshot is more consequential.          \"While improvements in screening, vetting and information sharing may result in a slightly longer length of stay in ORR custody, ensuring the identity of a sponsor and quality of placement should take precedence over speed of placement to what may ultimately be an unsafe environment for\" the child, Cox said.          But Cox also said increased information sharing between the Department of Homeland Security and HHS could allow the refugee agency to find sponsors for children more quickly through Border Patrol data of apprehended family members.          Asked if the information-sharing effort could send a chilling effect to all potential sponsors, particularly those without a legal status who fear enforcement actions by ICE, Cox replied, \"not at all.\"          Potential sponsors who provide accurate information and do not have \"disqualifying factors\" should have \"no reason to be fearful,\" he added.          Under U.S. law, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Border Patrol agents who are usually the first to encounter migrants near the border, is generally required to transfer unaccompanied migrant children in its custody to HHS within 72 hours. The children stay in HHS custody awaiting sponsors, who are typically family members living in the U.S.          Immigration hardliners have often derided the sponsorship process as a \"loophole\" used by undocumented immigrant parents who pay smugglers to help their children travel to the U.S.-Mexico border alone. Trump administration officials have supported proposals to deter immigrants from doing this by sending a message that ICE can detain and deport them if they try to sponsor their children.          But advocates have long argued there should be a barrier between child protection services and immigration enforcement.          There are currently more than 4,000 unaccompanied minors in U.S. custody.          Spokespersons for HHS and ORR did not respond to requests for comment about the new initiative.</td>\n",

Cuccinelli, an immigration hardliner who took the helm of the agency last month, said it is within ICE's discretion to determine who among those with final orders of deportation will be targeted in operations, suggesting the full pool of approximately one million immigrants might not face deportation after all.          \"They've been all the way through the due process and have final removal orders. Who among those will be targeted for this particular effort ... is really just information kept within ICE at this point,\" he added. \"The pool of those with final removal orders is enormous.\"          Although he oversees an agency responsible for administering and vetting benefits for immigrants and refugees, Cuccinelli has routinely talked about the tasks of other agencies within DHS — along with lambasting Democrats — on Twitter and television appearances.          The USCIS chief's assertions suggest that ICE is ready to conduct the series of roundups President Trump announced — and later postponed — in June.          Two weeks ago, the president said he would delay a wave of roundups of undocumented families, but threatened to order mass deportations unless congressional Democrats agreed to revamp the nation's asylum laws within two weeks. Efforts to reform the U.S. immigration system have failed under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and there is currently no legislation with sufficient bipartisan support to pass in both chambers of Congress, especially during the timeline Mr. Trump demanded.          On Friday, the president said the roundups would be \"starting fairly soon.\"          Under the operation — which ICE said would send a \"powerful message\" of deterrence to would-be migrants in Central America considering journeying towards the U.S.-Mexico border — authorities had been expected to carry out a series of raids in major U.S. cities to apprehend and deport families who received an order of removal from a judge.          Last month, the president claimed that \"millions\" would be deported under a new wave of operations — something likely to be logistically impossible given the resources and manpower ICE has at its disposal. Last year, ICE removed more than 250,000 people. The highest number of yearly deportations came during the Obama administration in 2012, when the agency removed approximately 410,000 undocumented immigrants.          Any large-scale deportation blitz would also likely spark a massive public outcry and affect not only undocumented immigrants with pending removal orders, but millions of mixed-status families with members who are U.S. citizens.          Cuccinelli, who as the Virginia attorney general and a Republican state lawmaker pushed several anti-immigration positions, said ICE's efforts to remove undocumented immigrants have been \"held up\" and \"interfered\" with by the politics in Washington. He suggested that people should not be surprised about officials carrying out these operations.          \"Here we are talking about ICE doing its job as if it's special, and really this should be going on a rolling basis,\" he said, adding later, \"They're looking forward to just doing their jobs.\"\n",
       "634   Judge orders ICE to release migrant children held with their families, citing coronavirus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Citing new coronavirus cases at detention facilities for migrant families, the federal judge overseeing litigation surrounding protections for undocumented minors in U.S. custody on Friday ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to release children the agency is holding with their parents or legal guardians.          U.S. Judge Dolly Gee of the federal district court in Los Angeles gave ICE a July 17 deadline to release all minors who have been in the agency's custody for more than 20 days. Gee, who oversees the government's compliance with the Flores Settlement Agreement, which governs the care of minors in U.S. immigration custody, cited the first coronavirus cases among the migrant families ICE holds at its three Family Residential Centers, or FRCs.          \"Given the severity of the outbreak in the counties in which FRCs are located and the Independent Monitor and Dr. Wise's observations of non-compliance or spotty compliance with masking and social distancing rules, renewed and more vigorous efforts must be undertaken to transfer (children) residing at the FRCs to non-congregate settings,\" Gee wrote in her order.          \"The FRCs are 'on fire' and there is no more time for half measures,\" she continued.          Gee said ICE has two ways to release minors in its custody before July 17. The agency can release them to other family members if their parents consent to being separated from them. Or ICE can remove families from detention together, allowing them to continue their immigration proceedings within communities in the U.S.          For the latter option, ICE would have to exercise its broad release authority to free the parents, who are not entitled to any of the protections in the Flores Settlement, including its hallmark mandate that the government promptly remove migrant children from custodial settings.          Peter Schey, the co-counsel in the original lawsuit that paved the way for the Flores consent decree, praised Friday's order.          \"We are grateful that the federal court has again stepped into this crisis and ordered the release of all minors to relatives in the U.S. in the next three weeks as long as the parent detained with the child wants their child released,\" Schey wrote in a statement to medianame News. \"Some detained parents facing deportation brought their children to this country to save them from rampant and unchecked violence in their home countries and would prefer to see them released to relatives here rather than being deported along with the parent to countries where children face harm, and sometimes death.\"          But Amy Maldonado, an immigration attorney working on another court case to free all migrant families from detention, said ICE should not ask parents if they wish to be separated from their children.          \"Separating children from their parents is harmful. Not a single parent who is in family detention consents to their child being separated from them. It is never something that the attorneys on the ground at the three non-profits that represent these kids and their parents have agreed or put forth to the government,\" Maldonado told medianame News. \"The only reasonable thing to do is for ICE to release the parents with the children.\"          Maldonado said she and other lawyers representing the families in the separate case in the district court in Washington are considering filing a new motion if ICE does not release parents and children together.          In response to another order from Gee in April, ICE officials recently conducted a parole review of all the children in its custody, but it denied most of their requests for release. Among other reasons, ICE said it did not grant parole to most of the families because the parents did not agree to be separated from their children so the minors could be released to sponsors.          \"A lot of these parents have already been asked if they want to waive their children's rights, and they said 'no,'\" said Alexandra Cohen, the advocacy division supervisor at the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services.          In addition to the 11 coronavirus cases among migrant families at the Karnes detention facility in Texas, more than 2,500 adult ICE detainees have tested positive for COVID-19. Two immigrants have died of coronavirus complications while in the agency's custody.          ICE detains adult immigrants and families with children the government seeks to deport. An order by Gee in 2015 generally prohibited the agency from detaining minors with their families in unlicensed facilities for more than 20 days, barring limited exceptions.          The agency is currently holding approximately 124 children with their parents or legal guardians at three family detention facilities in Texas and Pennsylvania.          In her order Friday, Gee required ICE to provide \"detailed individualized\" explanations if the agency does not release minors who have been held for more than 20 days. Saying that families are named in federal litigation or have pending adjudications by immigration judges or asylum officers would not be \"acceptable explanations,\" she said.          \"For each minor who remains detained at an FRC for more than 20 days, the absence of a suitable sponsor, a parent/guardian's declination of waiver of Flores rights, or a prior unexplained failure to appear at a scheduled hearing would be a satisfactory explanation for continued detention if that explanation is verified in a declaration by an ICE representative under penalty of perjury,\" Gee continued in her order.          Gee also ordered ICE to \"urgently enforce\" measures to contain the spread of coronavirus within the family detention centers. She cited a recent report in which the independent monitor tasked with reviewing ICE's compliance with the Flores agreement said that officials at the two family detention facilities in Texas were not fully enforcing social distancing or mask wearing guidelines.          An ICE spokesperson said Saturday the agency is reviewing Gee's order.\n",

appointed by former President Jimmy Carter, has mandated the release from prison of six illegal aliens and legal immigrants convicted of child molestation, child abuse, drunk driving, and drug trafficking. United States District Court for the Central District of California Judge Terry Hatter Jr. has ordered the release of six illegal aliens and legal immigrants, the majority of whom have been in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody after felony convictions. Some of these felonies include violent crimes against children. The billionaire George Soros-funded American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) argues that the six illegal aliens and legal immigrants must be released due to fear that they could contract the Chinese coronavirus while in ICE detention. Hatter’s decision in favor of the ACLU sets free:          The ACLU is also suing the federal government on behalf of 13 illegal aliens and legal immigrants in ICE custody who are demanding release into the general public in the midst of the Chinese coronavirus crisis. Already, federal judges in Pennsylvania and New Jersey have ordered the release of about two dozen ICE detainees, and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has asked that all nearly 40,000 ICE detainees be released from federal custody.

       "714  Officials accuse DHS chief Kevin McAleenan of leaking ICE raids plan to sabotage operation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This week's big leak about a major Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation was orchestrated by acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan in an effort to sabotage the raids before they were scheduled to take place, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.          In a move he said was to placate Democrats, President Trump announced on Saturday that the nationwide immigration enforcement operation planned to start Sunday — aimed at migrant families who illegally remain in the country despite being denied asylum — was called off to give lawmakers two weeks to work on a plan to fix legal “loopholes” he said have enticed migrants to come to the U.S.          However, all five officials who spoke with the medianame confirmed McAleenan's decision to go rogue and stymie the operation was what prompted the White House to call off the 10-city operation.          The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post on Friday.          The sources said only a small number of people in the White House, ICE, and DHS were even aware of the plan’s details, including which cities, the date and time, and who would be targeted.          Two officials said the acting secretary, who was promoted internally in April, had fought for months during closed-door discussions with White House officials, the former acting ICE Director Ronald Vitiello, and the new acting ICE Director Mark Morgan against the plan, which they noted was similar to one the Obama administration carried out in 2015.          “I know he has not approved of this operation for months,” one person familiar with those private conversations said during a phone call Saturday night. “The president wouldn’t leak that. ICE wouldn’t leak that. There’s only a few people involved in these discussions … The only one who could have shared the details of those operations were Kevin.”          “That’s our belief,” a second official said when asked if McAleenan was behind the leak. “The secretary was not supportive from day one.”          The first official said McAleenan may have leaked it so that he could “be the martyr” in the face of anticipated blowback in the future.          A third official claimed McAleenan “cares more about what liberals and 'Never Trumpers' in Congress and the media think of him the achieving the express mission of his department.”          “[T]his will leave an un-erasable mark on his tenure,” the third official wrote in a text message Saturday evening.          Leaking the information would only have “benefitted one person” who had knowledge of the plan, according to the first person, who added there was “no doubt in my mind” McAleenan either told the Post himself or had a close comrade at DHS take care of it.          “His hands were dirty,” that same official said.          McAleenan traveled with the author of the Post report, Nick Miroff, on a government plane down to the border on Wednesday.          DHS did not respond to a request for comment.          Following the Post report Friday, ICE advised the White House not to go forward with the raids, in part because those who were the targets might have fled the locations Enforcement and Removal Operations officers had expected to find them.          “Leaking the locations and details to stop the operation from happening not only harmed operational integrity, but it put the safety and well-being of his own officers in jeopardy,” the third official wrote.          “That’s law enforcement sensitive information. You just don’t reveal that,” the second official said. “It gets people hyped up. It gets the NGOs activated, and then anyone wearing a jacket with the ICE name on it is really chastised. Cities are coming out saying, ‘Here’s how you can protect yourself against it.’”          That same official said the “worst” consequence of the leak, especially if it was directed by the department’s leader, was how it endangered personnel.          “It really jeopardized the safety of law enforcement officers — that’s the part that’s really detrimental,” the official said.\n",
       "879       ICE initiative to gather data on sponsors of migrant children fuels fear of crackdown  Washington — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has set up a new information-sharing initiative with the government agency responsible for taking care of unaccompanied migrant minors, sparking fears it will use data to detain and deport immigrant adults who try to sponsor children family members who are in U.S. custody.          In recent weeks, ICE started a new joint effort with the Department of Health of Human Services (HHS) to oversee biometric screenings of adults who try to sponsor children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), the agency within HHS that oversees shelters for migrant minors.          ICE spokesperson Bryan Cox told medianame News the inter-agency cooperation, which was not publicly announced, is designed to prevent migrant children in U.S. custody from being placed with sponsors who could be dangerous. He said that HHS, unlike ICE, does not have a mechanism to detect fraudulent documents or a government-run system to conduct background checks on potential sponsors.          \"The intent of the ICE detail was to help decrease these vulnerabilities in HHS screening and vetting procedures, thereby increasing the welfare and safety\" of migrant children in custody, Cox said.          The new initiative, which includes increased sharing of fingerprint and criminal history data, was first reported by The Washington Post. Citing HHS officials, The Washington Post reported that the White House recently tried to install a top ICE official at ORR to oversee the increased information-sharing between the two agencies, but the plan was thwarted by HHS leadership.          Advocates were quick to denounce the initiative, fearing that ICE could be meddling in the internal affairs of America's refugee agency to continue the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants. They noted that ICE has previously tried to use data gathered from undocumented immigrant adults seeking to sponsor children family members with the aim of detaining and deporting them.          \"We must stop these renewed efforts to use HHS data to deport relatives and families of migrant children — it will only result in more trauma and pain for vulnerable children,\" Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas said in a statement to medianame News.          In March 2018, HHS signed a memorandum of agreement with ICE and Customs and Border Protection, agreeing to provide sensitive information about children in its custody, as well as from people who request to sponsor the minors. A report by advocacy groups found that fewer sponsors were coming forward as result of the agreement because they feared that any information they provided to HHS could be used by ICE for immigration enforcement actions against them.          This February, however, House Democrats worked to restrict this through the Homeland Security appropriations bill that became law. They added language designed to limit ICE's ability to go after potential sponsors of children or members of their household.          Castro, who chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, accused White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, one of the architects of the administration's hardline immigration agenda, of being behind the move, which the Texas Democrat said is an attempt to undermine congressional authority.          \"Congress explicitly included a prohibition to prevent ICE from using HHS information to deport sponsors,\" Castro said. \"Nevertheless, Miller is trying to circumvent Congress and create a new crisis at HHS for the sole purpose of inflicting cruelty on immigrants.\"          The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Miller's potential involvement in the effort.          Cox, the ICE spokesperson, said the new initiative is \"fully compliant with the law\" and devised to disqualify individuals with criminality or \"other negative factors\" from sponsoring children in U.S. custody.          The appropriations law passed this year, he added, does not protect immigrants whose sponsorship requests are rejected by HHS, suggesting they could be targeted for detention and removal. HHS has been sharing information about rejected sponsors with ICE, according to Cox.          ICE confirmed the new initiative could cause children to remain in HHS custody for longer periods of time. But the agency said the upshot is more consequential.          \"While improvements in screening, vetting and information sharing may result in a slightly longer length of stay in ORR custody, ensuring the identity of a sponsor and quality of placement should take precedence over speed of placement to what may ultimately be an unsafe environment for\" the child, Cox said.          But Cox also said increased information sharing between the Department of Homeland Security and HHS could allow the refugee agency to find sponsors for children more quickly through Border Patrol data of apprehended family members.          Asked if the information-sharing effort could send a chilling effect to all potential sponsors, particularly those without a legal status who fear enforcement actions by ICE, Cox replied, \"not at all.\"          Potential sponsors who provide accurate information and do not have \"disqualifying factors\" should have \"no reason to be fearful,\" he added.          Under U.S. law, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Border Patrol agents who are usually the first to encounter migrants near the border, is generally required to transfer unaccompanied migrant children in its custody to HHS within 72 hours. The children stay in HHS custody awaiting sponsors, who are typically family members living in the U.S.          Immigration hardliners have often derided the sponsorship process as a \"loophole\" used by undocumented immigrant parents who pay smugglers to help their children travel to the U.S.-Mexico border alone. Trump administration officials have supported proposals to deter immigrants from doing this by sending a message that ICE can detain and deport them if they try to sponsor their children.          But advocates have long argued there should be a barrier between child protection services and immigration enforcement.          There are currently more than 4,000 unaccompanied minors in U.S. custody.          Spokespersons for HHS and ORR did not respond to requests for comment about the new initiative."

       "      <td>Can anyone imagine a major newspaper running an op-ed justifying public ignorance on public policy? Actually, not merely justifying the ignorance, but rather arguing that facts only help smother discourse rather than enhance it. It’s improbable. Then again, this is the gun debate. And one side benefits from policy illiteracy.          The Washington Post ran an op-ed by former Gawker writer Adam Weinstein arguing that Second Amendment advocates use “jargon” to bully gun-control supporters. “While debating the merits of various gun control proposals,” he contends, “Second Amendment enthusiasts often diminish, or outright dismiss their views if they use imprecise firearms terminology.”          How dare Second Amendment advocates expect that those passionately arguing to limit their constitutional rights have some rudimentary knowledge of the devices they want to ban? To point out the constant glaring technical and policy “faux pas” of gun controllers, he argues, is to engage in “gunsplaining,” a bad-faith argument akin to intimidation.          “If you don’t know what the ‘AR’ in AR-15 stands for, you don’t get to talk” explains the sarcastic subhead. If you don’t know what the “AR” in AR-15 stands you still get to talk. But if you want to ban or confiscate AR-15s and you haven’t taken the time to learn what the AR stands for, then gun owners have every right to call you out.          Weinstein bemoans the unfairness of gun controllers “being forced to sweat the finest taxonomic distinctions between our nation’s unlimited variety of lethal weapons.” This statement is illustrative of the emotionalism and hyperbole of the debate (the notion that there’s an “unlimited variety” of firearms is absurd) but also, at the same time, it’s an exaggeration of the Second Amendment advocate’s expectations.          Like with any contemporary disputes over public policy, there will always be those who attempt to dismiss opponents who possess less expertise. It’s certainly not unique to this debate. And no, simply because a person refers to a “bullet” rather than a “cartridge” or “clip” rather than a “magazine” should not mean exclusion from conversation.          Then again, much of gun-control policy is driven by the mechanics of a firearm. So while not knowing what a “barrel shroud” is should not prevent anyone from pondering gun policy (well, unless you’re a politician who goes on TV to advocate the banning of barrel shrouds without knowing what they are), failing to understand the distinction between a semi-automatic and automatic weapon tells us you’re either dishonest, unserious or unprepared for the debate.          In a debate imbued with emotion, gun-control advocates rely on this ignorance. When Barack Obama tells a crowd that a mass shooter used a “fully automatic weapon,” he’s not concerned with the finest taxonomic distinctions of a gun, he’s depending on the yawning obliviousness of a cheering crowd. When CNN featured an alleged gun expert explaining that the AR-15 he’s about to fire is “full semi-automatic,” he’s making the functionality of firearm sound scarier to those who are ignorant about guns.          “Jargon” are words and expressions that are difficult for a layman to understand or use. Rather than use jargon, Second Amendment advocates are usually mocking those who use jargon-y sounding words in efforts to fearmonger viewers and constituents. When you claim that the streets are rife with “high-capacity, rapid-fire magazines” or “jumbo clips” you’re trying to fool your audience with a veneer of expertise you don’t possess. When you claim that we need to ban “gas-assisted, receiver firearms” you’re trying to make a semi-automatic weapon sound like a machine gun for a reason.          It’s not always the mechanics, either. When Joe Scarborough misrepresents the Heller decision, he’s preying on policy ignorance that has little to do with gun culture. When Steve Schmidt goes on television and passionately tells an audience that it’s more difficult to buy cough medicine than an “AK-47 – or 50 of them,” he’s either lying or he has absolutely no grasp of how gun policy works. Either way, he shouldn’t be talking to grownups about firearms.          All these people use a moralistic fallacy, which is often predicated on the ignorance Weinstein rationalizes. Not that it stops him from embracing the appeal to authority he condemns elsewhere.          For example, Weinstein takes Fox News personality Tomi Lahren to task for failing to mention that “the family” of Eugene Stoner, the AR-15’s designer and champion, claimed in 2016 that the inventor would be “horrified and sickened to see his military rifle pattern become so common in civilian households and school shootings.” You’ll notice the conflation. Of course Stoner would be horrified that his gun was used in school shootings. But Weinstein fails to note that there’s no evidence anywhere on the record that Stoner was “horrified and sickened” by the notion of civilians owning his gun. Since he was selling proto AR-15s to civilians a decade before his military model was adopted by the United States, we have no reason to believe he would be.          Perhaps that kind of discussion spurns conversation in favor of condescension. But at least it’s a debate that revolves around the veracity of facts. Which is a lot more I can say for the rest of the “gunsplaining” grievance.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Analysis | Marco Rubio’s claim that no recent mass shootings would have been prevented by gun laws</td>\n",
       "      <td>“None of the major shootings that have occurred in this country over the last few months or years that have outraged us, would gun laws have prevented them.”          A colleague pointed out this statement by Marco Rubio as a possible fact check, suggesting that it was almost certainly incorrect. It posed an interesting challenge, given the reams of data to examine.          The Fact Checker obviously takes no position on proposed gun-control laws. But given the attention of recent mass public shootings, is Rubio correct that none of the major shootings in recent years would have been prevented by new gun laws?          Rubio was not specific in his time frame — and a spokesman declined to elaborate — but for the purposes of this fact check we will go back as far as the Newtown shooting in 2012, which touched off the current gun debate.          First of all, we should note that there is an unbridgeable gap in opinion about efficacy of various gun proposals, particularly regarding assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.          “The common thread that binds most mass shootings is semiautomatic firearms with the ability to accept a high-capacity detachable ammunition magazine,” said Avery Palmer, communications director at the Violence Policy Center, which supports restrictions on guns. “These can range from assault rifles, pistols, and shotguns, to compact, high-capacity pistols marketed for concealed carry. Today’s gun industry has embraced increased lethality as its marketing lodestar, and one key element in reducing the occurrence and severity of mass shootings lies in ratcheting down the firepower in civilian hands.”          By contrast, gun-rights supporters argue that bans on certain weapons and large-capacity magazines would accomplish little. There are already more than 5 million AR-type rifles in circulation in the United States, ownership of which would have been grandfathered under proposed bans.          A previous nationwide assault-weapons ban, which lasted 10 years and lapsed in 2004, was easily circumvented by gun manufacturers, in part because of various loopholes. The evidence is mixed on how effective that ban was, with both sides often cherry-picking from the most comprehensive report on that law, written in 2004 by Christopher Koper of George Mason University. “The ban did not appear to affect gun crime during the time it was in effect, but some evidence suggests it may have modestly reduced gunshot victimizations had it remained in place for a longer period,” Koper wrote in 2013.          John R. Lott Jr., at the pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center, notes that such bans would target .223-caliber weapons but would not affect more powerful semiautomatic rifles using .30-06 caliber, which are used for hunting deer. (This video demonstrates the difference.)          Meanwhile, an experienced shooter, as shown in this video, can change a magazine in just two to four seconds. That calls into question whether such a ban would significantly reduce the death toll.          A new study by Gary Kleck of Florida State University studied news accounts of 23 shootings between 1994 and 2013 in which more than six people were killed or wounded and large-capacity magazines were used. In only one case was a shooter stopped as he tried to reload. In all of these 23 incidents, the shooter possessed either multiple guns or multiple magazines, indicating that a determined shooter would not have been deterred by smaller magazines.          Now let’s look at the facts behind Rubio’s statement. Is there evidence that gun law proposals would have prevented the recent high-profile mass shootings?          We developed the following list of 12 mass shootings since 2012 catalogued in the Mother Jones database of U.S. mass shootings, with details obtained from various news and official reports. We will look at whether proposals might have made a difference in how the guns were obtained, or whether existing laws worked as intended.          Dec. 2, 2015: Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., using a Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P AR-15 type rifle, a DPMS Panther Arms AR-15 type rifle, a Smith &amp; Wesson semiautomatic pistol and a Llama semiautomatic pistol. The guns were purchased legally and the rifles were purchased legally by a former neighbor. (The transfer of the rifles to the suspects may have violated California and federal laws.) Four high-capacity magazines were found, perhaps holding as many as 30 rounds.          Oct. 1, 2015: Christopher Harper-Mercer killed nine people at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. He owned 14 firearms and conducted the attack with six of them, including a Glock pistol, a Smith &amp; Wesson pistol, a Taurus pistol and a Del-Ton AR-15 rifle. All were purchased legally.          July 16, 2015: Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez killed five people and wounded two at the Navy Operational Support Center and Marine Corps Reserve Center in Chattanooga, Tenn. He used an AK-47-style rifle and 9mm handgun, and a shotgun was in his car. He had multiple 30-round magazines, news reports said. Officials said the gun was obtained legally; other weapons were obtained through Armslist.com, an online forum through which individuals can buy and sell firearms through private transactions.          June 17, 2015: Dylann Roof killed nine people with a .45-caliber Glock pistol that held 13 rounds at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C. Roof legally purchased his gun from a store, but the FBI said he should have failed the background check because he had been charged with possessing Suboxone without a prescription. However, because of clerical mistakes, the FBI said the examiner did not get hold of the report before the three-day waiting period ended, and so the store went through with the purchase.          Oct. 24, 2014: Jaylen Ray Fryberg, a teenager, killed four students with a high-capacity Beretta pistol at the Marysville-Pilchuck High School cafeteria in Marysville, Wash. The pistol belonged to his father, who was the subject of a permanent protection order. That should have prevented the purchase of the gun, but the order had not been entered in the system and so his father passed the background check. The father was later found guilty of knowingly purchasing six firearms he could not legally possess.          Feb. 20, 2014: Cherie Lash Rhoades killed four people and wounded two at the Cedarville Rancheria Tribal Office and Community Center in Alturas, Calif. She used a 9mm semiautomatic handgun and stabbed a person with a butcher knife when a second gun apparently jammed. It isn’t clear how the gun was obtained; her trial has not taken place. (Note: Rhoades killed her brother, niece, nephew and another tribal member, so some might say this is a family dispute, not a mass public shooting.)          Sept. 16, 2013: Aaron Alexis, who had been treated for mental health issues but never committed, killed 12 people with a Remington shotgun at the Washington Navy Yard. He had tried to buy a handgun at a Virginia store but changed his mind after he was told it would have to be delivered to his home state through another federally licensed dealer. But he was able to purchase a shotgun. He passed state and federal background checks; he had been arrested three times but not convicted.          July 26, 2013: Pedro Vargas set fire to his apartment in Hialeah, Fla., and killed six people with a Glock 17 9mm semiautomatic handgun. Vargas bought his handgun legally and had a concealed weapons permit. (Note: Most of the deaths took place in an apartment complex, not a public space, so some say this should not be considered a public shooting.)          June 7, 2013: John Zawahri killed five people in Santa Monica, Calif., using a .223 semiautomatic rifle, similar in type to an AR-15. He also had multiple 30-round magazines — which are illegal in California — and during the rampage had dropped a bag which contained additional loaded magazines, a handgun and the upper receiver for a semiautomatic rifle. He also appeared to have made some weapons that are illegal. Investigators later found a 2011 letter from the Department of Justice informing Zawahri that he was not eligible to purchase a firearm.          April 21, 2013: Dennis Clark III shot and killed his girlfriend in their apartment in Federal Way, Wash., and then killed three other people using a .40-caliber Taurus semiautomatic pistol and a pistol-grip Mossberg 500 pump shotgun with a four-round saddle. The weapons were obtained legally, and he had a concealed pistol license.          March 13, 2013: Kurt Myers killed four people and wounded two with a shotgun in neighboring towns in Herkimer County, N.Y. The shotgun apparently was obtained legally.          Dec. 14, 2012: Adam Lanza killed his mother in their home with a Savage Mark II .22-caliber rifle and then killed 26 people, mostly children, with a Bushmaster XM-15 rifle (with a 30-round magazine) at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. His weapons, which also included handguns and a 12-gauge semiautomatic shotgun, were found in Lanza’s car outside the school and had been legally obtained by his mother, a gun enthusiast. Lanza, in effect, stole his mother’s firearms.          This is certainly a depressing chronicle of death and tragedy. But Rubio’s statement stands up to scrutiny — at least for the recent past, as he framed it. Notably, three of the mass shootings took place in California, which already has strong gun laws including a ban on certain weapons and high-capacity magazines.          Gun-control advocates often point to the experience in other countries that have enacted gun laws that heavily restrict gun ownership; as we have shown, quantitative measures of cross-comparative crime statistics, especially where the crime is not consistently defined (i.e., “mass shooting”), usually end up being apples-to-oranges comparisons. It is possible that some gun-control proposals, such as a ban on large-capacity magazines, would reduce the number of dead in a future shooting, though the evidence for that is heavily disputed. But Rubio was speaking in the past, about specific incidents. He earns a rare Geppetto Checkmark.

       "      <td>Republicans Blocked A Gun Control Bill During Another School Shooting</td>\n",
       "      <td>WASHINGTON — Sen. Chris Murphy attempted to pass a gun control package Thursday morning, watched it get blocked by Republicans, and then gave a speech about the need to do something about the regular mass shootings in America. He didn’t know until he walked out that another mass shooting had just happened, this time at a high school in California.          “I found out as soon as I walked off the floor,” Murphy told medianame News.          Two students were killed and several others were injured when a 16-year-old went on a shooting spree at a school in Santa Clarita on Thursday morning.          Murphy had asked for the Senate to unanimously agree to pass universal background checks for firearms, as he’s done repeatedly for months. “The American public are not going to accept silence from the body week after week, month after month in the face of this epidemic carnage that is happening in this country,” he said.          But even after news of the shooting spread through the Senate — Sen. Richard Blumenthal found out via a note from a staffer while he was giving a speech about gun violence — Murphy said he doesn’t believe it will change anything.          “I wish this weren’t the case, but Republicans’ interest in working on guns is driven by casualties of 15 or more. It’s so awful that it works like this,” he said. “I don’t doubt that we’ll be back in a conversation about background checks, but it probably won’t happen until there’s another epic-scale shooting.”          Some Republicans have long opposed the bill, arguing that universal background checks violate Second Amendment rights. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, the Republican who objected to Murphy trying to get a vote on the bill Thursday morning, argued that the legislation “should not be fast-tracked by the Senate.”          “Many questions about this legislation need to be answered before it’s forced upon law-abiding gun owners,\" Hyde-Smith said.          In September, House Democrats advanced three additional gun bills following mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, which left a total of 31 people dead. There was also momentum toward a bipartisan gun control package negotiated with the White House.          But Murphy said he hadn’t heard from the Trump administration about background checks since September.          Lindsey Graham, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said there is bipartisan support for one part of a gun control package — a grant program that encourages states to set up “red flag” programs that allow law enforcement officers to preemptively seize a person’s firearms if they are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. But he said progress on background checks has stalled, and blamed, in part, the House impeachment inquiry.          “Impeachment has sucked all the oxygen out. But I hope we will revisit. I really do. I am ready to do something yesterday,” said Graham.          The House passed universal background checks in late February. The bill received bipartisan support with eight Republicans crossing the aisle to vote for the legislation. Since then, universal background checks have remained stalled in the Republican-led Senate at the behest of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.          Attorney General Bill Barr blamed the House impeachment hearings for derailing the progress on gun control during an event in Tennessee on Wednesday. But Murphy refuted those claims Thursday morning.          “That’s not true,” Murphy said, addressing Barr’s comments on the Senate floor. “The impeachment proceedings right now are in the House of Representatives; the discussion on the future of the background checks bill was in the Senate.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>New Zealand Gun Buyback Was An ‘Unmitigated Failure’</td>\n",
       "      <td>Many New Zealand gun owners have refused to participate in a mandatory buyback program of military-style semi-automatic weapons implemented after the Christchurch massacre in March.          Despite a penalty of up to five years in prison, up to two-thirds of firearms banned by the legislation were not turned in before the Friday deadline by New Zealand gun owners, the Washington Post reported.          While 47,000 semi-automatic rifles have been collected, according to police statistics, a government commissioned study determined that the small nation likely contains between 56,000 and 170,000 now banned weapons, according to 1 News.          New Zealand’s largest gun rights advocacy group, the Licensed Firearms Owners Council, remarked that the buyback program has been an “unmitigated failure.”          Police Minister Stuart Nash blamed the government’s inability to enforce its buyback scheme on a lack of gun registration. “The problem is we just don’t know exactly how many guns are out in the community, this is why we need a register, to enable Police to better track firearms,” he said, according to 1 News.          On March 15, 2019, a right-wing extremist opened fire on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand during Friday prayer, killing 51 worshipers and injuring 49 others. As a result of this terrorist attack, New Zealand’s parliament quickly passed legislation to ban all weapons similar to the ones used by the shooter.          When it was first proposed, New Zealand’s plan to confiscate military-style weapons was praised by members of the American left. Several Democratic presidential candidates, most notably New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, have been vocal with their support for similar programs. (RELATED: Bernie Sanders Discovers Second Amendment Rights)          However, some experts said that the failure of New Zealand’s confiscation efforts bode poorly for similar programs proposed in the United States.          “The great majority of American rifles and handguns are semi automatic. I can’t imagine American gun owners going along with this [buybacks], even to the modest level of compliance that New Zealand seems to have gotten,” Eugene Volokh, a legal scholar from the University of California, told the Post.          The Post also noted how the vast majority of New Zealanders support more gun control, and that the country lacks constitutional protections for the right to bear arms — unlike the U.S.</td>\n",

       "      <td>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - When Pennsylvania lawmakers were rushing to wrap up the session’s business in June, aides to state Attorney General Josh Shapiro came to them with a request: expand the office’s authority to pursue gun-trafficking crimes across the state.          The idea was to insert the measure into a fast-tracked bill dealing with drug crimes. But the request - to give the office statewide jurisdiction to prosecute illegal gun possession, sales and transfers - got put aside for the summer amid objections, apparently revolving around law-enforcement turf and gun politics.          “It didn’t take long to become apparent that the statewide jurisdictional change was going to cause far too many problems with legislation that had to get done,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rob Kauffman, who was in charge of shepherding the bill.          Calls to respond to gun violence in Pennsylvania have only grown since then, coming to a head in mid-August when a man with a long criminal record - which barred him from legally possessing firearms - allegedly shot and wounded six Philadelphia police officers during a standoff.          Still, it’s unclear whether the provision has any chance of becoming law in the Republican-controlled Legislature after lawmakers return to session in September.          Under current law, the attorney general’s office cannot prosecute gun-trafficking cases without a referral from a district attorney.          Shapiro’s aides point to the success of a joint gun-violence task force that, since 2006, has stationed state gun-trafficking agents in Philadelphia and personnel in the Philadelphia district attorney’s office to prosecute those cases.          The attorney general’s office could use the authority to offer similar help to police departments and district attorneys in other counties, Shapiro’s aides said, and track gun-trafficking pipelines across the state.          It’s not necessarily novel: The attorney general’s office already has legal authority to prosecute various crimes without a district attorney’s referral, including human trafficking and narcotics.          After receiving the request, House Judiciary Committee staff checked with a short list of law enforcement organizations and gun-rights groups to see if they would support the idea, said Kauffman, R-Franklin.          Not all of them did.          Kauffman would not say exactly who objected to it, or describe specific objections, although he acknowledged discomfort from gun-rights proponents.          “I would say that generally our second amendment advocates do have concern with folks they perceive as anti-gun proposing or attempting to infringe on their rights through additional laws,” Kauffman said.          Shapiro, a Democrat who is widely viewed as a future candidate for governor, backs various bills that gun-rights groups have tended to oppose, such as an expansion of background checks to private sales of shotguns, sporting rifles and semi-automatic rifles.          Rep. Jared Solomon, D-Philadelphia, a lead supporter of expanding the attorney general’s authority to enforce gun-trafficking laws, said Judiciary Committee staff told him that the NRA opposed the provision.          “The NRA will tell you they want to enforce the laws on the books, so what did we do? We give them a vehicle to do just that, which is to enforce the laws on the books, which is to provide more resources to that end. And they said, ‘No,’” said Solomon.          An NRA spokeswoman countered that the organization took no position on the bill, and said it routinely calls for the enforcement of existing gun laws.          “Criminals should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and we take no position on who should do the prosecuting,” NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter said in a statement.          Kim Stolfer, chairman of the Pennsylvania-based gun-rights group, Firearms Owners Against Crime, said he told Judiciary Committee staff that he had no problem with the idea.          “If you commit a crime with a firearm, you should pay a price and we’re not doing that,” Stolfer said.          The state Fraternal Order of Police lodge and the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association said they had not been asked for an official position.          But the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association, which represents 66 of the state’s 67 county prosecutors, had objections. Its director of legislation and policy, Greg Rowe, said the association would support the measure only with certain parameters: giving a district attorney the “right of first refusal” to prosecute the case or linking the jurisdiction to a joint task force.          Rowe said he didn’t hear back from the committee after he pitched the counterproposal.          Shapiro’s aides, meanwhile, said they had had conflicting reports about who objected.          “We heard first that, ‘Yep, we’re in good shape, everyone’s good with this,’” said David Wade, Shapiro’s chief of staff. “And then we heard, ‘Change in plans, this isn’t going.’”</td>\n",

an op-ed justifying public ignorance on public policy? Actually, not merely justifying the ignorance, but rather arguing that facts only help smother discourse rather than enhance it. It’s improbable. Then again, this is the gun debate. And one side benefits from policy illiteracy.          The Washington Post ran an op-ed by former Gawker writer Adam Weinstein arguing that Second Amendment advocates use “jargon” to bully gun-control supporters. “While debating the merits of various gun control proposals,” he contends, “Second Amendment enthusiasts often diminish, or outright dismiss their views if they use imprecise firearms terminology.”          How dare Second Amendment advocates expect that those passionately arguing to limit their constitutional rights have some rudimentary knowledge of the devices they want to ban? To point out the constant glaring technical and policy “faux pas” of gun controllers, he argues, is to engage in “gunsplaining,” a bad-faith argument akin to intimidation.          “If you don’t know what the ‘AR’ in AR-15 stands for, you don’t get to talk” explains the sarcastic subhead. If you don’t know what the “AR” in AR-15 stands you still get to talk. But if you want to ban or confiscate AR-15s and you haven’t taken the time to learn what the AR stands for, then gun owners have every right to call you out.          Weinstein bemoans the unfairness of gun controllers “being forced to sweat the finest taxonomic distinctions between our nation’s unlimited variety of lethal weapons.” This statement is illustrative of the emotionalism and hyperbole of the debate (the notion that there’s an “unlimited variety” of firearms is absurd) but also, at the same time, it’s an exaggeration of the Second Amendment advocate’s expectations.          Like with any contemporary disputes over public policy, there will always be those who attempt to dismiss opponents who possess less expertise. It’s certainly not unique to this debate. And no, simply because a person refers to a “bullet” rather than a “cartridge” or “clip” rather than a “magazine” should not mean exclusion from conversation.          Then again, much of gun-control policy is driven by the mechanics of a firearm. So while not knowing what a “barrel shroud” is should not prevent anyone from pondering gun policy (well, unless you’re a politician who goes on TV to advocate the banning of barrel shrouds without knowing what they are), failing to understand the distinction between a semi-automatic and automatic weapon tells us you’re either dishonest, unserious or unprepared for the debate.          In a debate imbued with emotion, gun-control advocates rely on this ignorance. When Barack Obama tells a crowd that a mass shooter used a “fully automatic weapon,” he’s not concerned with the finest taxonomic distinctions of a gun, he’s depending on the yawning obliviousness of a cheering crowd. When CNN featured an alleged gun expert explaining that the AR-15 he’s about to fire is “full semi-automatic,” he’s making the functionality of firearm sound scarier to those who are ignorant about guns.          “Jargon” are words and expressions that are difficult for a layman to understand or use. Rather than use jargon, Second Amendment advocates are usually mocking those who use jargon-y sounding words in efforts to fearmonger viewers and constituents. When you claim that the streets are rife with “high-capacity, rapid-fire magazines” or “jumbo clips” you’re trying to fool your audience with a veneer of expertise you don’t possess. When you claim that we need to ban “gas-assisted, receiver firearms” you’re trying to make a semi-automatic weapon sound like a machine gun for a reason.          It’s not always the mechanics, either. When Joe Scarborough misrepresents the Heller decision, he’s preying on policy ignorance that has little to do with gun culture. When Steve Schmidt goes on television and passionately tells an audience that it’s more difficult to buy cough medicine than an “AK-47 – or 50 of them,” he’s either lying or he has absolutely no grasp of how gun policy works. Either way, he shouldn’t be talking to grownups about firearms.          All these people use a moralistic fallacy, which is often predicated on the ignorance Weinstein rationalizes. Not that it stops him from embracing the appeal to authority he condemns elsewhere.          For example, Weinstein takes Fox News personality Tomi Lahren to task for failing to mention that “the family” of Eugene Stoner, the AR-15’s designer and champion, claimed in 2016 that the inventor would be “horrified and sickened to see his military rifle pattern become so common in civilian households and school shootings.” You’ll notice the conflation. Of course Stoner would be horrified that his gun was used in school shootings. But Weinstein fails to note that there’s no evidence anywhere on the record that Stoner was “horrified and sickened” by the notion of civilians owning his gun. Since he was selling proto AR-15s to civilians a decade before his military model was adopted by the United States, we have no reason to believe he would be.          Perhaps that kind of discussion spurns conversation in favor of condescension. But at least it’s a debate that revolves around the veracity of facts. Which is a lot more I can say for the rest of the “gunsplaining” grievance.  \n",
       "42  “None of the major shootings that have occurred in this country over the last few months or years that have outraged us, would gun laws have prevented them.”          A colleague pointed out this statement by Marco Rubio as a possible fact check, suggesting that it was almost certainly incorrect. It posed an interesting challenge, given the reams of data to examine.          The Fact Checker obviously takes no position on proposed gun-control laws. But given the attention of recent mass public shootings, is Rubio correct that none of the major shootings in recent years would have been prevented by new gun laws?          Rubio was not specific in his time frame — and a spokesman declined to elaborate — but for the purposes of this fact check we will go back as far as the Newtown shooting in 2012, which touched off the current gun debate.          First of all, we should note that there is an unbridgeable gap in opinion about efficacy of various gun proposals, particularly regarding assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.          “The common thread that binds most mass shootings is semiautomatic firearms with the ability to accept a high-capacity detachable ammunition magazine,” said Avery Palmer, communications director at the Violence Policy Center, which supports restrictions on guns. “These can range from assault rifles, pistols, and shotguns, to compact, high-capacity pistols marketed for concealed carry. Today’s gun industry has embraced increased lethality as its marketing lodestar, and one key element in reducing the occurrence and severity of mass shootings lies in ratcheting down the firepower in civilian hands.”          By contrast, gun-rights supporters argue that bans on certain weapons and large-capacity magazines would accomplish little. There are already more than 5 million AR-type rifles in circulation in the United States, ownership of which would have been grandfathered under proposed bans.          A previous nationwide assault-weapons ban, which lasted 10 years and lapsed in 2004, was easily circumvented by gun manufacturers, in part because of various loopholes. The evidence is mixed on how effective that ban was, with both sides often cherry-picking from the most comprehensive report on that law, written in 2004 by Christopher Koper of George Mason University. “The ban did not appear to affect gun crime during the time it was in effect, but some evidence suggests it may have modestly reduced gunshot victimizations had it remained in place for a longer period,” Koper wrote in 2013.          John R. Lott Jr., at the pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center, notes that such bans would target .223-caliber weapons but would not affect more powerful semiautomatic rifles using .30-06 caliber, which are used for hunting deer. (This video demonstrates the difference.)          Meanwhile, an experienced shooter, as shown in this video, can change a magazine in just two to four seconds. That calls into question whether such a ban would significantly reduce the death toll.          A new study by Gary Kleck of Florida State University studied news accounts of 23 shootings between 1994 and 2013 in which more than six people were killed or wounded and large-capacity magazines were used. In only one case was a shooter stopped as he tried to reload. In all of these 23 incidents, the shooter possessed either multiple guns or multiple magazines, indicating that a determined shooter would not have been deterred by smaller magazines.          Now let’s look at the facts behind Rubio’s statement. Is there evidence that gun law proposals would have prevented the recent high-profile mass shootings?          We developed the following list of 12 mass shootings since 2012 catalogued in the Mother Jones database of U.S. mass shootings, with details obtained from various news and official reports. We will look at whether proposals might have made a difference in how the guns were obtained, or whether existing laws worked as intended.          Dec. 2, 2015: Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., using a Smith & Wesson M&P AR-15 type rifle, a DPMS Panther Arms AR-15 type rifle, a Smith & Wesson semiautomatic pistol and a Llama semiautomatic pistol. The guns were purchased legally and the rifles were purchased legally by a former neighbor. (The transfer of the rifles to the suspects may have violated California and federal laws.) Four high-capacity magazines were found, perhaps holding as many as 30 rounds.          Oct. 1, 2015: Christopher Harper-Mercer killed nine people at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. He owned 14 firearms and conducted the attack with six of them, including a Glock pistol, a Smith & Wesson pistol, a Taurus pistol and a Del-Ton AR-15 rifle. All were purchased legally.          July 16, 2015: Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez killed five people and wounded two at the Navy Operational Support Center and Marine Corps Reserve Center in Chattanooga, Tenn. He used an AK-47-style rifle and 9mm handgun, and a shotgun was in his car. He had multiple 30-round magazines, news reports said. Officials said the gun was obtained legally; other weapons were obtained through Armslist.com, an online forum through which individuals can buy and sell firearms through private transactions.          June 17, 2015: Dylann Roof killed nine people with a .45-caliber Glock pistol that held 13 rounds at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C. Roof legally purchased his gun from a store, but the FBI said he should have failed the background check because he had been charged with possessing Suboxone without a prescription. However, because of clerical mistakes, the FBI said the examiner did not get hold of the report before the three-day waiting period ended, and so the store went through with the purchase.          Oct. 24, 2014: Jaylen Ray Fryberg, a teenager, killed four students with a high-capacity Beretta pistol at the Marysville-Pilchuck High School cafeteria in Marysville, Wash. The pistol belonged to his father, who was the subject of a permanent protection order. That should have prevented the purchase of the gun, but the order had not been entered in the system and so his father passed the background check. The father was later found guilty of knowingly purchasing six firearms he could not legally possess.          Feb. 20, 2014: Cherie Lash Rhoades killed four people and wounded two at the Cedarville Rancheria Tribal Office and Community Center in Alturas, Calif. She used a 9mm semiautomatic handgun and stabbed a person with a butcher knife when a second gun apparently jammed. It isn’t clear how the gun was obtained; her trial has not taken place. (Note: Rhoades killed her brother, niece, nephew and another tribal member, so some might say this is a family dispute, not a mass public shooting.)          Sept. 16, 2013: Aaron Alexis, who had been treated for mental health issues but never committed, killed 12 people with a Remington shotgun at the Washington Navy Yard. He had tried to buy a handgun at a Virginia store but changed his mind after he was told it would have to be delivered to his home state through another federally licensed dealer. But he was able to purchase a shotgun. He passed state and federal background checks; he had been arrested three times but not convicted.          July 26, 2013: Pedro Vargas set fire to his apartment in Hialeah, Fla., and killed six people with a Glock 17 9mm semiautomatic handgun. Vargas bought his handgun legally and had a concealed weapons permit. (Note: Most of the deaths took place in an apartment complex, not a public space, so some say this should not be considered a public shooting.)          June 7, 2013: John Zawahri killed five people in Santa Monica, Calif., using a .223 semiautomatic rifle, similar in type to an AR-15. He also had multiple 30-round magazines — which are illegal in California — and during the rampage had dropped a bag which contained additional loaded magazines, a handgun and the upper receiver for a semiautomatic rifle. He also appeared to have made some weapons that are illegal. Investigators later found a 2011 letter from the Department of Justice informing Zawahri that he was not eligible to purchase a firearm.          April 21, 2013: Dennis Clark III shot and killed his girlfriend in their apartment in Federal Way, Wash., and then killed three other people using a .40-caliber Taurus semiautomatic pistol and a pistol-grip Mossberg 500 pump shotgun with a four-round saddle. The weapons were obtained legally, and he had a concealed pistol license.          March 13, 2013: Kurt Myers killed four people and wounded two with a shotgun in neighboring towns in Herkimer County, N.Y. The shotgun apparently was obtained legally.          Dec. 14, 2012: Adam Lanza killed his mother in their home with a Savage Mark II .22-caliber rifle and then killed 26 people, mostly children, with a Bushmaster XM-15 rifle (with a 30-round magazine) at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. His weapons, which also included handguns and a 12-gauge semiautomatic shotgun, were found in Lanza’s car outside the school and had been legally obtained by his mother, a gun enthusiast. Lanza, in effect, stole his mother’s firearms.          This is certainly a depressing chronicle of death and tragedy. But Rubio’s statement stands up to scrutiny — at least for the recent past, as he framed it. Notably, three of the mass shootings took place in California, which already has strong gun laws including a ban on certain weapons and high-capacity magazines.          Gun-control advocates often point to the experience in other countries that have enacted gun laws that heavily restrict gun ownership; as we have shown, quantitative measures of cross-comparative crime statistics, especially where the crime is not consistently defined (i.e., “mass shooting”), usually end up being apples-to-oranges comparisons. It is possible that some gun-control proposals, such as a ban on large-capacity magazines, would reduce the number of dead in a future shooting, though the evidence for that is heavily disputed. But Rubio was speaking in the past, about specific incidents. He earns a rare Geppetto Checkmark.

                                                                          WASHINGTON — Sen. Chris Murphy attempted to pass a gun control package Thursday morning, watched it get blocked by Republicans, and then gave a speech about the need to do something about the regular mass shootings in America. He didn’t know until he walked out that another mass shooting had just happened, this time at a high school in California.          “I found out as soon as I walked off the floor,” Murphy told medianame News.          Two students were killed and several others were injured when a 16-year-old went on a shooting spree at a school in Santa Clarita on Thursday morning.          Murphy had asked for the Senate to unanimously agree to pass universal background checks for firearms, as he’s done repeatedly for months. “The American public are not going to accept silence from the body week after week, month after month in the face of this epidemic carnage that is happening in this country,” he said.          But even after news of the shooting spread through the Senate — Sen. Richard Blumenthal found out via a note from a staffer while he was giving a speech about gun violence — Murphy said he doesn’t believe it will change anything.          “I wish this weren’t the case, but Republicans’ interest in working on guns is driven by casualties of 15 or more. It’s so awful that it works like this,” he said. “I don’t doubt that we’ll be back in a conversation about background checks, but it probably won’t happen until there’s another epic-scale shooting.”          Some Republicans have long opposed the bill, arguing that universal background checks violate Second Amendment rights. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, the Republican who objected to Murphy trying to get a vote on the bill Thursday morning, argued that the legislation “should not be fast-tracked by the Senate.”          “Many questions about this legislation need to be answered before it’s forced upon law-abiding gun owners,\" Hyde-Smith said.          In September, House Democrats advanced three additional gun bills following mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, which left a total of 31 people dead. There was also momentum toward a bipartisan gun control package negotiated with the White House.          But Murphy said he hadn’t heard from the Trump administration about background checks since September.          Lindsey Graham, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said there is bipartisan support for one part of a gun control package — a grant program that encourages states to set up “red flag” programs that allow law enforcement officers to preemptively seize a person’s firearms if they are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. But he said progress on background checks has stalled, and blamed, in part, the House impeachment inquiry.          “Impeachment has sucked all the oxygen out. But I hope we will revisit. I really do. I am ready to do something yesterday,” said Graham.          The House passed universal background checks in late February. The bill received bipartisan support with eight Republicans crossing the aisle to vote for the legislation. Since then, universal background checks have remained stalled in the Republican-led Senate at the behest of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.          Attorney General Bill Barr blamed the House impeachment hearings for derailing the progress on gun control during an event in Tennessee on Wednesday. But Murphy refuted those claims Thursday morning.          “That’s not true,” Murphy said, addressing Barr’s comments on the Senate floor. “The impeachment proceedings right now are in the House of Representatives; the discussion on the future of the background checks bill was in the Senate.”  \n",

implemented after the Christchurch massacre in March.          Despite a penalty of up to five years in prison, up to two-thirds of firearms banned by the legislation were not turned in before the Friday deadline by New Zealand gun owners, the Washington Post reported.          While 47,000 semi-automatic rifles have been collected, according to police statistics, a government commissioned study determined that the small nation likely contains between 56,000 and 170,000 now banned weapons, according to 1 News.          New Zealand’s largest gun rights advocacy group, the Licensed Firearms Owners Council, remarked that the buyback program has been an “unmitigated failure.”          Police Minister Stuart Nash blamed the government’s inability to enforce its buyback scheme on a lack of gun registration. “The problem is we just don’t know exactly how many guns are out in the community, this is why we need a register, to enable Police to better track firearms,” he said, according to 1 News.          On March 15, 2019, a right-wing extremist opened fire on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand during Friday prayer, killing 51 worshipers and injuring 49 others. As a result of this terrorist attack, New Zealand’s parliament quickly passed legislation to ban all weapons similar to the ones used by the shooter.          When it was first proposed, New Zealand’s plan to confiscate military-style weapons was praised by members of the American left. Several Democratic presidential candidates, most notably New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, have been vocal with their support for similar programs.

I can’t imagine American gun owners going along with this [buybacks], even to the modest level of compliance that New Zealand seems to have gotten,” Eugene Volokh, a legal scholar from the University of California, told the Post.          The Post also noted how the vast majority of New Zealanders support more gun control, and that the country lacks constitutional protections for the right to bear arms — unlike the U.S.  \n",

                                                                                                               HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - When Pennsylvania lawmakers were rushing to wrap up the session’s business in June, aides to state Attorney General Josh Shapiro came to them with a request: expand the office’s authority to pursue gun-trafficking crimes across the state.          The idea was to insert the measure into a fast-tracked bill dealing with drug crimes. But the request - to give the office statewide jurisdiction to prosecute illegal gun possession, sales and transfers - got put aside for the summer amid objections, apparently revolving around law-enforcement turf and gun politics.          “It didn’t take long to become apparent that the statewide jurisdictional change was going to cause far too many problems with legislation that had to get done,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rob Kauffman, who was in charge of shepherding the bill.          Calls to respond to gun violence in Pennsylvania have only grown since then, coming to a head in mid-August when a man with a long criminal record - which barred him from legally possessing firearms - allegedly shot and wounded six Philadelphia police officers during a standoff.          Still, it’s unclear whether the provision has any chance of becoming law in the Republican-controlled Legislature after lawmakers return to session in September.          Under current law, the attorney general’s office cannot prosecute gun-trafficking cases without a referral from a district attorney.          Shapiro’s aides point to the success of a joint gun-violence task force that, since 2006, has stationed state gun-trafficking agents in Philadelphia and personnel in the Philadelphia district attorney’s office to prosecute those cases.          The attorney general’s office could use the authority to offer similar help to police departments and district attorneys in other counties, Shapiro’s aides said, and track gun-trafficking pipelines across the state.          It’s not necessarily novel: The attorney general’s office already has legal authority to prosecute various crimes without a district attorney’s referral, including human trafficking and narcotics.          After receiving the request, House Judiciary Committee staff checked with a short list of law enforcement organizations and gun-rights groups to see if they would support the idea, said Kauffman, R-Franklin.          Not all of them did.          Kauffman would not say exactly who objected to it, or describe specific objections, although he acknowledged discomfort from gun-rights proponents.          “I would say that generally our second amendment advocates do have concern with folks they perceive as anti-gun proposing or attempting to infringe on their rights through additional laws,” Kauffman said.          Shapiro, a Democrat who is widely viewed as a future candidate for governor, backs various bills that gun-rights groups have tended to oppose, such as an expansion of background checks to private sales of shotguns, sporting rifles and semi-automatic rifles.          Rep. Jared Solomon, D-Philadelphia, a lead supporter of expanding the attorney general’s authority to enforce gun-trafficking laws, said Judiciary Committee staff told him that the NRA opposed the provision.          “The NRA will tell you they want to enforce the laws on the books, so what did we do? We give them a vehicle to do just that, which is to enforce the laws on the books, which is to provide more resources to that end. And they said, ‘No,’” said Solomon.          An NRA spokeswoman countered that the organization took no position on the bill, and said it routinely calls for the enforcement of existing gun laws.          “Criminals should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and we take no position on who should do the prosecuting,” NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter said in a statement.          Kim Stolfer, chairman of the Pennsylvania-based gun-rights group, Firearms Owners Against Crime, said he told Judiciary Committee staff that he had no problem with the idea.          “If you commit a crime with a firearm, you should pay a price and we’re not doing that,” Stolfer said.          The state Fraternal Order of Police lodge and the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association said they had not been asked for an official position.          But the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association, which represents 66 of the state’s 67 county prosecutors, had objections. Its director of legislation and policy, Greg Rowe, said the association would support the measure only with certain parameters: giving a district attorney the “right of first refusal” to prosecute the case or linking the jurisdiction to a joint task force.          Rowe said he didn’t hear back from the committee after he pitched the counterproposal.          Shapiro’s aides, meanwhile, said they had had conflicting reports about who objected.          “We heard first that, ‘Yep, we’re in good shape, everyone’s good with this,’” said David Wade, Shapiro’s chief of staff. “And then we heard, ‘Change in plans, this isn’t going.’”  "

       "      <td>A Virginia sheriff told Fox News host Tucker Carlson that he and his staff are “ready to protect” his county’s citizens from their Second Amendment rights being “infringed upon.”          Sheriff Chad Cubbage appeared on Monday night’s edition of “Tucker Carlson Tonight” to discuss strong local reactions against the proposal of several restrictive gun control bills in the wake of Democrats winning control of both state houses.          “We are hopeful that our legislators are listening,” Cubbage said in response to Carlson’s question about what he ultimately planned to do if the laws are passed. “We are having town hall meetings here throughout the Shenandoah Valley and we are having thousands of people show up to these town hall meetings to voice their concerns. We just really hope that they are listening in Richmond and our legislators will not go through with these bills.”          The Page County sheriff told Tucker that so-called “assault weapons” aren’t a problem in his county, adding that the proposed “unconstitutional” bills would inhibit such practices as even a parent “taking their child out to hunt at an early age.” (RELATED: Virginia Sheriff Promises To Deputize Thousands If Red Flag Laws Are Passed)          The Fox News host brought up Virginia Governor Ralph Northam’s veiled threat to bring in the national guard to enforce state gun laws. To which Cubbage replied:          Like I said, I am hoping that they are listening in Richmond. My staff and I stand ready to protect the citizens of Page County from their rights being infringed upon. It is not law enforcement’s place to infringe upon the rights of law-abiding citizens. It is our obligation to protect them from those types of things being done. And I am thankful that we have a president that supports the Second Amendment and that believes in the Constitution.          “I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone say as you do so clearly, law enforcement exists to protect our rights, which is a wonderful thing to hear,” Carlson replied.          Meanwhile, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring declared Friday that the Second Amendment sanctuary city decrees passed by the majority of counties in the state have “no force of law.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Emblematic of the shift was the victory of Shelly Simonds: In 2017, she lost a Virginia Beach seat in the House of Delegates when the winner of a tie was drawn from a bowl; in 2019, she won with 58 percent and virtually the same number of votes, while the incumbent who defeated her two years ago received 3,500 fewer votes.          Democrats have a very different party from the one that last controlled both the legislature and governor’s office, before 1993. The old coalition of small farmers, black residents and city dwellers is gone. Instead the Democrats are educated, racially and ethnically diverse and dominated by women. They want gun control and better transit, health care and schools — and passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.          Republicans, by contrast, have a shrinking base. Their margins in the suburbs have vanished. Their voters are whiter, less educated and rural. They have stuck to the same issues — anti-tax, antiabortion, pro-gun — that are untenable for a majority party in a state that has embraced the Capital Beltway’s high-tech, value-added economy.          Just ask Danica Roem. In 2017, she proudly acknowledged that she was trans and beat Bob Marshall and his homophobic campaign by running on better roads for fast-growing Prince William County. Roem cruised to reelection.          But the emotional backdrop of the last two years in the seat of the Confederacy is statues. In August 2017, white supremacists converged on Charlottesville to defend the display of a 1924 statue of Robert E. Lee on horseback. Trump defended the protesters — producing the low point of his popularity. Four months later, the state House’s GOP bottled up bills that would have allowed localities to remove statues. It blocked Arlington from renaming Jefferson Davis Highway (Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring’s advisory opinion last spring circumvented the General Assembly).          Republicans in their 2018 Virginia Senate primary voted for a candidate who linked defenses of Trump and the statues as key planks in his unsuccessful campaign, continuing a string of statewide GOP losses dating to 2009. And in January, Senate Republicans still stopped to honor Lee — leading Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax to sit down.          Conventional wisdom is that Virginia’s Democrats go to sleep in the third year after a presidential election, when all 40 Senate seats are at the top of the ballot. But the new party ranks are the “pussy hats” of Jan. 21, 2017, who didn’t go home after the largest protest in Washington in memory. They organized, ran for office, knocked on doors, posted signs, wrote checks. They held meetings, publicized issues, built networks of committed volunteers who turned from electioneering to lobbying the legislature back to electioneering. In January, they’ll go back to Richmond to ensure that their issues are addressed. And after that, they’ll work for Trump’s defeat.          In the process, the Indivisibles and We of Action and Network NOVA and Moms Demand Action and scores of other spontaneously formed and rigorously maintained grass-roots groups have accelerated the death of the Confederacy in the same State House that governed the Lost Cause. The outgoing GOP legislature was the remaining bulwark defending its symbols, like the statues of Davis and Lee on Richmond’s Monument Avenue.          Expect that one of the first bills that Gov. Ralph Northam (himself the subject of a “blackface” scandal 10 months ago) will sign next winter will authorize localities to remove those statues. That page of our history is about to turn.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Virginia Beach City Council voted Monday to add the city to a growing list of nearly 100 cities and counties that have joined the \"Second Amendment sanctuary\" movement in the commonwealth of Virginia, but some critics are decrying the trend as lawless. The city council resolution declared a \"continued commitment to support all provisions of the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia, including the right of the people to keep and bear arms.\" Measures passed in other cities and counties differ, but all share a common purpose: opposition to anticipated new gun control laws coming out of the now Democratically controlled state government in Richmond. \"People -- in rural counties especially -- they get a little upset when all of a sudden something that they could do one day ... then the next day it's illegal, that kind of strikes a chord,\" said Shenandoah County Sheriff and Virginia Sheriffs Association president Tim Carter on medianame Nation's \"Deep Dive\" on Tuesday. \"Is the United States Constitution not the law? Isn't that the supreme law of the land?\" he continued, arguing that proposed legislation in Richmond may infringe of his constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms. \"The Constitution -- we all have a duty to uphold it,\" said criminal defense attorney and civil rights attorney Ken Belkin. \"I'm sure the sheriff swore an oath to it. I know I swore an oath to it. But the reality is there was an election. Elections have consequences. And unfortunately, with all due respect to the sheriff, he doesn't get to decide. ... He doesn't get to decide which laws he enforces.\" \"I think the proper thing to do would be for any gun-owning Virginian that's going to be affected by this law,\" Belkin continued. \"that would have standing to challenge this law, to bring it into court, challenge the law, and maybe ask for an injunction on the law taking effect.\" A recent opinion piece in the Washington Post called the called referred to the \"Second Amendment sanctuary\" movement as \"ugly\" and \"disturbing.\" Seth Lipsky, founding editor of The New York Sun, argued that is, in fact, the opposite. \"I would start with just how basic and important the Second Amendment right is,\" said Lipsky. \"This is a really basic right and predates the Constitution.\" \"I think it's very significant that Sheriff Carter and every other sheriff in the United States must -- must it's required by our Constitution -- swear to support the Constitution,\" he continued. \"So if a sheriff is confronted with a law that he thinks is conflicting with the constitution he's sworn to support\" they must be taken seriously          Lipsky concluded by saying that that U.S. Supreme Court must do more to settle disputes over the Second Amendment, because the debate is coming to a head in Virginia and around the country. \"What the sheriffs are doing in Virginia -- they're not alone,\" said Lipsky. \"There are others in the state of Washington -- some of these western states. This has been a movement already. ... This is a serious question. And the Supreme Court has moved by inches or microns, and it's really shocking.\" To watch all of \"Deep Dive\" go to medianame Nation and sign up today.

       "      <td>Gun control is just the start.          Now that the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates are controlled by Democrats for the first time in a generation, the legislature has the votes to move the state to the left, and gun control is at the top of their agenda. One bill mandates background checks for private sales of firearms, another prohibits the purchase of more than one handgun per month, and a third allows municipalities to ban firearms from public spaces and events. On Tuesday, a day after a large, peaceful crowd gathered outside the capitol building in Richmond, Va. to protest the bills, the state Senate took up “red-flag” legislation that would allow any attorney or law-enforcement official to apply for an emergency judicial order to “prohibit a person who poses a substantial risk of injury to himself or others from purchasing, possessing, or transporting a firearm.”          Gun control, though, is only part of the Democratic legislature’s agenda.          To pull the state’s economic policy to the left, Virginia Democrats have proposed measures to weaken the state’s right-to-work law, curb greenhouse-gas emissions, and raise the minimum wage.          To do the same for its social policy, they’ve introduced a bill that would repeal conscience protections for Catholic and other religious adoption agencies, effectively shutting those agencies down, and a bill that would require all public elementary and secondary schools to allow students who identify as transgender to participate on the sports teams and use the locker-rooms and showers of their preference.          On abortion, one bill would remove parental–consent requirements, 24-hour waiting periods, and ultrasound requirements. Another bill would declare that a “pregnant person has a fundamental right to choose to carry a pregnancy to term, give birth to a child, or terminate a pregnancy.” Yet another proposes a constitutional amendment enshrining a right to abortion: “an individual’s right to personal reproductive autonomy is central to the enjoyment of life and liberty and shall not be denied or infringed upon unless justified by a compelling interest of the Commonwealth and achieved by the least restrictive means.” When the budget comes up for debate, Democrats will have the opportunity to provide taxpayer funding of elective abortions.          Opponents of the flurry of bills essentially have only two things to give them hope. The first is Virginia’s short legislative period: The Virginia constitution gives the General Assembly only 60 days (including weekends) to hold its legislative session in even-numbered years, and only 30 days in odd-numbered years. Virginia Democrats have already chewed up about a quarter of the current 60-day session with their gun-control bills and the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. Each house of the Virginia legislature has only three more weeks until the February 11 deadline to act on its own legislation. The clock is ticking.          The other potential break on the legislature’s progressive ambitions is the reluctance of Senate Democrats, who only control the upper chamber 21–19, to push the envelope too far. Senate Democratic fears of a backlash among voters outside of Northern Virginia could be detected last week when Virginia’s Senate Judiciary Committee killed an assault-weapons ban. But Virginia Republicans caution that a slightly watered-down version of the ban is still very much alive in the House of Delegates and might be able to win passage in the Senate. Three weeks isn’t much time for Democrats to pass their wish list of left-wing bills, but it could certainly be enough time. Conservatives must hope that the potential long-term political consequences deter them from doing so.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In Virginia, Terry McAuliffe Breaks the Constitution to Plump the Democratic Vote</td>\n",
       "      <td>In what is likely an unconstitutional state action seemingly calculated to ensure that the purple state of Virginia goes blue in the November election, Governor Terry McAuliffe (D.) signed an order on Friday restoring the voting rights of 206,000 ex-felons in Virginia, including those convicted of murder, armed robbery, rape, sexual assault, and other violent crimes. The order also restores their right to sit on a jury, become a notary, and even serve in elected office.          McAuliffe believes that ex-felons can be trusted to make decisions in the ballot booth and the jury box but apparently not to own a gun. He draws the line at restoring their Second Amendment rights; that would be a bridge too far. His order specifically does not restore their “right to ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.” And while his order requires that felons complete probation and parole before enjoying restoration of their rights, it applies regardless of whether they have paid any court fines or restitution to victims.          What McAuliffe entirely dismisses is the principle that if you won’t follow the law yourself, you can’t demand a role in making the law for everyone else, which is what you do when you vote. Restoring a felon’s right to vote should be done not automatically, as soon as he has completed his sentence, but carefully, on a case-by-case basis, after he has shown that he has really turned over a new leaf. The unfortunate truth is that many people who walk out of prison will be walking back in; recidivism rates are high. We have both testified before Congress and written about this problem. Governor McAuliffe may be happy as long as the ex-felons who can now vote just don’t walk back into prison before November.          Having a waiting period, examining each ex-felon’s application for restoration of rights carefully and individually, and differentiating between violent and nonviolent crimes is exactly the system that Virginia had — at least until Friday’s order. In a three-page summary released by the governor’s office, McAuliffe asserts that any claim that he doesn’t have the authority to grant a blanket restoration of rights is “far-outside the weight of constitutional authority across the nation and would read into the text of the Virginia Constitution words that simply are not there.” This is just legal gibberish — the weight of constitutional authority “across the nation” has no bearing on interpreting the Virginia constitution. McAuliffe is reading into that constitution authority he does not have.          That isn’t just our opinion; it is the opinion of prior governors and attorneys general of both political parties. For example, on January 15, 2010, Mark Rubin, the counselor for former Virginia governor Tim Kaine (D., now a U.S. senator), sent a letter on the governor’s behalf to the ACLU, saying that Kaine did not have the executive power “to grant a blanket restoration of voting rights,” which the ACLU had requested. Kaine supported restoration of voting rights but refused to act because his counsel’s view was that the “better argument” was that the powers in the Virginia constitutional provision on clemency (Article 5, Section 12) “are meant to apply in particular cases to named individuals.” In fact, “a blanket order restoring the voting rights of everyone would be a rewrite of the law. . . . The notion that the Constitution of the Commonwealth could be rewritten via executive order is troubling.”          Similarly, then–attorney general Ken Cuccinelli (R.) appointed the Rights Restoration Advisory Committee to examine this issue. The committee included not only several Commonwealth Attorneys (i.e., the district attorneys of Virginia counties) and a professor from George Mason University but also Ashley Taylor Jr., a former commissioner on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and Paul Goldman, the former senior adviser to Doug Wilder (D.), the first African-American governor of Virginia.          On May 10, 2013, the committee issued a report concluding that the governor does not have constitutional authority to “institute by executive order” a complete “restoration of rights for all convicted felons in the Commonwealth of Virginia.” Why? Because his clemency power in Article 5 must be harmonized with Article 2, Section 1, which provides that “no person who has been convicted of a felony shall be qualified to vote unless his civil rights have been restored.” If, instead of acting individually to consider each “person” and “his civil rights,” the governor issues a blanket restoration, such “altering [of] the public policy of the Commonwealth as regards the disenfranchisement of persons convicted of felonies clearly would be a legislative act, not an administrative act.” It would be “difficult” for a court to “sustain a Governor’s exercise of [his] clemency power in so sweeping a manner that the Constitution’s general policy of disenfranchisement of felons is voided.”          Yet that is exactly what McAuliffe attempts to do through his executive order, in a violation of the separation of powers. He is acting like a superlegislator in voiding the policy that has existed in Virginia “in one form or another since the [Virginia] Constitution of 1830,” according to the Cuccinelli’s report. (The New York Times incorrectly reported that the policy dated only to the Civil War; the Richmond Times-Dispatch, to the state’s 1902 constitution. Conversely, the current constitution was actually written in 1971, and no evidence has been cited that there was any discriminatory intent in it.)          As was completely predictable, McAuliffe played the race card on Friday, saying he was rectifying Virginia’s “long and sad history” of suppressing African-American voting power. This is a bogus and demagogic claim about a policy that applies equally to all felons regardless of race and that was established when black Virginians couldn’t even vote. Similar false claims about the history and origin of felon disenfranchisement have been made in numerous discrimination lawsuits that have been filed under the Voting Rights Act but have been uniformly unsuccessful.          Supreme Court precedent is that such a provision can be overturned as unconstitutional if it was adopted or applied with a racially discriminatory intent. If evidence existed that the Virginia law was racially discriminatory in its origins or application, many well-funded civil-rights advocacy organizations, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, would be eager to challenge it. The lack of successful challenges in Virginia indicates that such evidence does not exist. As always, liberals want to equate disparate impact with racial discrimination, and it just ain’t so.          It is estimated that McAuliffe’s action will add 3.8 percent to the 5.4 million registered voters in Virginia. That may not seem like a lot, but McAuliffe knows very well that Virginia today is a swing state with recent statewide elections that have been decided by a very small margin. In 2013, the current attorney general, Mark Herring (D.), won his race by only 907 votes. Former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell (R.) won his prior post as attorney general by only 360 votes in 2005. Even the Washington Post, which applauded McAuliffe’s action, acknowledged there is “no doubt” about the “political dimension” in this move by “a Democrat and longtime friend and fundraiser for Bill and Hillary Clinton” — namely, that it “grant[s] Democrats a crucial edge in a swing state ahead of November’s presidential election.”          McAuliffe is continuing a pattern. Last year he vetoed a bill that would have helped clean up voter-registration lists. The bill required county court clerks to send to local election officials information about individuals who were excused from jury duty because they were not U.S. citizens or were no longer residents of Virginia. McAuliffe seems intent on making sure that ineligible and illegal voters can continue to vote.          He is following the example set by President Obama: If you don’t like a law or a constitutional limit on your authority, just ignore it. Rewrite, change, or bend it. The New York Times inadvertently gave the game away when it said that McAuliffe’s “action effectively overturns a Civil War–era provision in the state’s Constitution.”          McAuliffe’s willingness to do anything (and to say anything) to achieve partisan political goals shows a complete contempt for the rule of law and for the constitutional republic that is the United States. What a sad day for the great state that was the home of Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, James Madison, George Mason, and the father of our country, George Washington.

and his staff are “ready to protect” his county’s citizens from their Second Amendment rights being “infringed upon.”          Sheriff Chad Cubbage appeared on Monday night’s edition of “Tucker Carlson Tonight” to discuss strong local reactions against the proposal of several restrictive gun control bills in the wake of Democrats winning control of both state houses.          “We are hopeful that our legislators are listening,” Cubbage said in response to Carlson’s question about what he ultimately planned to do if the laws are passed. “We are having town hall meetings here throughout the Shenandoah Valley and we are having thousands of people show up to these town hall meetings to voice their concerns. We just really hope that they are listening in Richmond and our legislators will not go through with these bills.”          The Page County sheriff told Tucker that so-called “assault weapons” aren’t a problem in his county, adding that the proposed “unconstitutional” bills would inhibit such practices as even a parent “taking their child out to hunt at an early age.” (RELATED: Virginia Sheriff Promises To Deputize Thousands If Red Flag Laws Are Passed)          The Fox News host brought up Virginia Governor Ralph Northam’s veiled threat to bring in the national guard to enforce state gun laws. To which Cubbage replied:          Like I said, I am hoping that they are listening in Richmond. My staff and I stand ready to protect the citizens of Page County from their rights being infringed upon. It is not law enforcement’s place to infringe upon the rights of law-abiding citizens. It is our obligation to protect them from those types of things being done. And I am thankful that we have a president that supports the Second Amendment and that believes in the Constitution.          “I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone say as you do so clearly, law enforcement exists to protect our rights, which is a wonderful thing to hear,” Carlson replied.          Meanwhile, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring declared Friday that the Second Amendment sanctuary city decrees passed by the majority of counties in the state have “no force of law.”\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Emblematic of the shift was the victory of Shelly Simonds: In 2017, she lost a Virginia Beach seat in the House of Delegates when the winner of a tie was drawn from a bowl; in 2019, she won with 58 percent and virtually the same number of votes, while the incumbent who defeated her two years ago received 3,500 fewer votes.          Democrats have a very different party from the one that last controlled both the legislature and governor’s office, before 1993. The old coalition of small farmers, black residents and city dwellers is gone. Instead the Democrats are educated, racially and ethnically diverse and dominated by women. They want gun control and better transit, health care and schools — and passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.          Republicans, by contrast, have a shrinking base. Their margins in the suburbs have vanished. Their voters are whiter, less educated and rural. They have stuck to the same issues — anti-tax, antiabortion, pro-gun — that are untenable for a majority party in a state that has embraced the Capital Beltway’s high-tech, value-added economy.          Just ask Danica Roem. In 2017, she proudly acknowledged that she was trans and beat Bob Marshall and his homophobic campaign by running on better roads for fast-growing Prince William County. Roem cruised to reelection.          But the emotional backdrop of the last two years in the seat of the Confederacy is statues. In August 2017, white supremacists converged on Charlottesville to defend the display of a 1924 statue of Robert E. Lee on horseback. Trump defended the protesters — producing the low point of his popularity. Four months later, the state House’s GOP bottled up bills that would have allowed localities to remove statues. It blocked Arlington from renaming Jefferson Davis Highway (Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring’s advisory opinion last spring circumvented the General Assembly).          Republicans in their 2018 Virginia Senate primary voted for a candidate who linked defenses of Trump and the statues as key planks in his unsuccessful campaign, continuing a string of statewide GOP losses dating to 2009. And in January, Senate Republicans still stopped to honor Lee — leading Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax to sit down.          Conventional wisdom is that Virginia’s Democrats go to sleep in the third year after a presidential election, when all 40 Senate seats are at the top of the ballot. But the new party ranks are the “pussy hats” of Jan. 21, 2017, who didn’t go home after the largest protest in Washington in memory. They organized, ran for office, knocked on doors, posted signs, wrote checks. They held meetings, publicized issues, built networks of committed volunteers who turned from electioneering to lobbying the legislature back to electioneering. In January, they’ll go back to Richmond to ensure that their issues are addressed. And after that, they’ll work for Trump’s defeat.          In the process, the Indivisibles and We of Action and Network NOVA and Moms Demand Action and scores of other spontaneously formed and rigorously maintained grass-roots groups have accelerated the death of the Confederacy in the same State House that governed the Lost Cause. The outgoing GOP legislature was the remaining bulwark defending its symbols, like the statues of Davis and Lee on Richmond’s Monument Avenue.          Expect that one of the first bills that Gov. Ralph Northam (himself the subject of a “blackface” scandal 10 months ago) will sign next winter will authorize localities to remove those statues. That page of our history is about to turn.\n",

The Virginia Beach City Council voted Monday to add the city to a growing list of nearly 100 cities and counties that have joined the \"Second Amendment sanctuary\" movement in the commonwealth of Virginia, but some critics are decrying the trend as lawless. The city council resolution declared a \"continued commitment to support all provisions of the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia, including the right of the people to keep and bear arms.\" Measures passed in other cities and counties differ, but all share a common purpose: opposition to anticipated new gun control laws coming out of the now Democratically controlled state government in Richmond. \"People -- in rural counties especially -- they get a little upset when all of a sudden something that they could do one day ... then the next day it's illegal, that kind of strikes a chord,\" said Shenandoah County Sheriff and Virginia Sheriffs Association president Tim Carter on medianame Nation's \"Deep Dive\" on Tuesday. \"Is the United States Constitution not the law? Isn't that the supreme law of the land?\" he continued, arguing that proposed legislation in Richmond may infringe of his constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms. \"The Constitution -- we all have a duty to uphold it,\" said criminal defense attorney and civil rights attorney Ken Belkin. \"I'm sure the sheriff swore an oath to it. I know I swore an oath to it. But the reality is there was an election. Elections have consequences. And unfortunately, with all due respect to the sheriff, he doesn't get to decide. ... He doesn't get to decide which laws he enforces.\" \"I think the proper thing to do would be for any gun-owning Virginian that's going to be affected by this law,\" Belkin continued. \"that would have standing to challenge this law, to bring it into court, challenge the law, and maybe ask for an injunction on the law taking effect.\" A recent opinion piece in the Washington Post called the called referred to the \"Second Amendment sanctuary\" movement as \"ugly\" and \"disturbing.\" Seth Lipsky, founding editor of The New York Sun, argued that is, in fact, the opposite. \"I would start with just how basic and important the Second Amendment right is,\" said Lipsky. \"This is a really basic right and predates the Constitution.\" \"I think it's very significant that Sheriff Carter and every other sheriff in the United States must -- must it's required by our Constitution -- swear to support the Constitution,\" he continued. \"So if a sheriff is confronted with a law that he thinks is conflicting with the constitution he's sworn to support\" they must be taken seriously          Lipsky concluded by saying that that U.S. Supreme Court must do more to settle disputes over the Second Amendment, because the debate is coming to a head in Virginia and around the country. \"What the sheriffs are doing in Virginia -- they're not alone,\" said Lipsky. \"There are others in the state of Washington -- some of these western states. This has been a movement already. ... This is a serious question. And the Supreme Court has moved by inches or microns, and it's really shocking.\" To watch all of \"Deep Dive\" go to medianame Nation and sign up today.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Gun control is just the start.          Now that the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates are controlled by Democrats for the first time in a generation, the legislature has the votes to move the state to the left, and gun control is at the top of their agenda. One bill mandates background checks for private sales of firearms, another prohibits the purchase of more than one handgun per month, and a third allows municipalities to ban firearms from public spaces and events. On Tuesday, a day after a large, peaceful crowd gathered outside the capitol building in Richmond, Va. to protest the bills, the state Senate took up “red-flag” legislation that would allow any attorney or law-enforcement official to apply for an emergency judicial order to “prohibit a person who poses a substantial risk of injury to himself or others from purchasing, possessing, or transporting a firearm.”          Gun control, though, is only part of the Democratic legislature’s agenda.          To pull the state’s economic policy to the left, Virginia Democrats have proposed measures to weaken the state’s right-to-work law, curb greenhouse-gas emissions, and raise the minimum wage.          To do the same for its social policy, they’ve introduced a bill that would repeal conscience protections for Catholic and other religious adoption agencies, effectively shutting those agencies down, and a bill that would require all public elementary and secondary schools to allow students who identify as transgender to participate on the sports teams and use the locker-rooms and showers of their preference.          On abortion, one bill would remove parental–consent requirements, 24-hour waiting periods, and ultrasound requirements. Another bill would declare that a “pregnant person has a fundamental right to choose to carry a pregnancy to term, give birth to a child, or terminate a pregnancy.” Yet another proposes a constitutional amendment enshrining a right to abortion: “an individual’s right to personal reproductive autonomy is central to the enjoyment of life and liberty and shall not be denied or infringed upon unless justified by a compelling interest of the Commonwealth and achieved by the least restrictive means.” When the budget comes up for debate, Democrats will have the opportunity to provide taxpayer funding of elective abortions.          Opponents of the flurry of bills essentially have only two things to give them hope. The first is Virginia’s short legislative period: The Virginia constitution gives the General Assembly only 60 days (including weekends) to hold its legislative session in even-numbered years, and only 30 days in odd-numbered years. Virginia Democrats have already chewed up about a quarter of the current 60-day session with their gun-control bills and the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. Each house of the Virginia legislature has only three more weeks until the February 11 deadline to act on its own legislation. The clock is ticking.          The other potential break on the legislature’s progressive ambitions is the reluctance of Senate Democrats, who only control the upper chamber 21–19, to push the envelope too far. Senate Democratic fears of a backlash among voters outside of Northern Virginia could be detected last week when Virginia’s Senate Judiciary Committee killed an assault-weapons ban. But Virginia Republicans caution that a slightly watered-down version of the ban is still very much alive in the House of Delegates and might be able to win passage in the Senate. Three weeks isn’t much time for Democrats to pass their wish list of left-wing bills, but it could certainly be enough time. Conservatives must hope that the potential long-term political consequences deter them from doing so.\n",
       "1189                                                          In Virginia, Terry McAuliffe Breaks the Constitution to Plump the Democratic Vote  In what is likely an unconstitutional state action seemingly calculated to ensure that the purple state of Virginia goes blue in the November election, Governor Terry McAuliffe (D.) signed an order on Friday restoring the voting rights of 206,000 ex-felons in Virginia, including those convicted of murder, armed robbery, rape, sexual assault, and other violent crimes. The order also restores their right to sit on a jury, become a notary, and even serve in elected office.          McAuliffe believes that ex-felons can be trusted to make decisions in the ballot booth and the jury box but apparently not to own a gun. He draws the line at restoring their Second Amendment rights; that would be a bridge too far. His order specifically does not restore their “right to ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.” And while his order requires that felons complete probation and parole before enjoying restoration of their rights, it applies regardless of whether they have paid any court fines or restitution to victims.          What McAuliffe entirely dismisses is the principle that if you won’t follow the law yourself, you can’t demand a role in making the law for everyone else, which is what you do when you vote. Restoring a felon’s right to vote should be done not automatically, as soon as he has completed his sentence, but carefully, on a case-by-case basis, after he has shown that he has really turned over a new leaf. The unfortunate truth is that many people who walk out of prison will be walking back in; recidivism rates are high. We have both testified before Congress and written about this problem. Governor McAuliffe may be happy as long as the ex-felons who can now vote just don’t walk back into prison before November.          Having a waiting period, examining each ex-felon’s application for restoration of rights carefully and individually, and differentiating between violent and nonviolent crimes is exactly the system that Virginia had — at least until Friday’s order. In a three-page summary released by the governor’s office, McAuliffe asserts that any claim that he doesn’t have the authority to grant a blanket restoration of rights is “far-outside the weight of constitutional authority across the nation and would read into the text of the Virginia Constitution words that simply are not there.” This is just legal gibberish — the weight of constitutional authority “across the nation” has no bearing on interpreting the Virginia constitution. McAuliffe is reading into that constitution authority he does not have.          That isn’t just our opinion; it is the opinion of prior governors and attorneys general of both political parties. For example, on January 15, 2010, Mark Rubin, the counselor for former Virginia governor Tim Kaine (D., now a U.S. senator), sent a letter on the governor’s behalf to the ACLU, saying that Kaine did not have the executive power “to grant a blanket restoration of voting rights,” which the ACLU had requested. Kaine supported restoration of voting rights but refused to act because his counsel’s view was that the “better argument” was that the powers in the Virginia constitutional provision on clemency (Article 5, Section 12) “are meant to apply in particular cases to named individuals.” In fact, “a blanket order restoring the voting rights of everyone would be a rewrite of the law. . . . The notion that the Constitution of the Commonwealth could be rewritten via executive order is troubling.”          Similarly, then–attorney general Ken Cuccinelli (R.) appointed the Rights Restoration Advisory Committee to examine this issue. The committee included not only several Commonwealth Attorneys (i.e., the district attorneys of Virginia counties) and a professor from George Mason University but also Ashley Taylor Jr., a former commissioner on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and Paul Goldman, the former senior adviser to Doug Wilder (D.), the first African-American governor of Virginia.          On May 10, 2013, the committee issued a report concluding that the governor does not have constitutional authority to “institute by executive order” a complete “restoration of rights for all convicted felons in the Commonwealth of Virginia.” Why? Because his clemency power in Article 5 must be harmonized with Article 2, Section 1, which provides that “no person who has been convicted of a felony shall be qualified to vote unless his civil rights have been restored.” If, instead of acting individually to consider each “person” and “his civil rights,” the governor issues a blanket restoration, such “altering [of] the public policy of the Commonwealth as regards the disenfranchisement of persons convicted of felonies clearly would be a legislative act, not an administrative act.” It would be “difficult” for a court to “sustain a Governor’s exercise of [his] clemency power in so sweeping a manner that the Constitution’s general policy of disenfranchisement of felons is voided.”          Yet that is exactly what McAuliffe attempts to do through his executive order, in a violation of the separation of powers. He is acting like a superlegislator in voiding the policy that has existed in Virginia “in one form or another since the [Virginia] Constitution of 1830,” according to the Cuccinelli’s report. (The New York Times incorrectly reported that the policy dated only to the Civil War; the Richmond Times-Dispatch, to the state’s 1902 constitution. Conversely, the current constitution was actually written in 1971, and no evidence has been cited that there was any discriminatory intent in it.)          As was completely predictable, McAuliffe played the race card on Friday, saying he was rectifying Virginia’s “long and sad history” of suppressing African-American voting power. This is a bogus and demagogic claim about a policy that applies equally to all felons regardless of race and that was established when black Virginians couldn’t even vote. Similar false claims about the history and origin of felon disenfranchisement have been made in numerous discrimination lawsuits that have been filed under the Voting Rights Act but have been uniformly unsuccessful.          Supreme Court precedent is that such a provision can be overturned as unconstitutional if it was adopted or applied with a racially discriminatory intent. If evidence existed that the Virginia law was racially discriminatory in its origins or application, many well-funded civil-rights advocacy organizations, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, would be eager to challenge it. The lack of successful challenges in Virginia indicates that such evidence does not exist. As always, liberals want to equate disparate impact with racial discrimination, and it just ain’t so.          It is estimated that McAuliffe’s action will add 3.8 percent to the 5.4 million registered voters in Virginia. That may not seem like a lot, but McAuliffe knows very well that Virginia today is a swing state with recent statewide elections that have been decided by a very small margin. In 2013, the current attorney general, Mark Herring (D.), won his race by only 907 votes. Former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell (R.) won his prior post as attorney general by only 360 votes in 2005. Even the Washington Post, which applauded McAuliffe’s action, acknowledged there is “no doubt” about the “political dimension” in this move by “a Democrat and longtime friend and fundraiser for Bill and Hillary Clinton” — namely, that it “grant[s] Democrats a crucial edge in a swing state ahead of November’s presidential election.”          McAuliffe is continuing a pattern. Last year he vetoed a bill that would have helped clean up voter-registration lists. The bill required county court clerks to send to local election officials information about individuals who were excused from jury duty because they were not U.S. citizens or were no longer residents of Virginia. McAuliffe seems intent on making sure that ineligible and illegal voters can continue to vote.          He is following the example set by President Obama: If you don’t like a law or a constitutional limit on your authority, just ignore it. Rewrite, change, or bend it. The New York Times inadvertently gave the game away when it said that McAuliffe’s “action effectively overturns a Civil War–era provision in the state’s Constitution.”          McAuliffe’s willingness to do anything (and to say anything) to achieve partisan political goals shows a complete contempt for the rule of law and for the constitutional republic that is the United States. What a sad day for the great state that was the home of Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, James Madison, George Mason, and the father of our country, George Washington.

       "      <td>Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) on Monday said an intelligence official’s complaint that President Trump sought help from Ukraine in the 2020 elections “is starting to seem like a political setup.”          Cheney tweeted a clip of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) appearing to admit she knew what was in the transcript of a July 25 Trump phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky even before the White House released the transcript of the call last Wednesday.          Pelosi, in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS News 60 Minutes, said Trump called her and they discussed the phone call before the transcript was released.          According to the New York Times, Trump and Pelosi’s phone call took place on Tuesday. The White House released the transcript on Wednesday.          But Pelosi said during the interview about her call with Trump, “He told me it was perfect. There was nothing in the call. But I know what was in the call. I mean, we — it was in the public domain.”          When Trump and Pelosi had spoken Tuesday, the call was not yet “in the public domain.”          Fred Fleitz, a former CIA analyst and chief of staff to former National Security Adviser John Bolton, has questioned whether the intelligence official who lodged a whistleblower complaint against Trump had help writing the complaint from Democrat lawmakers or their staff members.          He wrote in a New York Post op-ed on Thursday:          I am very familiar with transcripts of presidential phone calls since I edited and processed dozens of them when I worked for the NSC. I also know a lot about intelligence whistleblowers from my time with the CIA. My suspicions grew this morning when I saw the declassified whistleblowing complaint. It appears to be written by a law professor and includes legal references and detailed footnotes. It also has an unusual legalistic reference on how this complaint should be classified. From my experience, such an extremely polished whistleblowing complaint is unheard of. This document looks as if this leaker had outside help, possibly from congressional members or staff. Moreover, it looks like more than a coincidence that this complaint surfaced and was directed to the House Intelligence Committee just after Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), an outspoken opponent of President Trump, expressed numerous complaints in August 2019 accusing President Trump of abusing aid to Ukraine to hurt Joe Biden. This includes an August 28 tweet that closely resembled the whistleblowing complaint. House Republicans need to ask the whistleblower under oath whether he spoke to the press or Congress about his complaint.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Nancy Pelosi's wretched, saccharine speech fits her shoddy impeachment</td>\n",
       "      <td>Nancy Pelosi began the impeachment debate Wednesday afternoon with a wretchedly written speech proclaiming herself \"solemn\" and \"sad,\" and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.          As unwoke as it is to recite the Pledge (probably racist by the Left's current rules), what's truly shocking is that Pelosi didn't bother to prepare anything substantive or even any compelling rhetoric for her speech. If you literally begin your speech about impeachment by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, it means that you assigned your junior speechwriter to write this speech, probably the night before.          Grave moments call upon leaders to make serious arguments — to make their oratory match the moment. That can be done in many ways. Lincoln did it at Gettysburg with honest gravity and brevity. Reagan did it at the Brandenburg Gate with directness. Churchill, Kennedy, and the other leaders of last century, who faced actually \"solemn\" moments, rose to the occasion by injecting poetry, originality, and eloquence.          Pelosi, in contrast, kicked off her supposedly grave impeachment with a string of half-relevant quotations and piles and piles of melodrama (at one point she uttered the words \"dancing with angels\"). Her party responded with forced applause.          It was a shoddy speech to begin a rushed and shoddy impeachment process.          There are tons of problems with the Trump administration, including President Trump's use of the federal government to enrich his own business. But this isn't about any actual misconduct. Democrats arrived for this Congress on Day One promising to impeach Trump. They failed in their first effort when the Mueller report came up empty, and ever since, they have been scrambling for another reason to do what they were going to do anyway. As a result, they find themselves in the role of the kid who had to do his homework assignment on the bus ride to school.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Neal: Democrats, Lighthizer have resolved some USMCA issues</td>\n",
       "      <td>Neal did not specify which areas had been worked out but said the administration and lawmakers’ staff members will work intensely over the two-week congressional break. The goal is that when lawmakers return to Washington they’ll be able to see “the goal line,” Neal said.          Neal also indicated that USTR’s reaction this morning to Democrats’ counteroffer was “favorable.” But he noted that “they still have to digest it.” USTR officials could not be immediately reached for comment.          House Democrats and Lighthizer have been in formal talks since June to strike a deal that would allow for Speaker Nancy Pelosi to put the USMCA up for a vote. Pelosi, for her part, reiterated Thursday that Democrats remained on a “continued path to yes.”          “There is progress being made,” Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), one of the working group members, adding in a baseball reference that he feels negotiations are \"entering the sixth inning.\"          But he said there are still worries — separate from negotiations with the Trump administration — about whether Mexico will follow through on implementing its landmark labor reform law. Lawmakers are concerned that Mexico’s proposed annual budget does not reflect the amount needed for the required changes.          “This has never been viewed as a slam dunk,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), a member of the working group. “But I think what’s important is that if we weren’t [working to get to yes] we wouldn’t be continuing to meet.”          The Trump administration, Republicans and business groups are pushing for USMCA to be put up for a vote in Congress this fall. Democrats have said they hope that they’ll be able to get a deal done this year, even as the House dives into an impeachment inquiry.          Asked if the goal remained to pass USMCA this year, Neal said yes.          “I wouldn’t say we’re on the precipice, but the job is to get to the precipice but not over the edge,” Neal said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In between the insistence on impeachment as a dire national security issue and then the holding of the articles, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave a slight hint into why she’s been going gung-ho for so long, so viciously, yet so utterly devoid and defiant of facts, against President Donald Trump: It’s personal. It’s Pelosi’s way of marking this president for life. “This president is impeached for life regardless of any gamesmanship on the part of Mitch McConnell,” she said on “This Week” on ABC. A few moments later, she added, “There is nothing the Senate can do that can ever erase that.”          What an odd little quip. It’s the type of thing a scorned woman might say of a cheating husband after a nasty divorce that didn’t exactly go her way: “Well, at least his reputation is tainted.” Or: “At least his coworkers know what a piece of [bleep] he is.”          Twitter was quick to pick up on the strangeness, too, trending #ImpeachedForLife shortly after her comments. But Pelosi’s remarks are illuminating because they underscore her personal distaste for Trump the man, as well as Trump the president. They say, ha ha, you may have won with a Republican-dominated Senate, but you haven’t won in the history books. In the end, in Pelosi’s mind, she gets her revenge. But really, that’s hardly a demeanor fitting a speaker. And it’s certainly not an attitude that serves the American people and the Constitution well — or first.

       "151            Nancy Pelosi's wretched, saccharine speech fits her shoddy impeachment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nancy Pelosi began the impeachment debate Wednesday afternoon with a wretchedly written speech proclaiming herself \"solemn\" and \"sad,\" and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.          As unwoke as it is to recite the Pledge (probably racist by the Left's current rules), what's truly shocking is that Pelosi didn't bother to prepare anything substantive or even any compelling rhetoric for her speech. If you literally begin your speech about impeachment by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, it means that you assigned your junior speechwriter to write this speech, probably the night before.          Grave moments call upon leaders to make serious arguments — to make their oratory match the moment. That can be done in many ways. Lincoln did it at Gettysburg with honest gravity and brevity. Reagan did it at the Brandenburg Gate with directness. Churchill, Kennedy, and the other leaders of last century, who faced actually \"solemn\" moments, rose to the occasion by injecting poetry, originality, and eloquence.          Pelosi, in contrast, kicked off her supposedly grave impeachment with a string of half-relevant quotations and piles and piles of melodrama (at one point she uttered the words \"dancing with angels\"). Her party responded with forced applause.          It was a shoddy speech to begin a rushed and shoddy impeachment process.          There are tons of problems with the Trump administration, including President Trump's use of the federal government to enrich his own business. But this isn't about any actual misconduct. Democrats arrived for this Congress on Day One promising to impeach Trump. They failed in their first effort when the Mueller report came up empty, and ever since, they have been scrambling for another reason to do what they were going to do anyway. As a result, they find themselves in the role of the kid who had to do his homework assignment on the bus ride to school.\n",

The goal is that when lawmakers return to Washington they’ll be able to see “the goal line,” Neal said.          Neal also indicated that USTR’s reaction this morning to Democrats’ counteroffer was “favorable.” But he noted that “they still have to digest it.” USTR officials could not be immediately reached for comment.          House Democrats and Lighthizer have been in formal talks since June to strike a deal that would allow for Speaker Nancy Pelosi to put the USMCA up for a vote. Pelosi, for her part, reiterated Thursday that Democrats remained on a “continued path to yes.”          “There is progress being made,” Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), one of the working group members, adding in a baseball reference that he feels negotiations are \"entering the sixth inning.\"          But he said there are still worries — separate from negotiations with the Trump administration — about whether Mexico will follow through on implementing its landmark labor reform law. Lawmakers are concerned that Mexico’s proposed annual budget does not reflect the amount needed for the required changes.          “This has never been viewed as a slam dunk,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), a member of the working group. “But I think what’s important is that if we weren’t [working to get to yes] we wouldn’t be continuing to meet.”          The Trump administration, Republicans and business groups are pushing for USMCA to be put up for a vote in Congress this fall. Democrats have said they hope that they’ll be able to get a deal done this year, even as the House dives into an impeachment inquiry.          Asked if the goal remained to pass USMCA this year, Neal said yes.          “I wouldn’t say we’re on the precipice, but the job is to get to the precipice but not over the edge,” Neal said.\n",

It’s Pelosi’s way of marking this president for life. “This president is impeached for life regardless of any gamesmanship on the part of Mitch McConnell,” she said on “This Week” on ABC. A few moments later, she added, “There is nothing the Senate can do that can ever erase that.”          What an odd little quip. It’s the type of thing a scorned woman might say of a cheating husband after a nasty divorce that didn’t exactly go her way: “Well, at least his reputation is tainted.” Or: “At least his coworkers know what a piece of [bleep] he is.”          Twitter was quick to pick up on the strangeness, too, trending #ImpeachedForLife shortly after her comments. But Pelosi’s remarks are illuminating because they underscore her personal distaste for Trump the man, as well as Trump the president. They say, ha ha, you may have won with a Republican-dominated Senate, but you haven’t won in the history books. In the end, in Pelosi’s mind, she gets her revenge. But really, that’s hardly a demeanor fitting a speaker. And it’s certainly not an attitude that serves the American people and the Constitution well — or first.

       "      <td>White House wants Senate trial rules to include ability to dismiss Trump charges</td>\n",
       "      <td>Republicans are debating including in the Senate resolution, which would govern the rules of the trial, a provision to dismiss the charges, something that would require 51 votes and would stop the trial in its tracks.          But moving ahead with a dismissal vote could put Republicans up for reelection in a tough spot if they are seen as moving too quickly to dismiss the case. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could not afford to lose more than two votes -- and GOP sources say the Kentucky Republican currently does not have enough votes to simply dismiss the case.          McConnell has made clear to his colleagues that he wants Trump to emerge victorious in the trial and is not willing to hold a vote that could fail, sources said. He's also keenly aware of what a vote to dismiss would look like politically, according to Republican senators, and has shepherded his conference away from the idea for several weeks.          Once the trial has begun, the Senate can vote on the merits of the articles of impeachment and choose to acquit Trump, something that can be done with only 34 votes because the Constitution requires 67 votes to convict the President and remove him from office. GOP proponents of this move argue Trump would have a stronger argument to say he was exonerated on the merits of the case, rather than simply relying on a procedural vote to dismiss the charges. Trump, though, might have to wait longer for a vote on acquittal to occur.          Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of McConnell's leadership team, said Monday he would prefer a vote to acquit the President on the merits, rather than seek a quick vote to dismiss the charges. \"That would be my advice. Let both sides have their say and have their vote.\" And Cornyn downplayed a weekend tweet from Trump calling for an \"outright dismissal.\" \"At different times, the President has expressed different views,\" Cornyn said. \"I wouldn't get too distracted by an intervening tweet.\" While Republicans are short of the votes to dismiss the charges, the issue remains a point of discussion due to McConnell's insistence that the initial rules of the trial hew closely to those used in President Bill Clinton's trial in 1999 . That resolution included a motion to dismiss, which failed. Republican senators this time around have been debating whether to remove it entirely, or push it further back in the proceedings than where it was structured then, senators familiar with the discussions said. The White House wants to keep the motion to dismiss in play because \"there's no reason to take options off the table at the beginning of the whole process,\" said one source familiar with the discussions. McConnell has counseled Republicans privately that they can decide how to proceed after both the House Democratic impeachment managers and President's defense team make their cases, followed by questions from senators. At that point, GOP senators must decide whether to allow witnesses, seek to acquit the President or move to dismiss the case. \"Yes, I am,\" Sen. Lamar Alexander, a retiring Tennessee Republican and McConnell confidante, said Monday when asked if he's open to witnesses. \"What I think is important is we have a vote on whether we need additional documents and witnesses. And that would only be appropriate after we've heard the case and asked our questions.\" That tracks directly with the model McConnell has touted now for weeks: a Senate resolution governing the trial that follow the procedures of Clinton's trial. In that Clinton resolution, the Senate included a motion to dismiss the charges after opening arguments were delivered and after senators asked their questions. About two weeks into the Clinton trial, Democrats forced a vote to dismiss the charges. But that dismissal measure failed, 44-56, and the trial continued for another two-and-half weeks. McConnell hinted last week that the Senate resolution would include a provision allowing the charges to be dismissed, but senators said the talks about how to handle the motion to dismiss still hadn't been finalized. \"We're going to have a similar resolution,\" McConnell told reporters. \"It may not be word for word, exactly the same, but a similar resolution. And we'll be glad to show it to you when -- when we unveil it.\" McConnell fueled Democratic concerns about dismissing the charges outright when he signed onto a resolution sponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, that would allow a senator to offer a motion to dismiss if the House did not transmit the articles of impeachment within 25 days. The viability of Hawley's resolution was viewed as limited to impossible -- it would require a Senate rule change, which would take 67 votes to occur. Republicans only control 53 seats in the chamber. McConnell could move to drop the vote threshold to 51, but it would require him to \"go nuclear,\" or move to eliminate the legislative filibuster, something he has long opposed. A source familiar with McConnell's decision to support the resolution said he backed \"the spirit\" of Hawley's idea given the frustration over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to hold onto the articles for more than three weeks, but wasn't planning to push forward on it given its prospects. Pelosi's about to hit send on the impeachment articles But McConnell's decision to sign onto the idea drew sharp criticism from Pelosi, who demanded to see the Senate resolution and understand how the dismissal provision would be structured before sending over the articles of impeachment that would initiate the trial. She ultimately relented and indicated that the articles would be sent over this week. ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Dismissing is a coverup ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Over the weekend, Trump argued that having a trial would add credibility to the Democrats' case, calling for a dismissal of the charges. \"Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, 'no pressure' Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have,\" Trump tweeted. \"I agree!\" This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Capitol Hill reporters protest expected restrictions on media access during Senate impeachment trial</td>\n",
       "      <td>The letter — addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) — said Capitol security officials are considering measures that are all but certain to make it harder for journalists to report on the trial and question senators about their actions.          A magnetometer in the Senate press gallery will require reporters to trickle into the chamber one at a time. Electronic devices will be banned, leaving reporters to scuttle in and out of the room to send tweets and emails. Reporters will be placed in pens, roping them off and restricting their ability to speak freely with senators as they enter and exit.          “Currently,” Wire tweeted, “we can walk with Senators as they enter the chamber, wait for them outside of meetings or lunches. It leads to a diversity of voices. Penning us means people across the country might not hear from their senator.”          Officials have also proposed limiting video coverage of the arrival of the articles of impeachment to a single pool camera with no audio, she said.          “These potential restrictions fail to acknowledge what currently works on Capitol Hill, or the way the American public expects to be able to follow a vital news event about their government in the digital age,” the committee’s letter read.          Details about the nature and scope of the restrictions under consideration remained unclear, as neither the Senate sergeant at arms nor the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, which are responsible for them, has issued a formal document.          “You’ll have to decide where’s the best place to watch; it’s like watching a football game,” Blunt said. “Where’s the best place to watch it?”          Blunt told the Star that while most of the trial will be broadcast, other segments will be closed, in line with procedures during the trial of President Bill Clinton in early 1999. “I mean closed session,” he said. “I mean there will be nobody there but senators and essential staff. No cameras, no C-SPAN, no coverage.”          He said that “part of the decision about access” for reporters to senators “will be driven by how quickly you can clear the room” for the closed sessions, “so you can have that debate and get people back into the room so you can move forward.”          Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, called the restrictions “a big mistake” in comments to reporters after Tuesday night’s Democratic candidate debate in Des Moines, where she is campaigning for the party’s presidential nomination.          The correspondents’ committee said members raised concerns with the sergeant at arms and the Rules Committee. “But decisions are being made quickly as plans for the trial are completed,” the letter read, “and we are hearing that nearly every suggestion has been rejected without an explanation of how the restrictions contribute to safety rather than simply limit coverage of the trial.”          News of the restrictions prompted alarm online from reporters, with some protesting the move as one that will effectively shield senators from scrutiny during the trial.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Some House Democrats push Pelosi to withhold impeachment articles, delay Senate trial</td>\n",
       "      <td>The gambit has gained some traction inside the left wing of the House Democratic Caucus this week. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said Wednesday, as his colleagues debated the impeachment articles on the House floor, that he has spoken to three dozen Democratic lawmakers who had expressed some level of enthusiasm for the idea of “rounding out the record and spending the time to do this right.”          Another Democrat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said there is “serious concern about whether there will be a fair trial on the Senate side” and acknowledged active talks about withholding the articles.          The notion has been most prominently advocated by Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor who has advised the House Judiciary Committee on the impeachment process. In a recent medianame op-ed, he wrote that “the public has a right to observe a meaningful trial rather than simply learn that the result is a verdict of not guilty.”          Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has asked McConnell to call several Trump administration witnesses, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. McConnell has dismissed those requests and signaled that he expects to hold a relatively short trial that will end with a summary dismissal of the impeachment charges.          Republicans have scoffed at the notion of the House withholding the articles, noting it hardly counts as leverage to deny the GOP the ability to remove a president that the party wants to keep in place. Some aides further argued that withholding the articles would only fuel Republican arguments that Democrats are engaged in a partisan abuse of the Constitution.          But Democratic leaders may be forced to deal with the issue in the coming days. Blumenauer said he had already raised it with Pelosi (Calif.), House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (Md.) and other top party leaders.          Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Hoyer did not rule out the idea: “It’s an interesting proposal. I don’t think that that’s the path we will follow, but that does not mean we will immediately deliver it. There are considerations related to other legislation.”          A senior Democratic aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations said the impeachment articles will not be immediately transmitted to the Senate on Wednesday. Rather, they will be held until Pelosi names impeachment managers, the House members who will present the case for Trump’s removal in the Senate.          “There will be a debate and vote on that resolution” naming the managers, the aide said. If a significant number of Democrats refuse to vote for that resolution, they could force the issue.          The timing of that vote is unclear; the House is expected to recess for the winter holidays as soon as Thursday and not return until Jan. 7.          Blumenauer said that if McConnell does not agree to call the Democratic witnesses and stage a fair trial, Democrats could simply hold on to the articles indefinitely and continue to investigate Trump. The House is involved in multiple court cases seeking documents and testimony that have yet to be resolved.          “Who knows what would happen to augment the record? This ought to be able to play out,” he said. “There’s no advantage to rushing this.”          But the notion of prolonging the impeachment process indefinitely is almost certain to infuriate House members from competitive districts, who have pushed Pelosi for months to keep the investigation focused and limited to Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine.          Blumenauer declined to discuss whether members interested in the gambit would withhold their votes on naming managers to force the issue: “I’m not interested in sparking controversy in the caucus,” he said.</td>\n",

It was their final, most essential command.\" – George Orwell, \"1984\"          The Senate impeachment trial of President Trump ended not with a bang but a whimper. What different outcome could one expect from a trial without so much as a single witness, a single document, any cross-examination or a defendant respectful enough to show up? Law students are taught early on that a trial is not a grudge match or an ordeal; it is a search for the truth. Trial lawyers know that cross-examination is the most effective truth-testing tool available to them. But the search for the truth requires witnesses, and when the command from Senate Republican leaders came down that there shall be no witnesses, the truth-telling mission of Trump's trial was radically transformed into a steamroller of political power. GREGG JARRETT: TRUMP ACQUITTAL IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS A HUMILIATING DEFEAT FOR PARTISAN DEMOCRATS          And in its wake is a Congress ceding power to the presidency, almost as if the states had ratified a constitutional amendment redefining the impeachment language to permit a president to engage in high crimes and misdemeanors so long as he believes that they are in the national interest and so long as his party has an iron-clad grip on the Senate. How could presidential crimes be in the national interest? Here is the backstory. When the House of Representatives voted in favor of two articles of impeachment against Trump, it characterized his lawlessness as contempt of Congress and an abuse of power. The contempt of Congress consisted of Trump's orders to subordinates to disregard congressional subpoenas. Both Republican- and Democratic-controlled Houses of Representatives have deemed such presidential instructions in an impeachment inquiry as impeachable per se. The abuse allegations address Trump's solicitation of assistance for his reelection campaign from a foreign government by holding up the release of $391 million in military aid to the same foreign government. These funds were congressionally appropriated and ordered to be paid by legislation that Trump had signed into law. Federal law prohibits such solicitation as criminal and prohibits government officials from seeking personal favors in return for performing their governmental duties. The latter is bribery. Because the solicitation that Trump committed was a crime against the government, it is among those referred to when the Constitution was written as a \"high\" crime. High crimes are a constitutional basis for impeachment, along with bribery and treason. The evidence that Trump did this is overwhelming and beyond a reasonable doubt, and no one with firsthand knowledge denied it. Numerous government officials recounted that the presidential leverage of $391 million in U.S. assistance for a personal political favor did occur and the government's own watchdog concluded that it was indisputably unlawful. The favor Trump sought was an announcement by the Ukrainian government of the commencement of an investigation of Trump's potential presidential foe, former Vice President Joe Biden. While the Senate was hearing House prosecution managers argue their case, and Trump's lawyers challenged those arguments, The New York Times revealed that John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, had authored an as yet unpublished book demonstrating that the House case against Trump was true. True because, unlike the senators who shut their eyes and ears at Trump's trial, Bolton saw for himself the presidential tit-for-tat machinations that the House had alleged and, if proven, were criminal and impeachable. The Times also revealed the existence of 24 emails sent by Trump aides manifesting indisputably his lawless behavior. But the emails are secret. At the same time, two signal events occurred in the impeachment trial. The first was an argument by Trump's lawyers that every president seeking reelection believes his victory will be in the national interest and thus all presidential efforts toward that victory are constitutional and lawful. This morally bankrupt, intellectually dishonest argument – which effectively resuscitates from history's graveyard President Richard Nixon’s logic that \"when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal\" because the president is above the law – must have resonated with Senate Republican leaders. The leaders coerced their Senate Republican colleagues into embracing the view that – since the president did not want Bolton to testify or White House emails to be revealed – they must bar all witnesses and documents. The second signal event was shameful. It was the 51 to 49 Senate vote to bar witnesses and documents from the trial. Do innocent people behave this way? If Trump really believes he did not commit any crimes and any impeachable offenses, why would he orchestrate blocking evidence? And who – having taken an oath to do \"impartial justice\" – would close their eyes to the truth? How could such a marathon of speeches possibly be considered a trial? Trump will luxuriate in his victory. But the personal victory for him is a legal assault on the Constitution. The president has taken an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. Instead, he has trashed it. By manipulating Senate Republicans to bar firsthand evidence and keep it from senatorial and public scrutiny, Trump and his Senate collaborators have insulated him and future presidents from the moral and constitutional truism that no president is above the law.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Now to the new impeachment standoff in Washington Democrats and Republicans are clashing over a timeline for the trial in the senate. President trop is looking for the GOP senate for vindication but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It's throwing a wrench in the plans medianame the nest Iraq or Tara has the latest from Washington and that's good morning. Good mornings and in Canada Democrats are hoping to have witnesses testify as part of president trying to send trial that Republicans have already rejected that request to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hoping. Threatening to possibly delay president trumps trial. Could give her leverage. History put on hold president from becoming just the third president in US history to be impeached. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now refusing to take the next steps. Saying she wolf said articles of impeachment over to the set net. Until majority leader Mitch McConnell reveals with the president's trial will look like. Act founders owning both the constitution. They suspected that there could be a blow president. I don't think they suspected that with have a role president and rogue leader in the senate at the same time. Democrats have been pushing to hear from four witnesses the White House had blocked from testifying. Including acting chief of staff make Maldini and former national security advisor John Bolton. The issue coming up at last night's democratic debate. It president trop. Thinks that he should not be impeached he should not scared to what or where his own witnesses. But McConnell has already rejected that request. Indicating he wants a speedy trial and that he's working in total coordination with the White House Democrats are hoping threatening to possibly delay trumps trial will give them leverage. But for now at least Republicans aren't waiting. Looks like prosecutors are getting cold fate. In front of the entire country. And second guessing whether that you don't want the go to trial. President chopper responding on Twitter writing Pelosi is afraid to present impeachment to the senate. And adding so after Democrats gave me no due process in the house no lawyers no witnesses no nothing. They now want to tell the senate how to run their trial we think that what they did is unconstitutional. And lawmakers are hoping to have that senate trial begin the week of January 6 but that will all depend on when house speaker Pelosi decides to send those articles of impeachment. Over to the senate to name Kenneth.</td>\n",

       "61                         White House wants Senate trial rules to include ability to dismiss Trump charges  Republicans are debating including in the Senate resolution, which would govern the rules of the trial, a provision to dismiss the charges, something that would require 51 votes and would stop the trial in its tracks.          But moving ahead with a dismissal vote could put Republicans up for reelection in a tough spot if they are seen as moving too quickly to dismiss the case. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could not afford to lose more than two votes -- and GOP sources say the Kentucky Republican currently does not have enough votes to simply dismiss the case.          McConnell has made clear to his colleagues that he wants Trump to emerge victorious in the trial and is not willing to hold a vote that could fail, sources said. He's also keenly aware of what a vote to dismiss would look like politically, according to Republican senators, and has shepherded his conference away from the idea for several weeks.          Once the trial has begun, the Senate can vote on the merits of the articles of impeachment and choose to acquit Trump, something that can be done with only 34 votes because the Constitution requires 67 votes to convict the President and remove him from office. GOP proponents of this move argue Trump would have a stronger argument to say he was exonerated on the merits of the case, rather than simply relying on a procedural vote to dismiss the charges. Trump, though, might have to wait longer for a vote on acquittal to occur.          Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of McConnell's leadership team, said Monday he would prefer a vote to acquit the President on the merits, rather than seek a quick vote to dismiss the charges. \"That would be my advice. Let both sides have their say and have their vote.\" And Cornyn downplayed a weekend tweet from Trump calling for an \"outright dismissal.\" \"At different times, the President has expressed different views,\" Cornyn said. \"I wouldn't get too distracted by an intervening tweet.\" While Republicans are short of the votes to dismiss the charges, the issue remains a point of discussion due to McConnell's insistence that the initial rules of the trial hew closely to those used in President Bill Clinton's trial in 1999 . That resolution included a motion to dismiss, which failed. Republican senators this time around have been debating whether to remove it entirely, or push it further back in the proceedings than where it was structured then, senators familiar with the discussions said. The White House wants to keep the motion to dismiss in play because \"there's no reason to take options off the table at the beginning of the whole process,\" said one source familiar with the discussions. McConnell has counseled Republicans privately that they can decide how to proceed after both the House Democratic impeachment managers and President's defense team make their cases, followed by questions from senators. At that point, GOP senators must decide whether to allow witnesses, seek to acquit the President or move to dismiss the case. \"Yes, I am,\" Sen. Lamar Alexander, a retiring Tennessee Republican and McConnell confidante, said Monday when asked if he's open to witnesses. \"What I think is important is we have a vote on whether we need additional documents and witnesses. And that would only be appropriate after we've heard the case and asked our questions.\" That tracks directly with the model McConnell has touted now for weeks: a Senate resolution governing the trial that follow the procedures of Clinton's trial. In that Clinton resolution, the Senate included a motion to dismiss the charges after opening arguments were delivered and after senators asked their questions. About two weeks into the Clinton trial, Democrats forced a vote to dismiss the charges. But that dismissal measure failed, 44-56, and the trial continued for another two-and-half weeks. McConnell hinted last week that the Senate resolution would include a provision allowing the charges to be dismissed, but senators said the talks about how to handle the motion to dismiss still hadn't been finalized. \"We're going to have a similar resolution,\" McConnell told reporters. \"It may not be word for word, exactly the same, but a similar resolution. And we'll be glad to show it to you when -- when we unveil it.\" McConnell fueled Democratic concerns about dismissing the charges outright when he signed onto a resolution sponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, that would allow a senator to offer a motion to dismiss if the House did not transmit the articles of impeachment within 25 days. The viability of Hawley's resolution was viewed as limited to impossible -- it would require a Senate rule change, which would take 67 votes to occur. Republicans only control 53 seats in the chamber. McConnell could move to drop the vote threshold to 51, but it would require him to \"go nuclear,\" or move to eliminate the legislative filibuster, something he has long opposed. A source familiar with McConnell's decision to support the resolution said he backed \"the spirit\" of Hawley's idea given the frustration over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to hold onto the articles for more than three weeks, but wasn't planning to push forward on it given its prospects. Pelosi's about to hit send on the impeachment articles But McConnell's decision to sign onto the idea drew sharp criticism from Pelosi, who demanded to see the Senate resolution and understand how the dismissal provision would be structured before sending over the articles of impeachment that would initiate the trial. She ultimately relented and indicated that the articles would be sent over this week. ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Dismissing is a coverup ,\" Pelosi said Sunday on ABC. Over the weekend, Trump argued that having a trial would add credibility to the Democrats' case, calling for a dismissal of the charges. \"Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, 'no pressure' Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have,\" Trump tweeted. \"I agree!\" This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.\n",

Schumer (D-N.Y.) — said Capitol security officials are considering measures that are all but certain to make it harder for journalists to report on the trial and question senators about their actions.          A magnetometer in the Senate press gallery will require reporters to trickle into the chamber one at a time. Electronic devices will be banned, leaving reporters to scuttle in and out of the room to send tweets and emails. Reporters will be placed in pens, roping them off and restricting their ability to speak freely with senators as they enter and exit.          “Currently,” Wire tweeted, “we can walk with Senators as they enter the chamber, wait for them outside of meetings or lunches. It leads to a diversity of voices. Penning us means people across the country might not hear from their senator.”          Officials have also proposed limiting video coverage of the arrival of the articles of impeachment to a single pool camera with no audio, she said.          “These potential restrictions fail to acknowledge what currently works on Capitol Hill, or the way the American public expects to be able to follow a vital news event about their government in the digital age,” the committee’s letter read.          Details about the nature and scope of the restrictions under consideration remained unclear, as neither the Senate sergeant at arms nor the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, which are responsible for them, has issued a formal document.          “You’ll have to decide where’s the best place to watch; it’s like watching a football game,” Blunt said. “Where’s the best place to watch it?”          Blunt told the Star that while most of the trial will be broadcast, other segments will be closed, in line with procedures during the trial of President Bill Clinton in early 1999. “I mean closed session,” he said. “I mean there will be nobody there but senators and essential staff. No cameras, no C-SPAN, no coverage.”          He said that “part of the decision about access” for reporters to senators “will be driven by how quickly you can clear the room” for the closed sessions, “so you can have that debate and get people back into the room so you can move forward.”          Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, called the restrictions “a big mistake” in comments to reporters after Tuesday night’s Democratic candidate debate in Des Moines, where she is campaigning for the party’s presidential nomination.          The correspondents’ committee said members raised concerns with the sergeant at arms and the Rules Committee. “But decisions are being made quickly as plans for the trial are completed,” the letter read, “and we are hearing that nearly every suggestion has been rejected without an explanation of how the restrictions contribute to safety rather than simply limit coverage of the trial.”          News of the restrictions prompted alarm online from reporters, with some protesting the move as one that will effectively shield senators from scrutiny during the trial.\n",

Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said Wednesday, as his colleagues debated the impeachment articles on the House floor, that he has spoken to three dozen Democratic lawmakers who had expressed some level of enthusiasm for the idea of “rounding out the record and spending the time to do this right.”          Another Democrat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said there is “serious concern about whether there will be a fair trial on the Senate side” and acknowledged active talks about withholding the articles.          The notion has been most prominently advocated by Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor who has advised the House Judiciary Committee on the impeachment process. In a recent medianame op-ed, he wrote that “the public has a right to observe a meaningful trial rather than simply learn that the result is a verdict of not guilty.”          Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has asked McConnell to call several Trump administration witnesses, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. McConnell has dismissed those requests and signaled that he expects to hold a relatively short trial that will end with a summary dismissal of the impeachment charges.          Republicans have scoffed at the notion of the House withholding the articles, noting it hardly counts as leverage to deny the GOP the ability to remove a president that the party wants to keep in place. Some aides further argued that withholding the articles would only fuel Republican arguments that Democrats are engaged in a partisan abuse of the Constitution.          But Democratic leaders may be forced to deal with the issue in the coming days. Blumenauer said he had already raised it with Pelosi (Calif.), House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (Md.) and other top party leaders.          Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Hoyer did not rule out the idea: “It’s an interesting proposal. I don’t think that that’s the path we will follow, but that does not mean we will immediately deliver it. There are considerations related to other legislation.”          A senior Democratic aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations said the impeachment articles will not be immediately transmitted to the Senate on Wednesday. Rather, they will be held until Pelosi names impeachment managers, the House members who will present the case for Trump’s removal in the Senate.          “There will be a debate and vote on that resolution” naming the managers, the aide said. If a significant number of Democrats refuse to vote for that resolution, they could force the issue.          The timing of that vote is unclear; the House is expected to recess for the winter holidays as soon as Thursday and not return until Jan. 7.          Blumenauer said that if McConnell does not agree to call the Democratic witnesses and stage a fair trial, Democrats could simply hold on to the articles indefinitely and continue to investigate Trump. The House is involved in multiple court cases seeking documents and testimony that have yet to be resolved.          “Who knows what would happen to augment the record? This ought to be able to play out,” he said. “There’s no advantage to rushing this.”          But the notion of prolonging the impeachment process indefinitely is almost certain to infuriate House members from competitive districts, who have pushed Pelosi for months to keep the investigation focused and limited to Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine.          Blumenauer declined to discuss whether members interested in the gambit would withhold their votes on naming managers to force the issue: “I’m not interested in sparking controversy in the caucus,” he said.\n",
       "402  Judge Andrew Napolitano: Despite his impeachment trial acquittal, Trump clearly guilty of a high crime                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \"The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.\" – George Orwell, \"1984\"          The Senate impeachment trial of President Trump ended not with a bang but a whimper. What different outcome could one expect from a trial without so much as a single witness, a single document, any cross-examination or a defendant respectful enough to show up? Law students are taught early on that a trial is not a grudge match or an ordeal; it is a search for the truth. Trial lawyers know that cross-examination is the most effective truth-testing tool available to them. But the search for the truth requires witnesses, and when the command from Senate Republican leaders came down that there shall be no witnesses, the truth-telling mission of Trump's trial was radically transformed into a steamroller of political power. GREGG JARRETT: TRUMP ACQUITTAL IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS A HUMILIATING DEFEAT FOR PARTISAN DEMOCRATS          And in its wake is a Congress ceding power to the presidency, almost as if the states had ratified a constitutional amendment redefining the impeachment language to permit a president to engage in high crimes and misdemeanors so long as he believes that they are in the national interest and so long as his party has an iron-clad grip on the Senate. How could presidential crimes be in the national interest? Here is the backstory. When the House of Representatives voted in favor of two articles of impeachment against Trump, it characterized his lawlessness as contempt of Congress and an abuse of power. The contempt of Congress consisted of Trump's orders to subordinates to disregard congressional subpoenas. Both Republican- and Democratic-controlled Houses of Representatives have deemed such presidential instructions in an impeachment inquiry as impeachable per se. The abuse allegations address Trump's solicitation of assistance for his reelection campaign from a foreign government by holding up the release of $391 million in military aid to the same foreign government. These funds were congressionally appropriated and ordered to be paid by legislation that Trump had signed into law. Federal law prohibits such solicitation as criminal and prohibits government officials from seeking personal favors in return for performing their governmental duties. The latter is bribery. Because the solicitation that Trump committed was a crime against the government, it is among those referred to when the Constitution was written as a \"high\" crime. High crimes are a constitutional basis for impeachment, along with bribery and treason. The evidence that Trump did this is overwhelming and beyond a reasonable doubt, and no one with firsthand knowledge denied it. Numerous government officials recounted that the presidential leverage of $391 million in U.S. assistance for a personal political favor did occur and the government's own watchdog concluded that it was indisputably unlawful. The favor Trump sought was an announcement by the Ukrainian government of the commencement of an investigation of Trump's potential presidential foe, former Vice President Joe Biden. While the Senate was hearing House prosecution managers argue their case, and Trump's lawyers challenged those arguments, The New York Times revealed that John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, had authored an as yet unpublished book demonstrating that the House case against Trump was true. True because, unlike the senators who shut their eyes and ears at Trump's trial, Bolton saw for himself the presidential tit-for-tat machinations that the House had alleged and, if proven, were criminal and impeachable. The Times also revealed the existence of 24 emails sent by Trump aides manifesting indisputably his lawless behavior. But the emails are secret. At the same time, two signal events occurred in the impeachment trial. The first was an argument by Trump's lawyers that every president seeking reelection believes his victory will be in the national interest and thus all presidential efforts toward that victory are constitutional and lawful. This morally bankrupt, intellectually dishonest argument – which effectively resuscitates from history's graveyard President Richard Nixon’s logic that \"when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal\" because the president is above the law – must have resonated with Senate Republican leaders. The leaders coerced their Senate Republican colleagues into embracing the view that – since the president did not want Bolton to testify or White House emails to be revealed – they must bar all witnesses and documents. The second signal event was shameful. It was the 51 to 49 Senate vote to bar witnesses and documents from the trial. Do innocent people behave this way? If Trump really believes he did not commit any crimes and any impeachable offenses, why would he orchestrate blocking evidence? And who – having taken an oath to do \"impartial justice\" – would close their eyes to the truth? How could such a marathon of speeches possibly be considered a trial? Trump will luxuriate in his victory. But the personal victory for him is a legal assault on the Constitution. The president has taken an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. Instead, he has trashed it. By manipulating Senate Republicans to bar firsthand evidence and keep it from senatorial and public scrutiny, Trump and his Senate collaborators have insulated him and future presidents from the moral and constitutional truism that no president is above the law.\n",

President trop is looking for the GOP senate for vindication but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It's throwing a wrench in the plans medianame the nest Iraq or Tara has the latest from Washington and that's good morning. Good mornings and in Canada Democrats are hoping to have witnesses testify as part of president trying to send trial that Republicans have already rejected that request to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hoping. Threatening to possibly delay president trumps trial. Could give her leverage. History put on hold president from becoming just the third president in US history to be impeached. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now refusing to take the next steps. Saying she wolf said articles of impeachment over to the set net. Until majority leader Mitch McConnell reveals with the president's trial will look like. Act founders owning both the constitution. They suspected that there could be a blow president. I don't think they suspected that with have a role president and rogue leader in the senate at the same time. Democrats have been pushing to hear from four witnesses the White House had blocked from testifying. Including acting chief of staff make Maldini and former national security advisor John Bolton. The issue coming up at last night's democratic debate. It president trop. Thinks that he should not be impeached he should not scared to what or where his own witnesses. But McConnell has already rejected that request. Indicating he wants a speedy trial and that he's working in total coordination with the White House Democrats are hoping threatening to possibly delay trumps trial will give them leverage. But for now at least Republicans aren't waiting. Looks like prosecutors are getting cold fate. In front of the entire country. And second guessing whether that you don't want the go to trial. President chopper responding on Twitter writing Pelosi is afraid to present impeachment to the senate. And adding so after Democrats gave me no due process in the house no lawyers no witnesses no nothing. They now want to tell the senate how to run their trial we think that what they did is unconstitutional. And lawmakers are hoping to have that senate trial begin the week of January 6 but that will all depend on when house speaker Pelosi decides to send those articles of impeachment. Over to the senate to name Kenneth."

       "      <td>An Iranian businessman charged with exporting tons of carbon fiber, a controlled substance with military and nuclear uses, from the U.S. to Iran was sentenced to nearly four years in prison Thursday, the Justice Department announced. Behzad Pourghannad was extradited from Germany to face charges in July. He was charged with violating U.S. sanctions by circumventing export controls on carbon fiber, according to U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman of the Southern District of New York. Pourghannad pled guilty to the charges in August. DAUGHTER OF EX-FBI AGENT MISSING FOR OVER A DECADE IN IRAN THANKS TRUMP FOR 'CLEAR MESSAGE' TO TEHRAN          Carbon fiber can be used to make nose cones for long-range missiles and can be used to manufacture rotors in the centrifuges that enrich uranium. Iran in recent months has made numerous announcements that it would be violating international agreement to use advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium and increase its nuclear stockpile. IRAN ENRICHING URANIUM AT 'NOT DECLARED' SITE, UN NUCLEAR WATCHDOG SAYS          A United Nations nuclear watchdog revealed Monday that Iran is making good on that promise. Uranium of a man-made origin was found at a site not declared to inspectors. According to the announcement, Pourghannad and his co-conspirators, Ali Reza Shokri and Farzin Faridmanesh, lived and worked in Iran between 2008 and 2013. During that time they worked together to obtain the carbon fiber from the United States and secretly export it to Iran through third countries. Shokri procured the carbon fiber, Pourghannad served as the financial guarantor of the transactions and Faridmanesh served as the shipper. In the 2013 transaction alone, Pourghannad and Shokri negotiated for the purchase and shipment of more than five tons of carbon fiber to Iran by way of the nation of Georgia. Faridmanesh labeled the carbon fiber “acrylic” to sneak by U.S. export controls. The DOJ did not specify how much of the carbon fiber actually made it to Iran, or what would become of co-defendants Faridmanesh and Shokri.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Iran Acknowledges a Space Rocket Exploded Because of What Officials Called a Technical Malfunction</td>\n",
       "      <td>TEHRAN, Iran — Iran acknowledged for the first time on Monday that a rocket at its Imam Khomeini Space Center exploded after satellite photos showed the blast last week, with an official saying a technical malfunction during a test caused the explosion.          The comments by government spokesman Ali Rabiei were the first explanation offered by Iran for Thursday’s explosion, which came ahead of a planned satellite launch by the Islamic Republic that the U.S. has criticized.          Rabiei also criticized President Donald Trump for tweeting what appeared to be a surveillance photo of the aftermath of the explosion shot by a U.S. spy satellite.          The explosion marked the third failure involving a rocket at the Iranian center, which has raised suspicions of sabotage in Iran’s space program.          However, Rabiei dismissed that, saying that “this has been a technical matter and a technical error. Our experts unanimously say so.”          “The explosion happened at the launchpad and no satellite had yet been transferred to the launchpad,” Rabiei said. “It happened at a test site, not at the launch site.”          Commercially available satellite images by Planet Labs Inc. and Maxar Technologies showed a black plume of smoke rising above a launch pad Thursday, with what appeared to be the charred remains of a rocket and its launch stand. In previous days, satellite images had shown officials there repainted the launch pad blue.          The photo released Friday by Trump appeared to be a once-classified surveillance photo from American intelligence agencies. Analysts said the black rectangle in the photo’s upper-left-hand corner likely covered up the photo’s classification.          The image showed damaged vehicles around the launch pad, as well as damage done to the rocket’s launcher. It also clearly showed a large phrase written in Farsi on the pad: “National Product, National Power.”          “The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran,” Trump wrote in his tweet, identifying the rocket used. “I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One.”          Rabiei criticized Trump’s decision to tweet about the rocket explosion.          “We don’t understand why the U.S president tweets and posts satellite pictures with excitement. This is not understandable,” he said. “Maybe this is because lack of Iran-related subjects that they raise such issues.”          The blast followed two failed satellite launches of the Payam and Doosti in January and February. A separate fire at the Imam Khomeini Space Center in February also killed three researchers, authorities said at the time.          Over the past decade, Iran has sent several short-lived satellites into orbit and in 2013 launched a monkey into space.          Iran is preparing to launch the Nahid-1, a communication satellite, into space.          The U.S. alleges such satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution calling on Iran to undertake no activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.          Iran, which long has said it does not seek nuclear weapons, maintains its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component. Tehran also says it hasn’t violated the U.N. resolution as it only “called upon” Tehran not to conduct such tests.          The tests have taken on new importance to the U.S. amid the maximalist approach to Iran taken by President Donald Trump’s administration. Tensions have been high between the countries since Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from Iran’s nuclear deal over a year ago and imposed sanctions, including on Iran’s oil industry. Iran recently has begun to break the accord itself while trying to push Europe to help it sell oil abroad.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Last week, President Trump said the United States is “ready to embrace peace” with Iran after missile strikes on military bases in Iraq. His decision not to respond with military force may end up saving American lives, but it’s Israel that could end up suffering the most. And with new U.S. sanctions against Iran, Christians can’t overlook the importance of U.S. support of Israel in the fragile upcoming months.          Geographically, it’s far easier for Iran to retaliate against Israel than it is to strike the U.S. itself. And Iran has a history of using terrorist proxies to commit violence throughout the Middle East. While Iran may have a great deal to lose from a conventional war with the U.S., it has a lot less to lose by continuing its pattern of proxy attacks.          The Shiite Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which receives $700 million a year in funds from Iran, is considered by many to be “the most powerful Iranian proxy in the Middle East.” Hezbollah will almost certainly attack Israel if the situation escalates. Iran, not surprisingly, has threatened attacks in Israel and Dubai. In 2016, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps labeled an Iranian missile with “Israel must be wiped off the earth” in Hebrew. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has frequently called Israel a “cancerous tumor” that should be destroyed.          Hezbollah is a sophisticated network. It provides education, healthcare, and other services to its Lebanese Shiite constituents. It has already managed to build tunnels up to 22 stories deep from Lebanon to Israel. Between December 2018 and January 2019 alone, Israel located six such tunnels. Some were even outfitted with electricity, communications, and lighting.          Iran also provides hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, weapons, and training to other terrorist groups that threaten Israel, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.          Thanks to shared values and common strategic interests, the U.S. has a long history of solidarity with Israel, the only genuine democracy in the Middle East and one of the most valuable U.S. allies. American support for Israel in this precarious time is also a statement in support of freedom of religion and open access to the holy sites of the world’s major faiths.          Moreover, Israel’s intelligence service partners with the U.S. in many covert operations and intelligence missions. Israel buys billions of dollars in weapons from the U.S., and its location within the Middle East provides a strategic site for new weapons testing. Trade between the U.S. and Israel is currently at over $30 billion.          In the midst of fears surrounding our own country’s safety, it is imperative that we not forget about the security of our allies. Christians should be ardent in demanding that Israel’s safety be a priority for our government.          Timothy Head is executive director for the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition.</td>\n",

       "      <td>California-based man abducted by Iran while in Dubai, his family says</td>\n",
       "      <td>Dubai, United Arab Emirates — A California-based member of an Iranian militant opposition group in exile was abducted by Iran while staying in Dubai, his family said Tuesday.          The suspected cross-border abduction of Jamshid Sharmahd appears corroborated by mobile phone location data, shared by his family with The Associated Press, that suggests he was taken to neighboring Oman before heading to Iran.          Iran hasn't said how it detained Sharmahd, though the announcement came against the backdrop of covert actions conducted by Iran amid heightened tensions with the U.S. over Tehran's collapsing nuclear deal with world powers.          Iran accuses Sharmahd, 65, of Glendora, California of planning a 2008 attack on a mosque that killed 14 people and wounded over 200 others, as well as plotting other assaults through the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing. It aired an interview of him on state television - footage that resembled many other suspected coerced confessions broadcast by the Iranian government in the last decade.          His family, however, insists Sharmahd only served as a spokesman for the group and had nothing to do with any attacks in Iran. Sharmahd, who supports restoring Iran's monarchy that was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, already had been targeted in an apparent Iranian assassination plot on U.S. soil in 2009.          \"We're seeking support from any democratic country, any free country,\" his son Shayan Sharmahd told the AP. \"It is a violation of human rights. You can't just pick someone up in a third country and drag them into your country.\"          Iran's Intelligence Ministry has not elaborated on how it detained the elder Sharmahd, other than to deny he was arrested in Tajikistan. The ministry and Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.          Sharmahd had been in Dubai, trying to travel to India for a business deal involving his software company, his son said. He was hoping to get a connecting flight despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic disrupting global travel.          Sharmahd's family received the last message from him on July 28. After that, he no longer responded to their calls and messages, his son said. Telephone location data showed his mobile phone that day at the Premier Inn Dubai International Airport Hotel, where he had been staying.          It's unclear how the abduction happened. A hotel operator said Sharmahd had checked out July 29. Tracking data showed Sharmahd's mobile phone traveled south from Dubai to the city of Al Ain on July 29, crossing the border into Oman and staying overnight near an Islamic school in the border city of al-Buraimi.          On July 30, tracking data showed the mobile phone traveled to the Omani port city of Sohar, where the signal stopped.          Two days later, on Saturday, Iran announced it had captured Sharmahd in a \"complex operation.\" The Intelligence Ministry published a photograph of him blindfolded.          His son said he believed that in the state TV footage, Sharmahd hurriedly read whatever Iran wanted him to say.          \"Imagine your own father being tied up one day on television and you see that,\" Shayan Sharmahd said.          Western officials believe Iran runs intelligence operations in Dubai and keeps tabs on the hundreds of thousands of Iranians living in the city-state. Iran is suspected of kidnapping and later killing British-Iranian national Abbas Yazdi in Dubai in 2013, though Tehran has denied involvement.          It isn't just Iran that maintains a presence in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, home to some 5,000 U.S. troops and the U.S. Navy's busiest port of call outside of America. The U.S. State Department runs its Iran Regional Presence Office in Dubai, where diplomats monitor Iranian media reports and talk to Iranians.          Dubai's hotels long have been targeted by intelligence operatives, such as in the suspected 2010 assassination by the Israeli Mossad of Hamas operative Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. Dubai and the rest of the UAE have since invested even more in an elaborate surveillance network.          Dubai police and officials, as well as federal officials in Abu Dhabi and the Omani Embassy in Washington, did not respond to requests for comment.          The UAE has long been trying to de-escalate tensions with Iran after President Trump's maximum pressure campaign saw him pull out of the nuclear deal. On Sunday, Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan held a videoconference with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.          However, over the last year, a series of escalating incidents have shaken the wider Mideast, leading to a U.S. drone strike in January that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad and an Iranian ballistic missile attack that injured dozens of American soldiers in Iraq. Also, there have been explosions on oil tankers off the Emirati coast that the U.S. Navy has blamed on Iranian limpet mines.          Last month, an oil tanker seized by the UAE after being suspected of smuggling Iranian crude oil was hijacked, likely by Iran. In June, Iran sentenced to death another opposition journalist living in Paris it detained under unclear circumstances.          For now, Sharmahd's family said they contacted the government in Germany, where he holds citizenship, and the U.S. government as he's lived for years in America and was on track for citizenship after the 2009 assassination plot.          The German Embassy in Tehran has asked Iranian authorities for consular access, according to the Foreign Ministry in Berlin, hoping to understand how Sharmahd was arrested. However, Iran doesn't allow consular access for its dual nationals, considering them exclusively Iranian citizens.          The State Department, which mistakenly referred to Sharmahd in an earlier report as an American citizen, acknowledged his arrest and said Iran \"has a long history of detaining Iranians and foreign nationals on spurious charges.\"          While Iran has yet to say what charges Sharmahd faces, others detained over the 2008 bombing have been convicted and executed. Sharmahd's son said his father suffers from Parkinson's disease, as well as diabetes and heart trouble that require medication and careful monitoring.          \"He's very much at risk,\" his son said. \"All of us are extremely concerned.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trump calls for new Iran deal</td>\n",
       "      <td>With the Middle East on high alert after an attack on Saudi oil facilities, world leaders were jockeying at the United Nations on Monday to respond to the attack and find a resolution to heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran.          President Donald Trump said he was ready for a new agreement with Iran, a year and a half after he withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal and stringently reimposed sanctions on Tehran. But Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, who arrived in New York on Monday for the U.N. General Assembly, has said there will be no negotiations until Trump eases or lifts sanctions, which the U.S. agreed to do under the original deal.          When asked by medianame News on Monday whether Rouhani would meet Trump, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded emphatically, \"No!\"          After expressing an openness to meeting Rouhani last month, Trump seemed to admit it's no longer likely.          \"We have a long way to go. We'll have to see what happens. We're doing just fine,\" he told reporters as he entered the U.N.          Hours later, during a photo op with Singapore's prime minister, Trump talked up his tough sanctions.          \"We have a lot of pressure on them right now -- more pressure than they've ever had. ... A lot of things are happening with respect to Iran. A lot more than you would know. A lot more than the media knows, OK? I’ll be discussing it a little bit tomorrow,\" he said, one day before his address to the U.N. General Assembly.          Still, while the U.S. and Iranian delegations are not likely to meet, other world leaders are trying to step in to resolve tensions between the two. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to Trump on Monday morning before his meeting with Rouhani on Monday evening, he told reporters -- with a Trump meeting possible for Tuesday.          The attack on Saudi Arabia's oil processing facilities, one of the largest in the world, seems to have changed the calculus for the European countries who remain signatories to the nuclear deal -- Germany, France and the United Kingdom -- and have tried to lower tensions between the U.S. and Iran. In a joint statement Monday, they said they had concluded, \"Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation.\"          But the diplomatic divide with the Trump administration over the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, remains.          The U.S. and Europe now agree on the need to begin negotiations with Iran on a new agreement. The joint European statement said, \"Time has come for Iran to accept negotiation on a long-term framework for its nuclear programme as well as on issues related to regional security, including its missiles programme and other means of deliver.\"          But how to get to those talks is the source of division. The Europeans have proposed an interim agreement where Iran returns to compliance with the nuclear deal in exchange for the U.S. permitting some economic aid to Iran, for example through a $15 billion line of credit. If the two sides agreed to that, a diplomatic source told medianame News, the hope is that they could begin negotiations on a new deal that extends the nuclear deal's limits on Iran and addresses its ballistic missile program.          When Macron first broached the subject with Trump during the G-7 summit in late August, Trump said he liked the idea and would consider it. But on Monday, he bristled at the idea of Macron mediating.          \"He's a friend of mine, but we're not looking for any mediators. They know who to call,\" he said of Iran's leaders.          His senior advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have also shot down the idea and made clear that they will do nothing to halt their \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran.          That campaign involves the tightest economic sanctions against Iran ever, with a push to halt all Iranian oil exports and the designation of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite wing of its military, as a foreign terrorist organization. In response to that pressure, Iran has spent the last few months lashing out in the Persian Gulf -- attacking commercial oil tankers, shooting down a U.S. drone, seizing a handful of ships and attacking one of the world's largest oil processing facilities in Saudi Arabia.          Iran denies responsibility for that attack, which took out more than half of Saudi oil production. But it has started to violate its commitments under the nuclear deal, with each step demanding that European powers step in and provide economic aid or else they'll violate another threshold.          During the General Assembly, the Trump administration intends to bring the focus on Iran after blaming it for the massive Saudi attack, according to a senior State Department official, but they added that the U.S. is really looking for the Saudis to take the lead and present evidence to the U.N. to rally international support for them after they suffered this attack.          \"Now it's up to the international community and really up to Saudi Arabia for what they're going to say this week, what they're going to present to the U.N. because it was the Saudis that were attacked and had almost 60% of their oil supply taken off the market,\" the official said.</td>\n",

Behzad Pourghannad was extradited from Germany to face charges in July. He was charged with violating U.S. sanctions by circumventing export controls on carbon fiber, according to U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman of the Southern District of New York. Pourghannad pled guilty to the charges in August. DAUGHTER OF EX-FBI AGENT MISSING FOR OVER A DECADE IN IRAN THANKS TRUMP FOR 'CLEAR MESSAGE' TO TEHRAN          Carbon fiber can be used to make nose cones for long-range missiles and can be used to manufacture rotors in the centrifuges that enrich uranium. Iran in recent months has made numerous announcements that it would be violating international agreement to use advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium and increase its nuclear stockpile. IRAN ENRICHING URANIUM AT 'NOT DECLARED' SITE, UN NUCLEAR WATCHDOG SAYS          A United Nations nuclear watchdog revealed Monday that Iran is making good on that promise. Uranium of a man-made origin was found at a site not declared to inspectors. According to the announcement, Pourghannad and his co-conspirators, Ali Reza Shokri and Farzin Faridmanesh, lived and worked in Iran between 2008 and 2013. During that time they worked together to obtain the carbon fiber from the United States and secretly export it to Iran through third countries. Shokri procured the carbon fiber, Pourghannad served as the financial guarantor of the transactions and Faridmanesh served as the shipper. In the 2013 transaction alone, Pourghannad and Shokri negotiated for the purchase and shipment of more than five tons of carbon fiber to Iran by way of the nation of Georgia. Faridmanesh labeled the carbon fiber “acrylic” to sneak by U.S. export controls. The DOJ did not specify how much of the carbon fiber actually made it to Iran, or what would become of co-defendants Faridmanesh and Shokri.\n",

The comments by government spokesman Ali Rabiei were the first explanation offered by Iran for Thursday’s explosion, which came ahead of a planned satellite launch by the Islamic Republic that the U.S. has criticized.          Rabiei also criticized President Donald Trump for tweeting what appeared to be a surveillance photo of the aftermath of the explosion shot by a U.S. spy satellite.          The explosion marked the third failure involving a rocket at the Iranian center, which has raised suspicions of sabotage in Iran’s space program.          However, Rabiei dismissed that, saying that “this has been a technical matter and a technical error. Our experts unanimously say so.”          “The explosion happened at the launchpad and no satellite had yet been transferred to the launchpad,” Rabiei said. “It happened at a test site, not at the launch site.”          Commercially available satellite images by Planet Labs Inc. and Maxar Technologies showed a black plume of smoke rising above a launch pad Thursday, with what appeared to be the charred remains of a rocket and its launch stand. In previous days, satellite images had shown officials there repainted the launch pad blue.          The photo released Friday by Trump appeared to be a once-classified surveillance photo from American intelligence agencies. Analysts said the black rectangle in the photo’s upper-left-hand corner likely covered up the photo’s classification.          The image showed damaged vehicles around the launch pad, as well as damage done to the rocket’s launcher. It also clearly showed a large phrase written in Farsi on the pad: “National Product, National Power.”          “The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran,” Trump wrote in his tweet, identifying the rocket used. “I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One.”          Rabiei criticized Trump’s decision to tweet about the rocket explosion.          “We don’t understand why the U.S president tweets and posts satellite pictures with excitement. This is not understandable,” he said. “Maybe this is because lack of Iran-related subjects that they raise such issues.”          The blast followed two failed satellite launches of the Payam and Doosti in January and February. A separate fire at the Imam Khomeini Space Center in February also killed three researchers, authorities said at the time.          Over the past decade, Iran has sent several short-lived satellites into orbit and in 2013 launched a monkey into space.          Iran is preparing to launch the Nahid-1, a communication satellite, into space.          The U.S. alleges such satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution calling on Iran to undertake no activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.          Iran, which long has said it does not seek nuclear weapons, maintains its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component. Tehran also says it hasn’t violated the U.N. resolution as it only “called upon” Tehran not to conduct such tests.          The tests have taken on new importance to the U.S. amid the maximalist approach to Iran taken by President Donald Trump’s administration. Tensions have been high between the countries since Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from Iran’s nuclear deal over a year ago and imposed sanctions, including on Iran’s oil industry. Iran recently has begun to break the accord itself while trying to push Europe to help it sell oil abroad.\n",

His decision not to respond with military force may end up saving American lives, but it’s Israel that could end up suffering the most. And with new U.S. sanctions against Iran, Christians can’t overlook the importance of U.S. support of Israel in the fragile upcoming months.          Geographically, it’s far easier for Iran to retaliate against Israel than it is to strike the U.S. itself. And Iran has a history of using terrorist proxies to commit violence throughout the Middle East. While Iran may have a great deal to lose from a conventional war with the U.S., it has a lot less to lose by continuing its pattern of proxy attacks.          The Shiite Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which receives $700 million a year in funds from Iran, is considered by many to be “the most powerful Iranian proxy in the Middle East.” Hezbollah will almost certainly attack Israel if the situation escalates. Iran, not surprisingly, has threatened attacks in Israel and Dubai. In 2016, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps labeled an Iranian missile with “Israel must be wiped off the earth” in Hebrew. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has frequently called Israel a “cancerous tumor” that should be destroyed.          Hezbollah is a sophisticated network. It provides education, healthcare, and other services to its Lebanese Shiite constituents. It has already managed to build tunnels up to 22 stories deep from Lebanon to Israel. Between December 2018 and January 2019 alone, Israel located six such tunnels. Some were even outfitted with electricity, communications, and lighting.          Iran also provides hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, weapons, and training to other terrorist groups that threaten Israel, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.          Thanks to shared values and common strategic interests, the U.S. has a long history of solidarity with Israel, the only genuine democracy in the Middle East and one of the most valuable U.S. allies. American support for Israel in this precarious time is also a statement in support of freedom of religion and open access to the holy sites of the world’s major faiths.          Moreover, Israel’s intelligence service partners with the U.S. in many covert operations and intelligence missions. Israel buys billions of dollars in weapons from the U.S., and its location within the Middle East provides a strategic site for new weapons testing. Trade between the U.S. and Israel is currently at over $30 billion.          In the midst of fears surrounding our own country’s safety, it is imperative that we not forget about the security of our allies. Christians should be ardent in demanding that Israel’s safety be a priority for our government.          Timothy Head is executive director for the Faith & Freedom Coalition.\n",
       "920                               California-based man abducted by Iran while in Dubai, his family says  Dubai, United Arab Emirates — A California-based member of an Iranian militant opposition group in exile was abducted by Iran while staying in Dubai, his family said Tuesday.          The suspected cross-border abduction of Jamshid Sharmahd appears corroborated by mobile phone location data, shared by his family with The Associated Press, that suggests he was taken to neighboring Oman before heading to Iran.          Iran hasn't said how it detained Sharmahd, though the announcement came against the backdrop of covert actions conducted by Iran amid heightened tensions with the U.S. over Tehran's collapsing nuclear deal with world powers.          Iran accuses Sharmahd, 65, of Glendora, California of planning a 2008 attack on a mosque that killed 14 people and wounded over 200 others, as well as plotting other assaults through the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing. It aired an interview of him on state television - footage that resembled many other suspected coerced confessions broadcast by the Iranian government in the last decade.          His family, however, insists Sharmahd only served as a spokesman for the group and had nothing to do with any attacks in Iran. Sharmahd, who supports restoring Iran's monarchy that was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, already had been targeted in an apparent Iranian assassination plot on U.S. soil in 2009.          \"We're seeking support from any democratic country, any free country,\" his son Shayan Sharmahd told the AP. \"It is a violation of human rights. You can't just pick someone up in a third country and drag them into your country.\"          Iran's Intelligence Ministry has not elaborated on how it detained the elder Sharmahd, other than to deny he was arrested in Tajikistan. The ministry and Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.          Sharmahd had been in Dubai, trying to travel to India for a business deal involving his software company, his son said. He was hoping to get a connecting flight despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic disrupting global travel.          Sharmahd's family received the last message from him on July 28. After that, he no longer responded to their calls and messages, his son said. Telephone location data showed his mobile phone that day at the Premier Inn Dubai International Airport Hotel, where he had been staying.          It's unclear how the abduction happened. A hotel operator said Sharmahd had checked out July 29. Tracking data showed Sharmahd's mobile phone traveled south from Dubai to the city of Al Ain on July 29, crossing the border into Oman and staying overnight near an Islamic school in the border city of al-Buraimi.          On July 30, tracking data showed the mobile phone traveled to the Omani port city of Sohar, where the signal stopped.          Two days later, on Saturday, Iran announced it had captured Sharmahd in a \"complex operation.\" The Intelligence Ministry published a photograph of him blindfolded.          His son said he believed that in the state TV footage, Sharmahd hurriedly read whatever Iran wanted him to say.          \"Imagine your own father being tied up one day on television and you see that,\" Shayan Sharmahd said.          Western officials believe Iran runs intelligence operations in Dubai and keeps tabs on the hundreds of thousands of Iranians living in the city-state. Iran is suspected of kidnapping and later killing British-Iranian national Abbas Yazdi in Dubai in 2013, though Tehran has denied involvement.          It isn't just Iran that maintains a presence in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, home to some 5,000 U.S. troops and the U.S. Navy's busiest port of call outside of America. The U.S. State Department runs its Iran Regional Presence Office in Dubai, where diplomats monitor Iranian media reports and talk to Iranians.          Dubai's hotels long have been targeted by intelligence operatives, such as in the suspected 2010 assassination by the Israeli Mossad of Hamas operative Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. Dubai and the rest of the UAE have since invested even more in an elaborate surveillance network.          Dubai police and officials, as well as federal officials in Abu Dhabi and the Omani Embassy in Washington, did not respond to requests for comment.          The UAE has long been trying to de-escalate tensions with Iran after President Trump's maximum pressure campaign saw him pull out of the nuclear deal. On Sunday, Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan held a videoconference with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.          However, over the last year, a series of escalating incidents have shaken the wider Mideast, leading to a U.S. drone strike in January that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad and an Iranian ballistic missile attack that injured dozens of American soldiers in Iraq. Also, there have been explosions on oil tankers off the Emirati coast that the U.S. Navy has blamed on Iranian limpet mines.          Last month, an oil tanker seized by the UAE after being suspected of smuggling Iranian crude oil was hijacked, likely by Iran. In June, Iran sentenced to death another opposition journalist living in Paris it detained under unclear circumstances.          For now, Sharmahd's family said they contacted the government in Germany, where he holds citizenship, and the U.S. government as he's lived for years in America and was on track for citizenship after the 2009 assassination plot.          The German Embassy in Tehran has asked Iranian authorities for consular access, according to the Foreign Ministry in Berlin, hoping to understand how Sharmahd was arrested. However, Iran doesn't allow consular access for its dual nationals, considering them exclusively Iranian citizens.          The State Department, which mistakenly referred to Sharmahd in an earlier report as an American citizen, acknowledged his arrest and said Iran \"has a long history of detaining Iranians and foreign nationals on spurious charges.\"          While Iran has yet to say what charges Sharmahd faces, others detained over the 2008 bombing have been convicted and executed. Sharmahd's son said his father suffers from Parkinson's disease, as well as diabetes and heart trouble that require medication and careful monitoring.          \"He's very much at risk,\" his son said. \"All of us are extremely concerned.\"\n",

President Donald Trump said he was ready for a new agreement with Iran, a year and a half after he withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal and stringently reimposed sanctions on Tehran. But Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, who arrived in New York on Monday for the U.N. General Assembly, has said there will be no negotiations until Trump eases or lifts sanctions, which the U.S. agreed to do under the original deal.          When asked by medianame News on Monday whether Rouhani would meet Trump, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded emphatically, \"No!\"          After expressing an openness to meeting Rouhani last month, Trump seemed to admit it's no longer likely.          \"We have a long way to go. We'll have to see what happens. We're doing just fine,\" he told reporters as he entered the U.N.          Hours later, during a photo op with Singapore's prime minister, Trump talked up his tough sanctions.          \"We have a lot of pressure on them right now -- more pressure than they've ever had. ... A lot of things are happening with respect to Iran. A lot more than you would know. A lot more than the media knows, OK? I’ll be discussing it a little bit tomorrow,\" he said, one day before his address to the U.N. General Assembly.          Still, while the U.S. and Iranian delegations are not likely to meet, other world leaders are trying to step in to resolve tensions between the two. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to Trump on Monday morning before his meeting with Rouhani on Monday evening, he told reporters -- with a Trump meeting possible for Tuesday.          The attack on Saudi Arabia's oil processing facilities, one of the largest in the world, seems to have changed the calculus for the European countries who remain signatories to the nuclear deal -- Germany, France and the United Kingdom -- and have tried to lower tensions between the U.S. and Iran. In a joint statement Monday, they said they had concluded, \"Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation.\"          But the diplomatic divide with the Trump administration over the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, remains.          The U.S. and Europe now agree on the need to begin negotiations with Iran on a new agreement. The joint European statement said, \"Time has come for Iran to accept negotiation on a long-term framework for its nuclear programme as well as on issues related to regional security, including its missiles programme and other means of deliver.\"          But how to get to those talks is the source of division. The Europeans have proposed an interim agreement where Iran returns to compliance with the nuclear deal in exchange for the U.S. permitting some economic aid to Iran, for example through a $15 billion line of credit. If the two sides agreed to that, a diplomatic source told medianame News, the hope is that they could begin negotiations on a new deal that extends the nuclear deal's limits on Iran and addresses its ballistic missile program.          When Macron first broached the subject with Trump during the G-7 summit in late August, Trump said he liked the idea and would consider it. But on Monday, he bristled at the idea of Macron mediating.          \"He's a friend of mine, but we're not looking for any mediators. They know who to call,\" he said of Iran's leaders.          His senior advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have also shot down the idea and made clear that they will do nothing to halt their \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran.          That campaign involves the tightest economic sanctions against Iran ever, with a push to halt all Iranian oil exports and the designation of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite wing of its military, as a foreign terrorist organization. In response to that pressure, Iran has spent the last few months lashing out in the Persian Gulf -- attacking commercial oil tankers, shooting down a U.S. drone, seizing a handful of ships and attacking one of the world's largest oil processing facilities in Saudi Arabia.          Iran denies responsibility for that attack, which took out more than half of Saudi oil production. But it has started to violate its commitments under the nuclear deal, with each step demanding that European powers step in and provide economic aid or else they'll violate another threshold.          During the General Assembly, the Trump administration intends to bring the focus on Iran after blaming it for the massive Saudi attack, according to a senior State Department official, but they added that the U.S. is really looking for the Saudis to take the lead and present evidence to the U.N. to rally international support for them after they suffered this attack.          \"Now it's up to the international community and really up to Saudi Arabia for what they're going to say this week, what they're going to present to the U.N. because it was the Saudis that were attacked and had almost 60% of their oil supply taken off the market,\" the official said."

       "      <td>Iran-Backed Milin Withdraw From U.S. Embassy in Baghdad</td>\n",
       "      <td>(BAGHDAD) — Iran-backed militiamen withdrew from the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Wednesday after two days of clashes with American security forces, but U.S.-Iran tensions remain high and could spill over into further violence.          The withdrawal followed calls from the government and senior militia leaders. It ended a two-day crisis marked by the breach of the largest and one of the most heavily fortified U.S. diplomatic missions in the world.          The attack and its volatile aftermath prompted the Pentagon to send hundreds of additional troops to the Middle East and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to delay a European and Central Asian trip.          In an orchestrated assault, hundreds of militiamen and their supporters broke into the embassy compound, destroying a reception area, smashing windows and spraying graffiti on walls to protest U.S. airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia over the weekend that killed 25 fighters.          The U.S. blamed the militia for a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base in the northern city of Kirkuk last week that killed a U.S. contractor.          The protesters set up a tent camp overnight and on Wednesday set fire to the reception area and hurled stones at U.S. Marines guarding the compound, who responded with tear gas. There were no injuries on either side and no American staff were evacuated from the compound.          The Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of state-allied militias — many backed by Iran — called on its supporters to withdraw in response to an appeal by the Iraqi government, saying “your message has been received.”          By late afternoon the tents had been taken down and the protesters relocated to the opposite side of the Tigris River, outside the so-called Green Zone housing government offices and foreign embassies. U.S. Apache helicopters circled overhead.          “After achieving the intended aim, we pulled out from this place triumphantly,” said Fadhil al-Gezzi, a militia supporter. “We rubbed America’s nose in the dirt.” Trump has vowed to exact a “big price” for an attack he blamed squarely on Iran.          Kataeb Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia targeted by the U.S. airstrikes, initially refused to leave but later bowed to demands to disperse. The militia is separate from the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, though both are backed by Iran.          “We don’t care about these planes that are flying over the heads of the picketers. Neither do we care about the news that America will bring Marines,” said Mohammed Mohy, a spokesman for Kataeb Hezbollah. “On the contrary, this shows a psychological defeat and a big mental breakdown that the American administration is suffering from,” he said, before withdrawing from the area.          The violence came as Iran and its allies across the region have faced unprecedented mass protests in recent months and heavy U.S. sanctions have cratered Iran’s economy.          Iraq has been gripped by anti-government protests since October fueled by anger at widespread corruption and economic mismanagement, as well as Iran’s heavy influence over the country’s affairs. Those protesters were not involved in the embassy attack.          The Pentagon sent an infantry battalion of about 750 soldiers to the Middle East. A U.S. official familiar with the decision said they would go to Kuwait. Pompeo postponed a trip that was scheduled to start in Ukraine late Thursday so that he can monitor developments in Iraq and “ensure the safety and security of Americans in the Middle East,” said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus.          Iran denied involvement in the attack on the embassy. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted by media as saying that “if the Islamic Republic makes a decision to confront any country, it will do it directly.”          Iran later summoned the Swiss charge d’affaires, who represents American interests in Tehran, to protest what it said was war-mongering by U.S. officials.          Public consular operations at the embassy were suspended and future appointments cancelled, it said in a statement.          Tensions have steadily risen since Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and embarked on a campaign of maximum pressure through economic sanctions. Iran has responded by abandoning some of its commitments under the deal.          U.S. officials have blamed Iran for the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in September that caused a spike in world oil prices. But the Trump administration has not responded with direct military action, apparently fearing a wider conflict.          The U.S. has sent more than 14,000 additional troops to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression. At the time of the attack, the U.S. had about 5,200 troops in Iraq, mainly to train Iraqi forces and help them combat Islamic State extremists.          The U.S. and Iran have vied for influence over Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Iran has close ties to Iraq’s Shiite majority and major political factions, and its influence has steadily grown since then.          Iran helped to mobilize tens of thousands of mostly Shiite militiamen to battle the Islamic State group when it stormed across northern and western Iraq in 2014 as the armed forces collapsed. The U.S. and Iran both provided vital aid to Iraqi forces, who eventually declared victory over the extremists in December 2017.          The political influence of the Popular Mobilization Forces has risen in recent years, and their allies dominate the parliament and the government. That has made them the target of the anti-government protesters, who have attacked Iranian diplomatic missions and the local headquarters of parties affiliated with the militias across southern Iraq.          They have also set up a sprawling protest camp in central Baghdad, and for weeks have been trying to enter the Green Zone. Iraqi security forces have beaten them back with tear gas and live ammunition, killing hundreds.          The militiamen and their supporters, however, were able to quickly enter the Green Zone and mass in front of the embassy, with little if any resistance from authorities.          Iraq’s government vehemently condemned the airstrikes on the militia, saying it violated national sovereignty. But Iran and its allies might have also seen the attack as a way of diverting attention from the anti-government protests.          “Iran has been trying to provoke the U.S. into helping it solve its Iraq problem,” said the Crisis Group, an international think tank. “The Trump administration, by responding to the attacks in Kirkuk and elsewhere with airstrikes, has obliged.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>American military forces arrived on scene at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, on Tuesday to stop a terrorist attack against the embassy that was being carried out by thousands of attackers.          President Donald Trump announced that Iran would be held “fully responsible” for any lives lost or damage to the facility and that they would pay “a very big price.”          “The U.S. Embassy in Iraq is, &amp; has been for hours, SAFE! Many of our great Warfighters, together with the most lethal military equipment in the world, was immediately rushed to the site,” Trump tweeted. “Thank you to the President &amp; Prime Minister of Iraq for their rapid response upon request Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!”          Dan Scavino Jr, Assistant to President Trump, tweeted out a video of the Marines loading up their weapons and deploying to the embassy.          Myles B. Caggins III, official military Spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), tweeted out a video of AH-64 Apache helicopters arriving at the embassy to provide backup support.          Democrats and far-left media pundits politicized the terrorist attack to attack Trump and suggest that the attack was Trump’s Benghazi, however, critics quickly fired back at the claims.          Democrat Senator Chris Murphy (CT) tweeted: “The attack on our embassy in Baghdad is horrifying but predictable. Trump has rendered America impotent in the Middle East. No one fears us, no one listens to us. America has been reduced to huddling in safe rooms, hoping the bad guys will go away. What a disgrace.”          Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) responded: “Because ISIS &amp; others feared the US under Pres Obama right? The victims in Benghazi btw never safely made it out of a safe room &amp; the bad guys did get away. The amt of Dems spending New Years Eve rooting &amp; working against America just bc of hate for POTUS is the disgrace!”          Radio host Dale Jackson noted: “Reading these comments about the situation in #Iraq and it is clear that the media and their Democrats wanted a straight up Benghazi disaster. Odd, considering they claimed what happened at Benghazi was no big deal. This is who they are, they are telling you, believe them.”          This is a developing news story, refresh the page for updates.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A proxy war between the US and Iran just moved a step closer</td>\n",
       "      <td>(medianame) For the Iraqi government, it's the stuff of nightmares: A proxy war between the United States and Iran in a country already wracked by protests, crippled by political paralysis and threatened by renewed terrorism. But that war has come a step nearer with Sunday's US airstrikes against a pro-Iranian militia in Iraq .          The target of the US airstrikes is a group called Kataib Hezbollah, one of the most radical Shia militia in Iraq, with close links to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. US officials hold it responsible for a growing number of rocket attacks against US facilities in Iraq. The death of a US contractor in one such attack last week was the last straw for the Trump administration.          On Monday, Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani, Iraq's pre-eminent Shia cleric, demanded action from the government \"so as not to make Iraq an arena for settling regional and international accounts.\" But that settling is now gathering pace.          Fighters from the Kataib Hezbollah militia, inspect damage in the aftermath of a US airstrike in Qaim, Iraq.          Kataib Hezbollah is militantly anti-American. In 2017 and 2018, its fighters in Syria tried to attack the US-supported garrison at al-Tanf on the Iraqi border. Earlier this month it boasted of the failure of the \"Saudi-American-Zionist axis of evil.\"          It has provided hundreds of fighters for the Assad regime in Syria -- part of a broader Iranian effort to help stamp out the insurgency there -- and is an important element in Iranian efforts to extend its influence through northern Iraq and into Syria. The US strikes, notably, were against targets along the main route between Iran and Syria.          In recent months, Kataib Hezbollah has stepped up attacks on US facilities in Iraq in line with Iran's wider campaign of resistance against the re-imposition of sanctions by the US. To start with, these attacks were no more than irritants -- most of the rockets fell harmlessly some distance from US forces. But the range and potency of the attacks has grown, and they've become more accurate. In one attack in November, 17 rockets were fired on a base south of Mosul.          For the Iraqi government, the face-off between the US and pro-Iranian militia adds another source of instability in a country already deep in crisis. Roiling popular protests since October have pitted young Iraqis fed up with corruption and the lack of opportunity against the security forces and militia like Kata'ib who are accused of some of the harshest actions against demonstrators. The US has already sanctioned a leading Kataib Hezbollah official for human rights abuses.At least 485 people have been killed since protests erupted and at least 27,000 people have been injured, according to the Independent High Commission for Human Rights of Iraq.          The unrest has further weakened an already fragile economy and has triggered a political meltdown. Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi has resigned but no consensus candidate has yet emerged to replace him. Two constitutional deadlines to nominate a successor have come and gone.          In many places, the protests have taken on an anti-Iranian flavour, with the Iranian consulate in the city of Najaf torched last month.          Iraqi President Barham Salih, a Kurd, last week threatened to quit \"to avoid more bloodshed and in order to safeguard civil peace\" rather than approve a candidate for Prime Minister seen as pro-Iranian. Thousands of protestors, who are demanding fresh elections and an end to the domination of existing political blocs, took to the streets in support of Salih's stand.          But Iran has invested heavily in deepening its influence in an arc from Iraq through Syria to Lebanon and will not give up its strategic gains without a fight, even as US sanctions make its expansionism difficult to afford.          The political deadlock in Baghdad is beginning to look like a struggle between pro-Iranian Shia groups and Iraqi nationalists. And the airstrikes will embolden the pro-Iranian blocs in parliament to push again for the expulsion of US forces from Iraq.          The last time they left, at the end of 2011, ISIS took full advantage. The remnants of the group may now be savoring a new opportunity. They have been regrouping underground in provinces north of Baghdad. There has been a steady uptick in ambushes, bomb attacks and assassinations claimed by the group in the latter half of this year.          A proxy war between US forces and pro-Iranian groups that are notionally tied into the Iraqi military would make counter-terrorism operations -- the very reason the US still has 5,000 troops in Iraq -- more difficult.          The rhetoric suggests the US airstrikes will not go unanswered. Iran has said the US \"must accept responsibility of the consequences of the illegal attacks.\" Kataib Hezbollah called for \"a new phase of pride and honor, a phase to drive the brutal American enemy out of our holy land.\"          In November the senior US military commander in the region, Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, said Iran was trying to \"crack the campaign\" of US sanctions through attacks designed to provoke an American military response. If that's the case, Tehran may have succeeded.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Most troops were either flown out of the base or sheltering in bunkers by 11:00 p.m. local time Tuesday -- shortly before the first of four volleys of missiles began at just after 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday, officers said during the first tour by journalists of the air base.          The attack lasted around two hours, only targeting the US areas of the air base, which comprise around a quarter of the Iraqi base.          Officers called it a \"miracle\" that there were no casualties at the blasted site, with missiles landing just a few meters from bunkers, and some essential personnel remaining outside throughout.          It is the first time troops at the base have spoken in detail of the moments before the attack, revealing that they were able to seek shelter in bunkers shortly before missiles struck.          US troops knew there was going to be an attack on their base -- they just didn't know what the nature of the attack would be. The ruined remains of the living quarters where soldiers were evacuated. The Iranian attack on the Al-Asad airbase was one of two on Iraqi military bases housing US troops on Wednesday. The attacks were in retaliation for a drone strike at a Baghdad airport that killed Iran's most powerful military commander, Qasem Soleimani, earlier in the week. President Donald Trump said Soleimani was plotting \"imminent and sinister attacks\" on Americans, though he has been unable to offer a time frame on when this would be. Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi previously said Iran sent Iraq an official verbal message that an attack \"had begun or would begin shortly,\" on unspecified US military locations. An Arab diplomatic source also told medianame that Iraq gave advance warning to the US on \"which bases would be hit\" after Iranian officials passed on the information. Lt. Col. Staci Colemsan said it was a \"miracle\" there were no casualties. The first strike hit at 1:34 a.m. and after a brief pause of around 15 minutes, the next volley began. Two more volleys of missiles followed over the next two hours. At dawn, officers finally emerged from bunkers to discover the full scale of destruction. The Al-Asad air base, which houses US troops, is one of the largest and oldest military bases in Iraq. It is located in Anbar province, a hotbed of ISIS activity in western Iraq between 2014 and 2017. Anbar was the birthplace of Sunni extremism in the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. In December 2018, Trump visited troops at Al-Asad. \"We came in, we felt very safe coming in. It was a pretty difficult journey in certain ways, but we felt very, very good, very safe,\" Trump said, according to a White House transcript. Vice President Mike Pence visited the base a year later to celebrate Thanksgiving with around 150 service members. The US military presence in Iraq has fluctuated greatly since the 2003 invasion. At its height, the US had 170,000 troops in Iraq. In 2011, former President Barack Obama withdrew US forces from the country. Around 5,000 troops were deployed to Iraq in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government, seeking US assistance in the fight against ISIS. Troop levels have been roughly the same since.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Opinion | Unity Through Autonomy in Iraq</td>\n",
       "      <td>Iraq's new government of national unity will not stop the deterioration. Iraqis have had three such governments in the last three years, each with Sunnis in key posts, without noticeable effect. The alternative path out of this terrible trap has five elements.          The first is to establish three largely autonomous regions with a viable central government in Baghdad. The Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws, administration and internal security. The central government would control border defense, foreign affairs and oil revenues. Baghdad would become a federal zone, while densely populated areas of mixed populations would receive both multisectarian and international police protection.          Decentralization is hardly as radical as it may seem: the Iraqi Constitution, in fact, already provides for a federal structure and a procedure for provinces to combine into regional governments.          Besides, things are already heading toward partition: increasingly, each community supports federalism, if only as a last resort. The Sunnis, who until recently believed they would retake power in Iraq, are beginning to recognize that they won't and don't want to live in a Shiite-controlled, highly centralized state with laws enforced by sectarian militias. The Shiites know they can dominate the government, but they can't defeat a Sunni insurrection. The Kurds will not give up their 15-year-old autonomy.          Some will say moving toward strong regionalism would ignite sectarian cleansing. But that's exactly what is going on already, in ever-bigger waves. Others will argue that it would lead to partition. But a breakup is already under way. As it was in Bosnia, a strong federal system is a viable means to prevent both perils in Iraq.          The second element would be to entice the Sunnis into joining the federal system with an offer they couldn't refuse. To begin with, running their own region should be far preferable to the alternatives: being dominated by Kurds and Shiites in a central government or being the main victims of a civil war. But they also have to be given money to make their oil-poor region viable. The Constitution must be amended to guarantee Sunni areas 20 percent (approximately their proportion of the population) of all revenues.          The third component would be to ensure the protection of the rights of women and ethno-religious minorities by increasing American aid to Iraq but tying it to respect for those rights. Such protections will be difficult, especially in the Shiite-controlled south, but Washington has to be clear that widespread violations will stop the cash flow.          Fourth, the president must direct the military to design a plan for withdrawing and redeploying our troops from Iraq by 2008 (while providing for a small but effective residual force to combat terrorists and keep the neighbors honest). We must avoid a precipitous withdrawal that would lead to a national meltdown , but we also can't have a substantial long-term American military presence. That would do terrible damage to our armed forces, break American and Iraqi public support for the mission and leave Iraqis without any incentive to shape up.          Fifth, under an international or United Nations umbrella, we should convene a regional conference to pledge respect for Iraq's borders and its federal system. For all that Iraq's neighbors might gain by picking at its pieces, each faces the greater danger of a regional war. A \"contact group\" of major powers would be set up to lean on neighbors to comply with the deal.          Mr. Bush has spent three years in a futile effort to establish a strong central government in Baghdad, leaving us without a real political settlement, with a deteriorating security situation — and with nothing but the most difficult policy choices. The five-point alternative plan offers a plausible path to that core political settlement among Iraqis, along with the economic, military and diplomatic levers to make the political solution work. It is also a plausible way for Democrats and Republicans alike to protect our basic security interests and honor our country's sacrifices.</td>\n",

       "172                                              Iran-Backed Milin Withdraw From U.S. Embassy in Baghdad  (BAGHDAD) — Iran-backed militiamen withdrew from the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Wednesday after two days of clashes with American security forces, but U.S.-Iran tensions remain high and could spill over into further violence.          The withdrawal followed calls from the government and senior militia leaders. It ended a two-day crisis marked by the breach of the largest and one of the most heavily fortified U.S. diplomatic missions in the world.          The attack and its volatile aftermath prompted the Pentagon to send hundreds of additional troops to the Middle East and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to delay a European and Central Asian trip.          In an orchestrated assault, hundreds of militiamen and their supporters broke into the embassy compound, destroying a reception area, smashing windows and spraying graffiti on walls to protest U.S. airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia over the weekend that killed 25 fighters.          The U.S. blamed the militia for a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base in the northern city of Kirkuk last week that killed a U.S. contractor.          The protesters set up a tent camp overnight and on Wednesday set fire to the reception area and hurled stones at U.S. Marines guarding the compound, who responded with tear gas. There were no injuries on either side and no American staff were evacuated from the compound.          The Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of state-allied militias — many backed by Iran — called on its supporters to withdraw in response to an appeal by the Iraqi government, saying “your message has been received.”          By late afternoon the tents had been taken down and the protesters relocated to the opposite side of the Tigris River, outside the so-called Green Zone housing government offices and foreign embassies. U.S. Apache helicopters circled overhead.          “After achieving the intended aim, we pulled out from this place triumphantly,” said Fadhil al-Gezzi, a militia supporter. “We rubbed America’s nose in the dirt.” Trump has vowed to exact a “big price” for an attack he blamed squarely on Iran.          Kataeb Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia targeted by the U.S. airstrikes, initially refused to leave but later bowed to demands to disperse. The militia is separate from the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, though both are backed by Iran.          “We don’t care about these planes that are flying over the heads of the picketers. Neither do we care about the news that America will bring Marines,” said Mohammed Mohy, a spokesman for Kataeb Hezbollah. “On the contrary, this shows a psychological defeat and a big mental breakdown that the American administration is suffering from,” he said, before withdrawing from the area.          The violence came as Iran and its allies across the region have faced unprecedented mass protests in recent months and heavy U.S. sanctions have cratered Iran’s economy.          Iraq has been gripped by anti-government protests since October fueled by anger at widespread corruption and economic mismanagement, as well as Iran’s heavy influence over the country’s affairs. Those protesters were not involved in the embassy attack.          The Pentagon sent an infantry battalion of about 750 soldiers to the Middle East. A U.S. official familiar with the decision said they would go to Kuwait. Pompeo postponed a trip that was scheduled to start in Ukraine late Thursday so that he can monitor developments in Iraq and “ensure the safety and security of Americans in the Middle East,” said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus.          Iran denied involvement in the attack on the embassy. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted by media as saying that “if the Islamic Republic makes a decision to confront any country, it will do it directly.”          Iran later summoned the Swiss charge d’affaires, who represents American interests in Tehran, to protest what it said was war-mongering by U.S. officials.          Public consular operations at the embassy were suspended and future appointments cancelled, it said in a statement.          Tensions have steadily risen since Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and embarked on a campaign of maximum pressure through economic sanctions. Iran has responded by abandoning some of its commitments under the deal.          U.S. officials have blamed Iran for the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in September that caused a spike in world oil prices. But the Trump administration has not responded with direct military action, apparently fearing a wider conflict.          The U.S. has sent more than 14,000 additional troops to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression. At the time of the attack, the U.S. had about 5,200 troops in Iraq, mainly to train Iraqi forces and help them combat Islamic State extremists.          The U.S. and Iran have vied for influence over Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Iran has close ties to Iraq’s Shiite majority and major political factions, and its influence has steadily grown since then.          Iran helped to mobilize tens of thousands of mostly Shiite militiamen to battle the Islamic State group when it stormed across northern and western Iraq in 2014 as the armed forces collapsed. The U.S. and Iran both provided vital aid to Iraqi forces, who eventually declared victory over the extremists in December 2017.          The political influence of the Popular Mobilization Forces has risen in recent years, and their allies dominate the parliament and the government. That has made them the target of the anti-government protesters, who have attacked Iranian diplomatic missions and the local headquarters of parties affiliated with the militias across southern Iraq.          They have also set up a sprawling protest camp in central Baghdad, and for weeks have been trying to enter the Green Zone. Iraqi security forces have beaten them back with tear gas and live ammunition, killing hundreds.          The militiamen and their supporters, however, were able to quickly enter the Green Zone and mass in front of the embassy, with little if any resistance from authorities.          Iraq’s government vehemently condemned the airstrikes on the militia, saying it violated national sovereignty. But Iran and its allies might have also seen the attack as a way of diverting attention from the anti-government protests.          “Iran has been trying to provoke the U.S. into helping it solve its Iraq problem,” said the Crisis Group, an international think tank. “The Trump administration, by responding to the attacks in Kirkuk and elsewhere with airstrikes, has obliged.”\n",

President Donald Trump announced that Iran would be held “fully responsible” for any lives lost or damage to the facility and that they would pay “a very big price.”          “The U.S. Embassy in Iraq is, & has been for hours, SAFE! Many of our great Warfighters, together with the most lethal military equipment in the world, was immediately rushed to the site,” Trump tweeted. “Thank you to the President & Prime Minister of Iraq for their rapid response upon request Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!”          Dan Scavino Jr, Assistant to President Trump, tweeted out a video of the Marines loading up their weapons and deploying to the embassy.          Myles B. Caggins III, official military Spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), tweeted out a video of AH-64 Apache helicopters arriving at the embassy to provide backup support.          Democrats and far-left media pundits politicized the terrorist attack to attack Trump and suggest that the attack was Trump’s Benghazi, however, critics quickly fired back at the claims.          Democrat Senator Chris Murphy (CT) tweeted: “The attack on our embassy in Baghdad is horrifying but predictable. Trump has rendered America impotent in the Middle East. No one fears us, no one listens to us. America has been reduced to huddling in safe rooms, hoping the bad guys will go away. What a disgrace.”          Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) responded: “Because ISIS & others feared the US under Pres Obama right? The victims in Benghazi btw never safely made it out of a safe room & the bad guys did get away. The amt of Dems spending New Years Eve rooting & working against America just bc of hate for POTUS is the disgrace!”          Radio host Dale Jackson noted: “Reading these comments about the situation in #Iraq and it is clear that the media and their Democrats wanted a straight up Benghazi disaster. Odd, considering they claimed what happened at Benghazi was no big deal. This is who they are, they are telling you, believe them.”          This is a developing news story, refresh the page for updates.\n",

But that war has come a step nearer with Sunday's US airstrikes against a pro-Iranian militia in Iraq .          The target of the US airstrikes is a group called Kataib Hezbollah, one of the most radical Shia militia in Iraq, with close links to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. US officials hold it responsible for a growing number of rocket attacks against US facilities in Iraq. The death of a US contractor in one such attack last week was the last straw for the Trump administration.          On Monday, Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani, Iraq's pre-eminent Shia cleric, demanded action from the government \"so as not to make Iraq an arena for settling regional and international accounts.\" But that settling is now gathering pace.          Fighters from the Kataib Hezbollah militia, inspect damage in the aftermath of a US airstrike in Qaim, Iraq.          Kataib Hezbollah is militantly anti-American. In 2017 and 2018, its fighters in Syria tried to attack the US-supported garrison at al-Tanf on the Iraqi border. Earlier this month it boasted of the failure of the \"Saudi-American-Zionist axis of evil.\"          It has provided hundreds of fighters for the Assad regime in Syria -- part of a broader Iranian effort to help stamp out the insurgency there -- and is an important element in Iranian efforts to extend its influence through northern Iraq and into Syria. The US strikes, notably, were against targets along the main route between Iran and Syria.          In recent months, Kataib Hezbollah has stepped up attacks on US facilities in Iraq in line with Iran's wider campaign of resistance against the re-imposition of sanctions by the US. To start with, these attacks were no more than irritants -- most of the rockets fell harmlessly some distance from US forces. But the range and potency of the attacks has grown, and they've become more accurate. In one attack in November, 17 rockets were fired on a base south of Mosul.          For the Iraqi government, the face-off between the US and pro-Iranian militia adds another source of instability in a country already deep in crisis. Roiling popular protests since October have pitted young Iraqis fed up with corruption and the lack of opportunity against the security forces and militia like Kata'ib who are accused of some of the harshest actions against demonstrators. The US has already sanctioned a leading Kataib Hezbollah official for human rights abuses.At least 485 people have been killed since protests erupted and at least 27,000 people have been injured, according to the Independent High Commission for Human Rights of Iraq.          The unrest has further weakened an already fragile economy and has triggered a political meltdown. Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi has resigned but no consensus candidate has yet emerged to replace him. Two constitutional deadlines to nominate a successor have come and gone.          In many places, the protests have taken on an anti-Iranian flavour, with the Iranian consulate in the city of Najaf torched last month.          Iraqi President Barham Salih, a Kurd, last week threatened to quit \"to avoid more bloodshed and in order to safeguard civil peace\" rather than approve a candidate for Prime Minister seen as pro-Iranian. Thousands of protestors, who are demanding fresh elections and an end to the domination of existing political blocs, took to the streets in support of Salih's stand.          But Iran has invested heavily in deepening its influence in an arc from Iraq through Syria to Lebanon and will not give up its strategic gains without a fight, even as US sanctions make its expansionism difficult to afford.          The political deadlock in Baghdad is beginning to look like a struggle between pro-Iranian Shia groups and Iraqi nationalists. And the airstrikes will embolden the pro-Iranian blocs in parliament to push again for the expulsion of US forces from Iraq.          The last time they left, at the end of 2011, ISIS took full advantage. The remnants of the group may now be savoring a new opportunity. They have been regrouping underground in provinces north of Baghdad. There has been a steady uptick in ambushes, bomb attacks and assassinations claimed by the group in the latter half of this year.          A proxy war between US forces and pro-Iranian groups that are notionally tied into the Iraqi military would make counter-terrorism operations -- the very reason the US still has 5,000 troops in Iraq -- more difficult.          The rhetoric suggests the US airstrikes will not go unanswered. Iran has said the US \"must accept responsibility of the consequences of the illegal attacks.\" Kataib Hezbollah called for \"a new phase of pride and honor, a phase to drive the brutal American enemy out of our holy land.\"          In November the senior US military commander in the region, Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, said Iran was trying to \"crack the campaign\" of US sanctions through attacks designed to provoke an American military response. If that's the case, Tehran may have succeeded.\n",

The attack lasted around two hours, only targeting the US areas of the air base, which comprise around a quarter of the Iraqi base.          Officers called it a \"miracle\" that there were no casualties at the blasted site, with missiles landing just a few meters from bunkers, and some essential personnel remaining outside throughout.          It is the first time troops at the base have spoken in detail of the moments before the attack, revealing that they were able to seek shelter in bunkers shortly before missiles struck.          US troops knew there was going to be an attack on their base -- they just didn't know what the nature of the attack would be. The ruined remains of the living quarters where soldiers were evacuated. The Iranian attack on the Al-Asad airbase was one of two on Iraqi military bases housing US troops on Wednesday. The attacks were in retaliation for a drone strike at a Baghdad airport that killed Iran's most powerful military commander, Qasem Soleimani, earlier in the week. President Donald Trump said Soleimani was plotting \"imminent and sinister attacks\" on Americans, though he has been unable to offer a time frame on when this would be. Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi previously said Iran sent Iraq an official verbal message that an attack \"had begun or would begin shortly,\" on unspecified US military locations. An Arab diplomatic source also told medianame that Iraq gave advance warning to the US on \"which bases would be hit\" after Iranian officials passed on the information. Lt. Col. Staci Colemsan said it was a \"miracle\" there were no casualties. The first strike hit at 1:34 a.m. and after a brief pause of around 15 minutes, the next volley began. Two more volleys of missiles followed over the next two hours. At dawn, officers finally emerged from bunkers to discover the full scale of destruction. The Al-Asad air base, which houses US troops, is one of the largest and oldest military bases in Iraq. It is located in Anbar province, a hotbed of ISIS activity in western Iraq between 2014 and 2017. Anbar was the birthplace of Sunni extremism in the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. In December 2018, Trump visited troops at Al-Asad. \"We came in, we felt very safe coming in. It was a pretty difficult journey in certain ways, but we felt very, very good, very safe,\" Trump said, according to a White House transcript. Vice President Mike Pence visited the base a year later to celebrate Thanksgiving with around 150 service members. The US military presence in Iraq has fluctuated greatly since the 2003 invasion. At its height, the US had 170,000 troops in Iraq. In 2011, former President Barack Obama withdrew US forces from the country. Around 5,000 troops were deployed to Iraq in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government, seeking US assistance in the fight against ISIS. Troop levels have been roughly the same since.\n",

Iraqis have had three such governments in the last three years, each with Sunnis in key posts, without noticeable effect. The alternative path out of this terrible trap has five elements.          The first is to establish three largely autonomous regions with a viable central government in Baghdad. The Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws, administration and internal security. The central government would control border defense, foreign affairs and oil revenues. Baghdad would become a federal zone, while densely populated areas of mixed populations would receive both multisectarian and international police protection.          Decentralization is hardly as radical as it may seem: the Iraqi Constitution, in fact, already provides for a federal structure and a procedure for provinces to combine into regional governments.          Besides, things are already heading toward partition: increasingly, each community supports federalism, if only as a last resort. The Sunnis, who until recently believed they would retake power in Iraq, are beginning to recognize that they won't and don't want to live in a Shiite-controlled, highly centralized state with laws enforced by sectarian militias. The Shiites know they can dominate the government, but they can't defeat a Sunni insurrection. The Kurds will not give up their 15-year-old autonomy.          Some will say moving toward strong regionalism would ignite sectarian cleansing. But that's exactly what is going on already, in ever-bigger waves. Others will argue that it would lead to partition. But a breakup is already under way. As it was in Bosnia, a strong federal system is a viable means to prevent both perils in Iraq.          The second element would be to entice the Sunnis into joining the federal system with an offer they couldn't refuse. To begin with, running their own region should be far preferable to the alternatives: being dominated by Kurds and Shiites in a central government or being the main victims of a civil war. But they also have to be given money to make their oil-poor region viable. The Constitution must be amended to guarantee Sunni areas 20 percent (approximately their proportion of the population) of all revenues.          The third component would be to ensure the protection of the rights of women and ethno-religious minorities by increasing American aid to Iraq but tying it to respect for those rights. Such protections will be difficult, especially in the Shiite-controlled south, but Washington has to be clear that widespread violations will stop the cash flow.          Fourth, the president must direct the military to design a plan for withdrawing and redeploying our troops from Iraq by 2008 (while providing for a small but effective residual force to combat terrorists and keep the neighbors honest). We must avoid a precipitous withdrawal that would lead to a national meltdown , but we also can't have a substantial long-term American military presence. That would do terrible damage to our armed forces, break American and Iraqi public support for the mission and leave Iraqis without any incentive to shape up.          Fifth, under an international or United Nations umbrella, we should convene a regional conference to pledge respect for Iraq's borders and its federal system. For all that Iraq's neighbors might gain by picking at its pieces, each faces the greater danger of a regional war. A \"contact group\" of major powers would be set up to lean on neighbors to comply with the deal.          Mr. Bush has spent three years in a futile effort to establish a strong central government in Baghdad, leaving us without a real political settlement, with a deteriorating security situation — and with nothing but the most difficult policy choices. The five-point alternative plan offers a plausible path to that core political settlement among Iraqis, along with the economic, military and diplomatic levers to make the political solution work. It is also a plausible way for Democrats and Republicans alike to protect our basic security interests and honor our country's sacrifices."

       "      <td>A poll released by Emerson College on Tuesday shows presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s lead over President Donald Trump has slipped to three points in the key battleground state of Minnesota.          The Emerson College poll of 733 likely registered voters in Minnesota was conducted between August 8 and 10, and has a margin of error of 3.6 percent, which means the contest between Biden and Trump in the state is currently a statistical tie.          The poll results continue the trend of momentum at both the national and battleground state level in the direction of President Trump, who has significantly narrowed the gap against Biden over the past three weeks.          President Trump narrowly lost Minnesota and its ten electoral college votes in the 2016 presidential election, garnering just 44,000 fewer votes than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.          Minnesota is ground zero of the Black Lives Matter inspired riots and protests that have swept the country since the death of George Floyd during his arrest by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department in May.          A new Emerson College Poll finds Minnesota is competitive again in 2020, with 50% of voters planning on supporting former VP Joe Biden and 47% intending to vote for President Trump. While the race is close, only 3% of voters remain undecided. Of voters who plan to vote by mail, 91% plan to vote for Biden, and of those who plan to vote in person, 68% plan to vote for Trump. President Trump’s approval rating amongst Minnesota voters is slightly underwater, with 46% approval, and 51% disapprove of his job performance, with 3% remaining neutral. Among independent voters, Trump’s approval is at 45% approval, and 47% disapproval. First-term Governor Tim Walz has a more favorable view, with 50% approving of his job performance, 41% disapproving and 9% holding a neutral opinion on the Governor.          The poll also found that incumbent Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) leads former Congressman Jason Lewis (R-MN), who won the Republican primary on Tuesday, by a similar three point margin, 48 percent to 45 percent, which is within the poll’s margin of error.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont holds a 12-point lead over his nearest 2020 Democratic presidential rival in New Hampshire, according to a WBUR poll released on Thursday.          Mr. Sanders was the top choice of 29% of likely Democratic primary voters, followed by Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, at 17%, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden at 14%, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 13%, according to the poll.          “I wouldn’t take these numbers to the bank,” said Steve Koczela, president of the MassINC Polling Group, which conducted the poll. “But you’ve got to be feeling pretty good about where you stand right at this moment if you’re the Sanders campaign.”          Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota was next at 6%, followed by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 5% apiece. No other candidate topped 2% support.          In a WBUR poll released in December, Mr. Buttigieg had been in the lead with 18% support, followed by Mr. Biden at 17%, Mr. Sanders at 15% and Ms. Warren at 12%.          Mr. Sanders cruised to victory in New Hampshire in 2016 over Hillary Clinton, the eventual Democratic presidential nominee who went on to lose to President Trump in the general election.          The survey of 426 likely primary voters was taken from Jan. 17-21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This article has been updated to include the latest information. We’re just 100 days out from learning if we’ll see four more years of the most unexpected, unorthodox and unpredictable presidency in American history, or the last-shot victory of a career politician who will beat by almost a decade Trump’s record of being the oldest man to ever take the office. According to most of the national and state pollsters — about whom Americans have justifiably developed a healthy skepticism — the 77-year-old “Sleepy Joe” is on cruise control to finally bag the biggest prize in the world after two previous failed attempts. Working against Trump is the compounding effect of the nation’s two simultaneous crises: COVID-19 and widespread racial unrest, or as The New York Times’ Nikole Hannah-Jones says she’d be “honored” to call them, the “1619 Riots.” But there are some slight glimmers of hope for Trump buried in some of the data. According to RealClearPolitics’ average of the national polls, Trump has never led Biden in a head-to-head. For most of 2020, through mid-March, the gap between the two has been around 5%. But as the pandemic lockdowns began, the divide roughly doubled, reaching its peak of 10.2% on June 23, by which point the George Floyd-sparked protests and riots were in full swing. The gap has slightly diminished since but remains formidable. The most recent average of the polls finds Trump trailing Biden by 8.7 points (49.6–40.9), roughly the same as last week (8.6) and about a point better than late June. Two of three polls updated since last week found the gap between the candidates shrinking. YouGov’s poll conducted July 19-21 found Biden ahead by 7, a two-point decline since the previous week. Rasmussen also tracked a slight closing of the gap from 3 to 2 points from a week before. The Hill found the opposite, Biden building on his lead by 3 points to +7 from its previous survey results. While, as usual, Rasmussen gives Trump the best shot at a repeat of 2016 — in which he trailed Hillary Clinton by 3.3%, ended up losing the popular vote by 2.1%, but went on to easily defeat her in the Electoral College — Quinnipiac’s widely reported poll from last week found Trump trailing by a dismal 15 points. Both polls appear to be outliers, however, with multiple polls finding the gap to be between 7 to 10 points. Here is the breakdown from some of the major national polls that factor into the average, with the most recent at the top:     • The Hill — Biden +7 (45–38) was Biden +4 last week          Will Biden’s lead erode as so often happens as the election approaches? The Trump-critical New York Times says it may not. “The last time a candidate sustained such a large advantage for so long was nearly 25 years ago, when Bill Clinton led Bob Dole in 1996,” the Times noted this week. While the national polls can be helpful in trying to gauge widespread public sentiment and momentum, the election, of course, isn’t decided by the popular vote — the data that matters the most comes from the states. The problem is, as 2016 demonstrated, state polling is often more inaccurate due to less thorough information. Despite losing the popular vote by about 2%, Trump ultimately trounced Clinton in several key swing states, allowing him to rack up 304 electoral votes to her 227. Heading into election day, the state polls indicated that he’d lose by 6 electoral votes. Currently, Trump’s outlook on the state level isn’t good. In order to shock the world again, he’ll need many of the state polls to be wrong again. Here’s the current breakdown of key battleground states, according to RCP’s averages:     • Arizona — Biden +2.8 (same as last month) — 2016: Trump won by 3.6     • Florida — Biden +7 (up from +3.4) — 2016: Trump won by 1.2     • Iowa — Trump +1.5 (down from +4.6) — 2016: Trump won by 9.4     • Michigan — Biden +8.2 (up from +4.2) — 2016: Trump won by 0.2     • North Carolina — Biden +2 (up from +0.8) — 2016: Trump won by 3.6     • Pennsylvania — Biden +6.7 (up from +4) — 2016: Trump won by 1.7     • Texas — Trump +0.2 (down from +2.2) — 2016: Trump won by 9     • Wisconsin — Biden +5.5 (up from +3.4) — 2016: Trump won by 0.7          If Biden were to hold on to the states Clinton won in 2016 and win the states above in which he currently leads by 3% or more (FL, MI, PA and WI), he would secure 71 votes more than Clinton (25, 16, 20, and 10, respectively). Those 71 votes would win the election for Biden with about 30 votes to spare. For those looking for hope for Trump, here’s a postmortem on how much the state pollsters botched the 2016 election. Below is how the Electoral College map is shaping up 14 weeks out:          The betting odds have been trending in the same direction as the polls since the lockdowns: Biden gaining at Trump’s expense. Action Network gives Biden a 59.7% chance of winning and Trump 33.2%. Here’s the bettors’ odds including some longshot candidates, among them Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson — and Clinton, of course:          This article has been updated and expanded to include additional recent and relevant information.

       "      <td>(medianame) Poll of the week: A new medianame/SSRS poll finds that former Vice President Joe Biden leads in the state of Florida by a 51% to 46% margin over President Donald Trump among registered voters.          The fact that the polls in Florida favor Biden should be one of the biggest warning signs yet for Trump's fledgling campaign. Yes, we still have 100 days to go, and history does suggest that the gap in Florida could close.          Still, Florida is probably the bellwether state that most meets the definition of \"must win\" for Trump if he wants to be elected to a second term, and he is losing there.          Moreover, it's a state that leans a little bit to the right of the nation. The last time the state voted more Democratic than the nation as a whole in a presidential election was 1976. The fact that Trump is down here by an average of 8 points in high quality live interview polls since June 1 suggests he is down significantly nationally.          Biden, on the other hand, has a clear path to 270 electoral votes without Florida. Biden has held 6 to 12 point leads in polls released this week from Michigan and Pennsylvania. This includes 6 point and 12 point advantages in Michigan from CBS News/YouGov and medianame/SSRS polls respectively released on Sunday. High quality polls from June gave Biden an average 10-point lead in Wisconsin . If Biden adds all of those states to his column plus the 232 electoral votes from the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, he gets to 278 electoral votes.          Winning Florida gives Biden a lot of backup options given that it's worth 29 electoral votes. If Biden adds the 29 electoral votes from Florida to the states Clinton took in 2016, he gets 261 electoral votes. Biden would need just 9 electoral votes more to get an electoral college majority. He could add any other state that Trump won in 2016 by 9.0 points or less.          As I noted a few months ago , Florida is geographically and demographically diverse from the Great Lake battleground states. If Biden stumbles in the mostly White Great Lake swing states, he could conceivably hold onto Florida and add on the diverse swing state of Arizona. Biden has consistently been ahead in Arizona, and he was up 4 and 5 points in the latest medianame/SSRS and NBC News/Marist College polls out Sunday.          Additionally, Biden could just win one of those Great Lake battleground states and Florida to get to 270 electoral votes. Biden could, for example, add Michigan (16 electoral votes) to his column, and it would be enough. Biden has held the advantage in every single nonpartisan poll in Michigan since early March          every Perhaps as importantly for Democrats, the polling in Florida has generally been accurate at the end of the campaign. There hasn't been an error like there was in the Great Lakes in 2016. The final Florida polls from medianame have been within 3 points of the outcome in presidential election since 2008. The same holds true for the gubernatorial and Senate elections in 2018          With Biden's polling lead being as wide as it is right now in the Sunshine State, the past accuracy of the final polls suggest he really is ahead right now.          The good news for Trump is that history does indicate how difficult it would be for Biden to win the state by a large margin. The last time a Democrat won the state by more than 6 points was 1948 . No candidate from either party has won the state by more than 6 points since 1992.          Overall the point is that we shouldn't be surprised if the margin in Florida closes down the stretch. That's exactly what happened in the 2018 midterms, when Republican candidates for governor and Senate squeaked out wins by less than a point.          As I've said many times before, Trump likely can't win if he doesn't turn around his low approval ratings on the coronavirus. His approval rating in Florida on the issue is just 42% among registered voters in the latest medianame poll.</td>\n",

The Emerson College poll of 733 likely registered voters in Minnesota was conducted between August 8 and 10, and has a margin of error of 3.6 percent, which means the contest between Biden and Trump in the state is currently a statistical tie.          The poll results continue the trend of momentum at both the national and battleground state level in the direction of President Trump, who has significantly narrowed the gap against Biden over the past three weeks.          President Trump narrowly lost Minnesota and its ten electoral college votes in the 2016 presidential election, garnering just 44,000 fewer votes than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.          Minnesota is ground zero of the Black Lives Matter inspired riots and protests that have swept the country since the death of George Floyd during his arrest by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department in May.          A new Emerson College Poll finds Minnesota is competitive again in 2020, with 50% of voters planning on supporting former VP Joe Biden and 47% intending to vote for President Trump. While the race is close, only 3% of voters remain undecided. Of voters who plan to vote by mail, 91% plan to vote for Biden, and of those who plan to vote in person, 68% plan to vote for Trump. President Trump’s approval rating amongst Minnesota voters is slightly underwater, with 46% approval, and 51% disapprove of his job performance, with 3% remaining neutral. Among independent voters, Trump’s approval is at 45% approval, and 47% disapproval. First-term Governor Tim Walz has a more favorable view, with 50% approving of his job performance, 41% disapproving and 9% holding a neutral opinion on the Governor.          The poll also found that incumbent Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) leads former Congressman Jason Lewis (R-MN), who won the Republican primary on Tuesday, by a similar three point margin, 48 percent to 45 percent, which is within the poll’s margin of error.\n",

Bernard Sanders of Vermont holds a 12-point lead over his nearest 2020 Democratic presidential rival in New Hampshire, according to a WBUR poll released on Thursday.          Mr. Sanders was the top choice of 29% of likely Democratic primary voters, followed by Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, at 17%, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden at 14%, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 13%, according to the poll.          “I wouldn’t take these numbers to the bank,” said Steve Koczela, president of the MassINC Polling Group, which conducted the poll. “But you’ve got to be feeling pretty good about where you stand right at this moment if you’re the Sanders campaign.”          Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota was next at 6%, followed by Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 5% apiece. No other candidate topped 2% support.          In a WBUR poll released in December, Mr. Buttigieg had been in the lead with 18% support, followed by Mr. Biden at 17%, Mr. Sanders at 15% and Ms. Warren at 12%.          Mr. Sanders cruised to victory in New Hampshire in 2016 over Hillary Clinton, the eventual Democratic presidential nominee who went on to lose to President Trump in the general election.          The survey of 426 likely primary voters was taken from Jan. 17-21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.\n",
       "311                                                Trump Vs. Biden: All The Latest Polls  This article has been updated to include the latest information. We’re just 100 days out from learning if we’ll see four more years of the most unexpected, unorthodox and unpredictable presidency in American history, or the last-shot victory of a career politician who will beat by almost a decade Trump’s record of being the oldest man to ever take the office. According to most of the national and state pollsters — about whom Americans have justifiably developed a healthy skepticism — the 77-year-old “Sleepy Joe” is on cruise control to finally bag the biggest prize in the world after two previous failed attempts. Working against Trump is the compounding effect of the nation’s two simultaneous crises: COVID-19 and widespread racial unrest, or as The New York Times’ Nikole Hannah-Jones says she’d be “honored” to call them, the “1619 Riots.” But there are some slight glimmers of hope for Trump buried in some of the data. According to RealClearPolitics’ average of the national polls, Trump has never led Biden in a head-to-head. For most of 2020, through mid-March, the gap between the two has been around 5%. But as the pandemic lockdowns began, the divide roughly doubled, reaching its peak of 10.2% on June 23, by which point the George Floyd-sparked protests and riots were in full swing. The gap has slightly diminished since but remains formidable. The most recent average of the polls finds Trump trailing Biden by 8.7 points (49.6–40.9), roughly the same as last week (8.6) and about a point better than late June. Two of three polls updated since last week found the gap between the candidates shrinking. YouGov’s poll conducted July 19-21 found Biden ahead by 7, a two-point decline since the previous week. Rasmussen also tracked a slight closing of the gap from 3 to 2 points from a week before. The Hill found the opposite, Biden building on his lead by 3 points to +7 from its previous survey results. While, as usual, Rasmussen gives Trump the best shot at a repeat of 2016 — in which he trailed Hillary Clinton by 3.3%, ended up losing the popular vote by 2.1%, but went on to easily defeat her in the Electoral College — Quinnipiac’s widely reported poll from last week found Trump trailing by a dismal 15 points. Both polls appear to be outliers, however, with multiple polls finding the gap to be between 7 to 10 points. Here is the breakdown from some of the major national polls that factor into the average, with the most recent at the top:     • The Hill — Biden +7 (45–38) was Biden +4 last week          Will Biden’s lead erode as so often happens as the election approaches? The Trump-critical New York Times says it may not. “The last time a candidate sustained such a large advantage for so long was nearly 25 years ago, when Bill Clinton led Bob Dole in 1996,” the Times noted this week. While the national polls can be helpful in trying to gauge widespread public sentiment and momentum, the election, of course, isn’t decided by the popular vote — the data that matters the most comes from the states. The problem is, as 2016 demonstrated, state polling is often more inaccurate due to less thorough information. Despite losing the popular vote by about 2%, Trump ultimately trounced Clinton in several key swing states, allowing him to rack up 304 electoral votes to her 227. Heading into election day, the state polls indicated that he’d lose by 6 electoral votes. Currently, Trump’s outlook on the state level isn’t good. In order to shock the world again, he’ll need many of the state polls to be wrong again. Here’s the current breakdown of key battleground states, according to RCP’s averages:     • Arizona — Biden +2.8 (same as last month) — 2016: Trump won by 3.6     • Florida — Biden +7 (up from +3.4) — 2016: Trump won by 1.2     • Iowa — Trump +1.5 (down from +4.6) — 2016: Trump won by 9.4     • Michigan — Biden +8.2 (up from +4.2) — 2016: Trump won by 0.2     • North Carolina — Biden +2 (up from +0.8) — 2016: Trump won by 3.6     • Pennsylvania — Biden +6.7 (up from +4) — 2016: Trump won by 1.7     • Texas — Trump +0.2 (down from +2.2) — 2016: Trump won by 9     • Wisconsin — Biden +5.5 (up from +3.4) — 2016: Trump won by 0.7          If Biden were to hold on to the states Clinton won in 2016 and win the states above in which he currently leads by 3% or more (FL, MI, PA and WI), he would secure 71 votes more than Clinton (25, 16, 20, and 10, respectively). Those 71 votes would win the election for Biden with about 30 votes to spare. For those looking for hope for Trump, here’s a postmortem on how much the state pollsters botched the 2016 election. Below is how the Electoral College map is shaping up 14 weeks out:          The betting odds have been trending in the same direction as the polls since the lockdowns: Biden gaining at Trump’s expense. Action Network gives Biden a 59.7% chance of winning and Trump 33.2%. Here’s the bettors’ odds including some longshot candidates, among them Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson — and Clinton, of course:          This article has been updated and expanded to include additional recent and relevant information.

The fact that the polls in Florida favor Biden should be one of the biggest warning signs yet for Trump's fledgling campaign. Yes, we still have 100 days to go, and history does suggest that the gap in Florida could close.          Still, Florida is probably the bellwether state that most meets the definition of \"must win\" for Trump if he wants to be elected to a second term, and he is losing there.          Moreover, it's a state that leans a little bit to the right of the nation. The last time the state voted more Democratic than the nation as a whole in a presidential election was 1976. The fact that Trump is down here by an average of 8 points in high quality live interview polls since June 1 suggests he is down significantly nationally.          Biden, on the other hand, has a clear path to 270 electoral votes without Florida. Biden has held 6 to 12 point leads in polls released this week from Michigan and Pennsylvania. This includes 6 point and 12 point advantages in Michigan from CBS News/YouGov and medianame/SSRS polls respectively released on Sunday. High quality polls from June gave Biden an average 10-point lead in Wisconsin . If Biden adds all of those states to his column plus the 232 electoral votes from the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, he gets to 278 electoral votes.          Winning Florida gives Biden a lot of backup options given that it's worth 29 electoral votes. If Biden adds the 29 electoral votes from Florida to the states Clinton took in 2016, he gets 261 electoral votes. Biden would need just 9 electoral votes more to get an electoral college majority. He could add any other state that Trump won in 2016 by 9.0 points or less.          As I noted a few months ago , Florida is geographically and demographically diverse from the Great Lake battleground states. If Biden stumbles in the mostly White Great Lake swing states, he could conceivably hold onto Florida and add on the diverse swing state of Arizona. Biden has consistently been ahead in Arizona, and he was up 4 and 5 points in the latest medianame/SSRS and NBC News/Marist College polls out Sunday.          Additionally, Biden could just win one of those Great Lake battleground states and Florida to get to 270 electoral votes. Biden could, for example, add Michigan (16 electoral votes) to his column, and it would be enough. Biden has held the advantage in every single nonpartisan poll in Michigan since early March          every Perhaps as importantly for Democrats, the polling in Florida has generally been accurate at the end of the campaign. There hasn't been an error like there was in the Great Lakes in 2016. The final Florida polls from medianame have been within 3 points of the outcome in presidential election since 2008. The same holds true for the gubernatorial and Senate elections in 2018          With Biden's polling lead being as wide as it is right now in the Sunshine State, the past accuracy of the final polls suggest he really is ahead right now.          The good news for Trump is that history does indicate how difficult it would be for Biden to win the state by a large margin. The last time a Democrat won the state by more than 6 points was 1948 . No candidate from either party has won the state by more than 6 points since 1992.          Overall the point is that we shouldn't be surprised if the margin in Florida closes down the stretch. That's exactly what happened in the 2018 midterms, when Republican candidates for governor and Senate squeaked out wins by less than a point.          As I've said many times before, Trump likely can't win if he doesn't turn around his low approval ratings on the coronavirus. His approval rating in Florida on the issue is just 42% among registered voters in the latest medianame poll.\n",

The latest Fox News poll, however, showed the two candidates tied at 42% each. * In a clear indication that the Biden campaign is trying to expand its appeal to Bernie Sanders' supporters, the former vice president added progressive ideas to his platform yesterday, announcing proposals to lower the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 60, while also endorsing student-debt forgiveness for many low- and middle-income families. * For his part, Sanders told medianame's Chris Hayes last night that he believes the former vice president recognizes the need to build support among the senator's backers. The Vermonter described Biden's new proposals as steps in the \"right direction.\" * In New Hampshire yesterday, a state judge rejected a Republican-backed law that made it more difficult for students to register to vote, calling the policy \"unconstitutional,\" \"discriminatory\" and \"unreasonable.\" * Speaking of the Granite State, Gov. Chris Sununu (R), traditionally a skeptic of widespread absentee voting, announced yesterday that New Hampshire voters will be able to vote by mail in the general election if the coronavirus is still putting the public at risk in the fall. * Nebraska is moving forward with its plans to hold primary elections on May 12, but Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) yesterday encouraged the state's voters to cast ballots via the mail. * And in Georgia, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported yesterday that about 60,000 voters in the state \"recently received absentee ballot request forms with the wrong return mailing or email address.\" The report added that state election officials said absentee ballot requests \"will be delivered to their correct destinations, even if voters send them to the erroneous pre-printed addresses.\""

       "      <td>Opinion | Why the Democratic Establishment Still Has Juice</td>\n",
       "      <td>One reason it was so widely assumed Sanders would take a significant delegate lead on Super Tuesday was that we had a direct analogue — Republicans nominated Donald Trump in 2016 when he jumped out to a lead by winning plurality victories against a fractured field. If Republicans couldn’t unite to blunt Trump, why would Democrats fare any better against Sanders?          That the Democrats managed it speaks to the different mood and dynamic of the party compared with the GOP in 2016.          Four years ago, Republicans loathed their party establishment and had turned their backs on their immediate past president, George W. Bush, who left office saddled with an unpopular war and a devastating financial crisis. Sanders wants to foment a revolution against the Democratic establishment. This resonates with his supporters but isn’t a widespread sentiment within the party.          As Peter Beinart points out in The Atlantic, Bush and his signature initiative, the Iraq War, weren’t popular with Republicans, whereas Barack Obama and his signature initiative, Obamacare, are popular with Democrats.          This made it possible for Biden to run on restoration rather than revolution and find an audience, especially in South Carolina, where many voters told exit pollsters they wanted a return to Obama policies.          It also meant that, as a general matter, pillars of the party establishment hadn’t been discredited. The biggest moment for Biden over the past two weeks was the endorsement of a 14-term congressman and member of congressional leadership who has the credibility to move votes in South Carolina. A jaw-dropping 61 percent of voters said Clyburn’s endorsement was important in their decision.          After Biden’s smashing victory in South Carolina, the party fell in line amazingly quickly. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar got out and endorsed Biden, and former candidate Beto O’Rourke did the same. Buttigieg endorsed after reportedly talking to Obama. It was a collective action of the sort that Republicans couldn’t manage in 2016.          This was in part because there was no one suitable to rally around. Jeb Bush’s association with the two past presidents of his party was a liability because it played into the charge of dynasty and any establishment mobilization on his behalf would have looked untoward. Besides, Jeb Bush had the poor early showings of Biden without the reservoir of support among a key base of voters, like Biden’s strength among African Americans.          It was Ted Cruz who was the only viable alternative to Trump. But no one wanted to come to his aid. He wasn’t a longtime party fixture considered fondly even by his competitors, but an ambitious newcomer who had alienated his colleagues and frightened the establishment. Nor was anyone prepared to defer to him as an elder statesman who had earned “his turn.”          On top of this, Trump scrambled ideological categories with his heterodox candidacy and even piqued the curiosity of elements of the GOP old guard. Sanders, in contrast, catalyzed a straight left vs. moderate fight and occasioned the uniform fear and loathing of the Democratic establishment.          Finally, Republicans wanted to throw caution to the wind. The last two candidates identified with the establishment, John McCain and Mitt Romney, had lost, and the Republican victories in the midterm elections in 2010 and 2014 had delivered less than the party’s base had expected. It was a time for risks and for strong medicine — because, really, how could things get worse?          The mood of a swath of the Democratic Party is the opposite — extreme nervousness about messing up its opportunity to defeat Trump, leading to a cautious, practical-minded focus on electability.          What will be the upshot of the party’s effort to stall Sanders? That we don’t know. Party establishments can fail two ways. They can be ineffectual and they can be wrong. Republicans failed to stop Trump in 2016, at the same time that fears he couldn’t win the election proved unfounded. Meanwhile, Democrats tilted the playing field toward Hillary Clinton and succeeded only in elevating a historically weak candidate particularly ill-suited to running against Trump.          This year, the Democratic establishment may yet again, in much more dire circumstances (Sanders never looked like he was really going to defeat Clintonin 2016), thwart Sanders. Yet the party is throwing itself into the arms of a septuagenarian with serious performance issues for lack of a better alternative. We won’t know if this is a smashing success or grievous mistake, born of desperation, until November.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sanders on top: Key takeaways from the Nevada caucuses</td>\n",
       "      <td>LAS VEGAS -- Sen. Bernie Sanders cruised to victory in the Nevada caucuses, heartening his supporters and stoking alarm among moderates who fear he is too liberal and would lose to President Donald Trump.          Sanders' convincing win means there is no longer an asterisk next to his status as the front-runner in the race. He proved his strength with a broad coalition that included Latino voters, union members and African Americans.          Now Sanders claims three victories in a row heading into South Carolina next Saturday, and more important, Super Tuesday on March 3 when about one-third of the delegates needed for the nomination are at stake. The biggest prizes that day, California and Texas, look a lot like Nevada demographically.          Another advantage: His opponents remain splintered and, with the exception of billionaire former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, under-funded to compete across such a vast terrain.          But now there will be extraordinary pressure to try to consolidate moderate support in an effort to stop Sanders' rise. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren will have a decision to make on how much she tries to draw separation from Sanders since they are both competing for the progressive vote.          There is at least one strong note of caution about Sanders' success. In Iowa and New Hampshire he didn't seem to grow the electorate substantially. Data is still out in Nevada.          Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg ran well behind Sanders, but he tried to cast himself as the strongest alternative to Sanders.          In language uncharacteristically blunt, Buttigieg issued a warning to Democrats about the perils of nominating Sanders, whom he characterized as inflexible and whose ideas are not in the American mainstream.          “Sen. Sanders believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans,” Buttigieg told supporters. He held himself out as the only viable alternative. “We can prioritize either ideological purity or inclusive victory,” Buttigieg said.          He added: “Sen. Sanders sees capitalism as the root of all evil. He’d go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support.”          Despite his forceful argument, there’s a serious risk to Buttigieg in the upcoming calendar. He will have to win over black voters in South Carolina, then pivot to a multistate primary with comparatively limited resources. Buttigieg put out a plea for $13 million from donors before Super Tuesday.          The former mayor of a city of 100,000 has repeatedly defied the odds in the presidential nominating contests, but the odds are getting longer.          BIDEN HAS HIS BACK AGAINST A FIREWALL          Former Vice President Joe Biden was hoping Nevada would turn things around for him after a disastrous showing in Iowa and then New Hampshire. He argued that he'd do better in a more diverse state.          But Biden again lost badly even as he told supporters at a union hall, “We’re alive and coming back and we’re gonna win.”          His last and best hope may be to win in South Carolina next Saturday. He’s counting on his support among the state’s black voters — they could make up two-thirds of the voters — to serve as his firewall.          If Biden doesn't win South Carolina, the rationale for his candidacy will much harder to maintain.          In Las Vegas, he tried out a new rallying cry: \"I ain't a socialist. I ain't a plutocrat. I'm a Democrat. And I'm proud of it.\" Party loyalty may be all Biden has left.          MAYBE CULINARY ISN'T ALL-POWERFUL AFTER ALL          The 60,000-member Culinary Workers Local 226 represents workers in the casinos on the Las Vegas strip, and it’s routinely described, correctly, as the most powerful force in the state’s Democratic politics. But it’s not omnipotent.          Culinary didn’t want Sanders to win. It has strongly opposed his “Medicare for All” plan, warning its members that it would eliminate their own generous health plan. Some observers thought the union might end up backing Biden. But after the former vice president’s embarrassing performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, Culinary instead stayed neutral.          The calls from leadership went unheeded by many. Sanders had strong showings in some caucuses in casinos where crowds of Culinary members chanted the Vermont senator’s name and powered him to wins in most casinos. Culinary is driven by its members, many of whom are Sanders supporters, and there was no consensus among the rest about what they should do.          Leadership decided to refrain from a divisive fight, helping pave the way for Sanders’ win. It’s a reminder that even in places like Nevada with strong political institutions, those institutions ultimately derive their power from voters.          Sen. Amy Klobuchar produced one of the few surprises of the race when she surged to a third-place finish in New Hampshire, announced that she had raised more than $12 million, and vowed to prove her doubters wrong.          Her momentum proved short-lived. She finished well behind the leading candidates, and in the process, prompted questions about her viability.          But in a speech to supporters in her home state of Minnesota, she was defiant and said she would continue. She even tried to make a virtue of the fact that Trump mentioned her name at a rally. “By the way, for the first time ever, he mentioned me at a rally,” she said. “You know I’ve arrived now. You know they must be worried.”          Probably not. Time is running out for candidates who haven't finished higher than third in any contest. That also applies to Warren, also desperately needs a win. Her strong debate performance came after much of the state had already cast early votes.          Tom Steyer, the billionaire who made his fortune running a hedge fund, bet heavily in Nevada, more than $12 million on advertising, and lost big, finishing sixth. Steyer has made strong appeals to minority voters, but in Nevada, failed decisively.          But Steyer's impact on the race could come next week in South Carolina, where he has spent even more money. Polls show that he has made significant inroads among African American voters. That would not be good news for Biden, who is counting on those votes to resuscitate his campaign.</td>\n",

       "      <td>medianame Business Network host Charles Payne said Wednesday that the stock market was breathing a \"giant sigh of relief that socialism lost last night and that we will not get rid of our entire health care system.”          Payne made the comments on “America’s Newsroom” the day after former Vice President Joe Biden’s strong showing on Super Tuesday lifted health care stocks. With votes still being counted, Biden had secured about 453 delegates on Super Tuesday, according to the Associated Press, capping a dramatic comeback after his campaign was left for dead following the Nevada caucus on Feb. 22. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the self-declared democratic socialist and perceived frontrunner ahead of Tuesday night, had secured 382 delegates. Health care stocks, led by the insurers, soared in response to Biden’s big night. The names had been badly beaten down, underperforming the S&amp;P 500, as Sanders, who is an advocate of Medicare-for-all, climbed in the polls. On Wednesday, Payne said Sanders’ “overwhelming victory in Nevada” and coronavirus fears “both had an effect” on the market. BIDEN SURGES TO VICTORY ACROSS SUPER TUESDAY MAP, AS SANDERS CLAIMS DELEGATE PRIZE IN CALIFORNIA          He then noted that on Wednesday health care stocks surged “a lot more than the overall market.”          “Health care is up 4.4 percent. S&amp;P is up 2.2 percent. It’s up 100 percent more than the rest of the market,” Payne pointed out. “There is a giant sigh of relief that socialism lost last night and that we will not get rid of our entire health care system. There’s a giant sigh of relief on Main Street and some of that is reflected on Wall Street.”          Payne cautioned that the markets overall are still jittery amid the coronavirus outbreak. \"Utility stocks, consumer staples and real estate, those are all considered cautionary places that you put your money when you’re worried, so this is not a runaway market, but it is a sigh of relief.”          Payne went on to say that he thinks that “as we get closer to the actual election, the markets will start to get a little anxious about Biden,\" though not on the same level as the prospect of Sanders winning the nomination.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It’s the day when the greatest number of US states cast their votes to nominate presidential candidates, who will eventually compete for the White House in November’s general election.          It is the biggest day in the US election calendar apart from election day itself. The candidates have each held hundreds of meet-and-greet events, travelled thousands of miles, eaten a lot of junk food, and their campaigns have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to get them to this make-or-break moment.          In 2020, Super Tuesday falls on 3 March. Both Democrats and Republicans will be voting, but because Donald Trump does not face any serious challengers, all eyes will be on the Democratic contest.          The early voting states – Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina – have all had their say over the past month, with Bernie Sanders emerging as the possible national frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination.          But now, 14 states across the country – Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia – as well as one US territory (American Samoa) and Democrats abroad will cast their votes on the same day.          Who are the Democratic presidential candidates?          There are eight leading Democratic presidential candidates competing: former vice-president Joe Biden, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, former mayors Mike Bloomberg and Pete Buttigieg, billionaire philanthropist Tom Steyer and Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.          Sanders and Warren are on the progressive side of the party, while candidates such as Biden, Klobuchar, Bloomberg and Buttigieg are regarded as more moderate.          This will be the first time that Bloomberg will be on the ballot, and will be a key test of whether the hundreds of millions of dollars he has invested in his own campaign have paid off. He controversially skipped the first early voting states to concentrate on winning support in larger, delegate heavy states.          The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and US territories, by which the party selects its presidential nominee.          The goal for the candidates is to amass a majority of pledged delegates whose job it is to nominate the candidate at the party’s convention. In all states, delegates are awarded proportionally among top winners.          To become the Democratic presidential nominee, the candidate must secure 1,991 pledged delegates from a total of 4,750.          So far, less than 5% of delegates have been allotted, but on Super Tuesday, more than a third of available delegates are up for grabs – giving it the potential to propel one candidate to frontrunner status, and prompt others who perform badly to quit the race.          California has the most pledged delegates (494) followed by Texas (261), North Carolina (72) and Virginia (65).          The Super Tuesday states also represent a much broader sweep of the US population, not just in terms of geography, but demographics too, than the early voting states. The results will therefore give a more detailed picture of who supports the candidates, and what their chances of winning on a national level may be.          Do all the states vote at the same time?          Polling times vary state by state. Vermont’s polls close first at 7pm ET and California’s close last at 11pm ET.          More than a week ahead of Super Tuesday, almost 2m ballots had already been cast as several states allow early voting.          What time will the results be announced?          Results will begin to be reported after the first polls close at 7pm ET. medianame will be reporting the results live, as they come in.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For much of the Democratic nomination battle, it’s been assumed that Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are dividing the far-left vote and making it more likely that Joe Biden will win. In reality, the most realistic path that progressives have for denying Biden the nomination likely involves both Warren and Sanders remaining in the race until the bitter end.          On the surface, the argument for why liberals would be better off with either Warren or Sanders in the race rather than both is straightforward. Add their support together in national and early state polls, and they easily surpass Biden. In the run-up to Iowa, the clash between Warren and Sanders would seemingly be an acknowledgment that for one of them to win, they have to take out the other to consolidate the anti-Biden vote.          Even if it were plausibly true that had, say, Sanders decided to stay out of the race and endorse Warren from the get-go, that there would be higher odds of a liberal candidate defeating Biden, that ship has long since sailed. Both candidates will be in the race at least until Iowa. So the question at this point is whether the Left is better off with one of them dropping out early, or with both of them trying to stay in for the long haul.          Biden remains in a position to finish at or near the top in Iowa and New Hampshire, and if he’s able to survive those contests, he has a much better chance of amassing delegates as the race moves to South Carolina and other states with a large percentage of black voters. Thus, if Warren and Sanders fail to bury him in Iowa and New Hampshire, the best shot at stopping Biden may be on the convention floor. The possibility of a contested convention is more likely in 2020 than in most years as a result of the way that Democrats allocate delegates, as well as the size of the field.          Under a rules change, superdelegates who are allowed to vote for any candidate they want are barred from casting a decisive vote on the first ballot. That is, if Biden does not win a majority of delegates outright, then he’ll have to win the nomination when Democrats gather in Milwaukee in July. If both Sanders and Warren can remain viable, it increases the odds that they will be able to deny Biden an outright majority.          Though there may be some degree of overlap between Warren and Sanders voters, their supporters are not interchangeable. Some Warren voters may prefer her policy proposals or simply want somebody younger or female. Sanders voters may view him as more authentically dedicated to the “revolution” or may have bought into the argument that it would be harder for a woman to beat President Trump. A recent Morning Consult found that nearly as many Sanders supporters chose Biden as their second choice (27%) as Warren (30%). Warren supporters were more likely to gravitate to Sanders as their second choice, but still, only 37% of her supporters chose him as the next best option. There is also a “Bernie or bust” crowd that would not vote if he were not on the ballot.          Were Sanders and Warren to both remain in the race through the primaries, they would be able to capture more voters collectively than they would otherwise be able to were only one of them to survive. Biden’s share of the vote will be further carved up if additional candidates, such as Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, do well enough in the early states to stay in or if Michael Bloomberg takes off in some of the later states where he's unloading tens of millions of dollars.          Anti-Trump Republicans attempted a similar strategy in 2016, hoping that the combined votes for Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, along with John Kasich, would deny Trump a majority of delegates. However, Trump benefited from a delegate allocation process that more heavily favored the statewide winner, whereas Democrats allocate delegates proportionately, meaning that even candidates who don’t win a given state can swallow up delegates if they can get to 15% either statewide or in targeted congressional districts.          As an example, when Trump won winner-take-all Florida, he received of the vote, but all 99 of the state’s delegates. In South Carolina, Trump garnered under one-third of the vote, but he claimed all 50 of the state’s delegates because with Cruz and Rubio nearly tied at 22%, Trump was able to win the state and every congressional district. Those two states alone gave him more than 10% of the total needed to capture the Republican nomination. Had the GOP followed Democratic delegate allocation rules, instead of receiving 149 delegates between those two states, Trump likely would have ended up with less than half that amount.          So though it may seem counterintuitive, no matter which one they support, liberals interested in stopping Biden should be rooting for both Warren and Sanders to remain viable for as long as possible.</td>\n",

If Republicans couldn’t unite to blunt Trump, why would Democrats fare any better against Sanders?          That the Democrats managed it speaks to the different mood and dynamic of the party compared with the GOP in 2016.          Four years ago, Republicans loathed their party establishment and had turned their backs on their immediate past president, George W. Bush, who left office saddled with an unpopular war and a devastating financial crisis. Sanders wants to foment a revolution against the Democratic establishment. This resonates with his supporters but isn’t a widespread sentiment within the party.          As Peter Beinart points out in The Atlantic, Bush and his signature initiative, the Iraq War, weren’t popular with Republicans, whereas Barack Obama and his signature initiative, Obamacare, are popular with Democrats.          This made it possible for Biden to run on restoration rather than revolution and find an audience, especially in South Carolina, where many voters told exit pollsters they wanted a return to Obama policies.          It also meant that, as a general matter, pillars of the party establishment hadn’t been discredited. The biggest moment for Biden over the past two weeks was the endorsement of a 14-term congressman and member of congressional leadership who has the credibility to move votes in South Carolina. A jaw-dropping 61 percent of voters said Clyburn’s endorsement was important in their decision.          After Biden’s smashing victory in South Carolina, the party fell in line amazingly quickly. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar got out and endorsed Biden, and former candidate Beto O’Rourke did the same. Buttigieg endorsed after reportedly talking to Obama. It was a collective action of the sort that Republicans couldn’t manage in 2016.          This was in part because there was no one suitable to rally around. Jeb Bush’s association with the two past presidents of his party was a liability because it played into the charge of dynasty and any establishment mobilization on his behalf would have looked untoward. Besides, Jeb Bush had the poor early showings of Biden without the reservoir of support among a key base of voters, like Biden’s strength among African Americans.          It was Ted Cruz who was the only viable alternative to Trump. But no one wanted to come to his aid. He wasn’t a longtime party fixture considered fondly even by his competitors, but an ambitious newcomer who had alienated his colleagues and frightened the establishment. Nor was anyone prepared to defer to him as an elder statesman who had earned “his turn.”          On top of this, Trump scrambled ideological categories with his heterodox candidacy and even piqued the curiosity of elements of the GOP old guard. Sanders, in contrast, catalyzed a straight left vs. moderate fight and occasioned the uniform fear and loathing of the Democratic establishment.          Finally, Republicans wanted to throw caution to the wind. The last two candidates identified with the establishment, John McCain and Mitt Romney, had lost, and the Republican victories in the midterm elections in 2010 and 2014 had delivered less than the party’s base had expected. It was a time for risks and for strong medicine — because, really, how could things get worse?          The mood of a swath of the Democratic Party is the opposite — extreme nervousness about messing up its opportunity to defeat Trump, leading to a cautious, practical-minded focus on electability.          What will be the upshot of the party’s effort to stall Sanders? That we don’t know. Party establishments can fail two ways. They can be ineffectual and they can be wrong. Republicans failed to stop Trump in 2016, at the same time that fears he couldn’t win the election proved unfounded. Meanwhile, Democrats tilted the playing field toward Hillary Clinton and succeeded only in elevating a historically weak candidate particularly ill-suited to running against Trump.          This year, the Democratic establishment may yet again, in much more dire circumstances (Sanders never looked like he was really going to defeat Clintonin 2016), thwart Sanders. Yet the party is throwing itself into the arms of a septuagenarian with serious performance issues for lack of a better alternative. We won’t know if this is a smashing success or grievous mistake, born of desperation, until November.\n",
       "547                                                 Sanders on top: Key takeaways from the Nevada caucuses  LAS VEGAS -- Sen. Bernie Sanders cruised to victory in the Nevada caucuses, heartening his supporters and stoking alarm among moderates who fear he is too liberal and would lose to President Donald Trump.          Sanders' convincing win means there is no longer an asterisk next to his status as the front-runner in the race. He proved his strength with a broad coalition that included Latino voters, union members and African Americans.          Now Sanders claims three victories in a row heading into South Carolina next Saturday, and more important, Super Tuesday on March 3 when about one-third of the delegates needed for the nomination are at stake. The biggest prizes that day, California and Texas, look a lot like Nevada demographically.          Another advantage: His opponents remain splintered and, with the exception of billionaire former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, under-funded to compete across such a vast terrain.          But now there will be extraordinary pressure to try to consolidate moderate support in an effort to stop Sanders' rise. And Sen. Elizabeth Warren will have a decision to make on how much she tries to draw separation from Sanders since they are both competing for the progressive vote.          There is at least one strong note of caution about Sanders' success. In Iowa and New Hampshire he didn't seem to grow the electorate substantially. Data is still out in Nevada.          Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg ran well behind Sanders, but he tried to cast himself as the strongest alternative to Sanders.          In language uncharacteristically blunt, Buttigieg issued a warning to Democrats about the perils of nominating Sanders, whom he characterized as inflexible and whose ideas are not in the American mainstream.          “Sen. Sanders believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans,” Buttigieg told supporters. He held himself out as the only viable alternative. “We can prioritize either ideological purity or inclusive victory,” Buttigieg said.          He added: “Sen. Sanders sees capitalism as the root of all evil. He’d go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support.”          Despite his forceful argument, there’s a serious risk to Buttigieg in the upcoming calendar. He will have to win over black voters in South Carolina, then pivot to a multistate primary with comparatively limited resources. Buttigieg put out a plea for $13 million from donors before Super Tuesday.          The former mayor of a city of 100,000 has repeatedly defied the odds in the presidential nominating contests, but the odds are getting longer.          BIDEN HAS HIS BACK AGAINST A FIREWALL          Former Vice President Joe Biden was hoping Nevada would turn things around for him after a disastrous showing in Iowa and then New Hampshire. He argued that he'd do better in a more diverse state.          But Biden again lost badly even as he told supporters at a union hall, “We’re alive and coming back and we’re gonna win.”          His last and best hope may be to win in South Carolina next Saturday. He’s counting on his support among the state’s black voters — they could make up two-thirds of the voters — to serve as his firewall.          If Biden doesn't win South Carolina, the rationale for his candidacy will much harder to maintain.          In Las Vegas, he tried out a new rallying cry: \"I ain't a socialist. I ain't a plutocrat. I'm a Democrat. And I'm proud of it.\" Party loyalty may be all Biden has left.          MAYBE CULINARY ISN'T ALL-POWERFUL AFTER ALL          The 60,000-member Culinary Workers Local 226 represents workers in the casinos on the Las Vegas strip, and it’s routinely described, correctly, as the most powerful force in the state’s Democratic politics. But it’s not omnipotent.          Culinary didn’t want Sanders to win. It has strongly opposed his “Medicare for All” plan, warning its members that it would eliminate their own generous health plan. Some observers thought the union might end up backing Biden. But after the former vice president’s embarrassing performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, Culinary instead stayed neutral.          The calls from leadership went unheeded by many. Sanders had strong showings in some caucuses in casinos where crowds of Culinary members chanted the Vermont senator’s name and powered him to wins in most casinos. Culinary is driven by its members, many of whom are Sanders supporters, and there was no consensus among the rest about what they should do.          Leadership decided to refrain from a divisive fight, helping pave the way for Sanders’ win. It’s a reminder that even in places like Nevada with strong political institutions, those institutions ultimately derive their power from voters.          Sen. Amy Klobuchar produced one of the few surprises of the race when she surged to a third-place finish in New Hampshire, announced that she had raised more than $12 million, and vowed to prove her doubters wrong.          Her momentum proved short-lived. She finished well behind the leading candidates, and in the process, prompted questions about her viability.          But in a speech to supporters in her home state of Minnesota, she was defiant and said she would continue. She even tried to make a virtue of the fact that Trump mentioned her name at a rally. “By the way, for the first time ever, he mentioned me at a rally,” she said. “You know I’ve arrived now. You know they must be worried.”          Probably not. Time is running out for candidates who haven't finished higher than third in any contest. That also applies to Warren, also desperately needs a win. Her strong debate performance came after much of the state had already cast early votes.          Tom Steyer, the billionaire who made his fortune running a hedge fund, bet heavily in Nevada, more than $12 million on advertising, and lost big, finishing sixth. Steyer has made strong appeals to minority voters, but in Nevada, failed decisively.          But Steyer's impact on the race could come next week in South Carolina, where he has spent even more money. Polls show that he has made significant inroads among African American voters. That would not be good news for Biden, who is counting on those votes to resuscitate his campaign.\n",

With votes still being counted, Biden had secured about 453 delegates on Super Tuesday, according to the Associated Press, capping a dramatic comeback after his campaign was left for dead following the Nevada caucus on Feb. 22. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the self-declared democratic socialist and perceived frontrunner ahead of Tuesday night, had secured 382 delegates. Health care stocks, led by the insurers, soared in response to Biden’s big night. The names had been badly beaten down, underperforming the S&P 500, as Sanders, who is an advocate of Medicare-for-all, climbed in the polls. On Wednesday, Payne said Sanders’ “overwhelming victory in Nevada” and coronavirus fears “both had an effect” on the market. BIDEN SURGES TO VICTORY ACROSS SUPER TUESDAY MAP, AS SANDERS CLAIMS DELEGATE PRIZE IN CALIFORNIA          He then noted that on Wednesday health care stocks surged “a lot more than the overall market.”          “Health care is up 4.4 percent. S&P is up 2.2 percent. It’s up 100 percent more than the rest of the market,” Payne pointed out. “There is a giant sigh of relief that socialism lost last night and that we will not get rid of our entire health care system. There’s a giant sigh of relief on Main Street and some of that is reflected on Wall Street.”          Payne cautioned that the markets overall are still jittery amid the coronavirus outbreak. \"Utility stocks, consumer staples and real estate, those are all considered cautionary places that you put your money when you’re worried, so this is not a runaway market, but it is a sigh of relief.”          Payne went on to say that he thinks that “as we get closer to the actual election, the markets will start to get a little anxious about Biden,\" though not on the same level as the prospect of Sanders winning the nomination.\n",

It is the biggest day in the US election calendar apart from election day itself. The candidates have each held hundreds of meet-and-greet events, travelled thousands of miles, eaten a lot of junk food, and their campaigns have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to get them to this make-or-break moment.          In 2020, Super Tuesday falls on 3 March. Both Democrats and Republicans will be voting, but because Donald Trump does not face any serious challengers, all eyes will be on the Democratic contest.          The early voting states – Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina – have all had their say over the past month, with Bernie Sanders emerging as the possible national frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination.          But now, 14 states across the country – Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia – as well as one US territory (American Samoa) and Democrats abroad will cast their votes on the same day.          Who are the Democratic presidential candidates?          There are eight leading Democratic presidential candidates competing: former vice-president Joe Biden, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, former mayors Mike Bloomberg and Pete Buttigieg, billionaire philanthropist Tom Steyer and Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.          Sanders and Warren are on the progressive side of the party, while candidates such as Biden, Klobuchar, Bloomberg and Buttigieg are regarded as more moderate.          This will be the first time that Bloomberg will be on the ballot, and will be a key test of whether the hundreds of millions of dollars he has invested in his own campaign have paid off. He controversially skipped the first early voting states to concentrate on winning support in larger, delegate heavy states.          The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and US territories, by which the party selects its presidential nominee.          The goal for the candidates is to amass a majority of pledged delegates whose job it is to nominate the candidate at the party’s convention. In all states, delegates are awarded proportionally among top winners.          To become the Democratic presidential nominee, the candidate must secure 1,991 pledged delegates from a total of 4,750.          So far, less than 5% of delegates have been allotted, but on Super Tuesday, more than a third of available delegates are up for grabs – giving it the potential to propel one candidate to frontrunner status, and prompt others who perform badly to quit the race.          California has the most pledged delegates (494) followed by Texas (261), North Carolina (72) and Virginia (65).          The Super Tuesday states also represent a much broader sweep of the US population, not just in terms of geography, but demographics too, than the early voting states. The results will therefore give a more detailed picture of who supports the candidates, and what their chances of winning on a national level may be.          Do all the states vote at the same time?          Polling times vary state by state. Vermont’s polls close first at 7pm ET and California’s close last at 11pm ET.          More than a week ahead of Super Tuesday, almost 2m ballots had already been cast as several states allow early voting.          What time will the results be announced?          Results will begin to be reported after the first polls close at 7pm ET. medianame will be reporting the results live, as they come in.\n",

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are dividing the far-left vote and making it more likely that Joe Biden will win. In reality, the most realistic path that progressives have for denying Biden the nomination likely involves both Warren and Sanders remaining in the race until the bitter end.          On the surface, the argument for why liberals would be better off with either Warren or Sanders in the race rather than both is straightforward. Add their support together in national and early state polls, and they easily surpass Biden. In the run-up to Iowa, the clash between Warren and Sanders would seemingly be an acknowledgment that for one of them to win, they have to take out the other to consolidate the anti-Biden vote.          Even if it were plausibly true that had, say, Sanders decided to stay out of the race and endorse Warren from the get-go, that there would be higher odds of a liberal candidate defeating Biden, that ship has long since sailed. Both candidates will be in the race at least until Iowa. So the question at this point is whether the Left is better off with one of them dropping out early, or with both of them trying to stay in for the long haul.          Biden remains in a position to finish at or near the top in Iowa and New Hampshire, and if he’s able to survive those contests, he has a much better chance of amassing delegates as the race moves to South Carolina and other states with a large percentage of black voters. Thus, if Warren and Sanders fail to bury him in Iowa and New Hampshire, the best shot at stopping Biden may be on the convention floor. The possibility of a contested convention is more likely in 2020 than in most years as a result of the way that Democrats allocate delegates, as well as the size of the field.          Under a rules change, superdelegates who are allowed to vote for any candidate they want are barred from casting a decisive vote on the first ballot. That is, if Biden does not win a majority of delegates outright, then he’ll have to win the nomination when Democrats gather in Milwaukee in July. If both Sanders and Warren can remain viable, it increases the odds that they will be able to deny Biden an outright majority.          Though there may be some degree of overlap between Warren and Sanders voters, their supporters are not interchangeable. Some Warren voters may prefer her policy proposals or simply want somebody younger or female. Sanders voters may view him as more authentically dedicated to the “revolution” or may have bought into the argument that it would be harder for a woman to beat President Trump. A recent Morning Consult found that nearly as many Sanders supporters chose Biden as their second choice (27%) as Warren (30%). Warren supporters were more likely to gravitate to Sanders as their second choice, but still, only 37% of her supporters chose him as the next best option. There is also a “Bernie or bust” crowd that would not vote if he were not on the ballot.          Were Sanders and Warren to both remain in the race through the primaries, they would be able to capture more voters collectively than they would otherwise be able to were only one of them to survive. Biden’s share of the vote will be further carved up if additional candidates, such as Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, do well enough in the early states to stay in or if Michael Bloomberg takes off in some of the later states where he's unloading tens of millions of dollars.          Anti-Trump Republicans attempted a similar strategy in 2016, hoping that the combined votes for Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, along with John Kasich, would deny Trump a majority of delegates. However, Trump benefited from a delegate allocation process that more heavily favored the statewide winner, whereas Democrats allocate delegates proportionately, meaning that even candidates who don’t win a given state can swallow up delegates if they can get to 15% either statewide or in targeted congressional districts.          As an example, when Trump won winner-take-all Florida, he received of the vote, but all 99 of the state’s delegates. In South Carolina, Trump garnered under one-third of the vote, but he claimed all 50 of the state’s delegates because with Cruz and Rubio nearly tied at 22%, Trump was able to win the state and every congressional district. Those two states alone gave him more than 10% of the total needed to capture the Republican nomination. Had the GOP followed Democratic delegate allocation rules, instead of receiving 149 delegates between those two states, Trump likely would have ended up with less than half that amount.          So though it may seem counterintuitive, no matter which one they support, liberals interested in stopping Biden should be rooting for both Warren and Sanders to remain viable for as long as possible."

       "      <td>(medianame) America's most senior general warned that \"divisiveness leads to defeat\" in a speech to Naval War College graduates on Wednesday.          Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley counseled the audience to \"eliminate anything that divides us.\"          While he also spoke of the traditional need to keep an eye on adversaries \"during periods when we are weary from conflict or otherwise preoccupied,\" and did not mention President Donald Trump by name, his comments appeared to address the broader backdrop of racial divisiveness in the country and concerns within the Pentagon about the military becoming politicized.          Milley told the students, \"We who wear the cloth of our nation must hold dear the principle of an apolitical military that is so deeply rooted in the very essence of our Republic.\"          His speech followed Defense Secretary Mark Esper's announcement of a major review last week aimed at improving diversity and \"ensuring equal opportunity across all ranks\" of the US military.          The Pentagon effort to address racism and promote equality, even as leaders try to avoid White House politics, has been notable and follows Milley's extraordinary apology for appearing in a photo-op with Trump after the forceful dispersal of peaceful protesters outside the White House earlier this month.          Esper similarly acknowledged the problematic nature of his own appearance and later told reporters he did not want to see active duty forces on the streets of Washington, DC -- a statement that increased tensions between the Pentagon and the White House.          Several current defense officials with access to both men say the two are deeply concerned about Trump attempting to politicize the military and potentially dragging the forces into the presidential election campaign.          \"Both realize over the last month that the Defense Department has been overexposed and politicized\" a senior administration official said, blaming both the White House and Democrats.          While there are always political tensions as an election looms, Trump has done little to assure Esper or Milley of his unqualified support for them. In an interview with Axios , Trump said Esper and Milley should have been \"proud\" to be with in the photo-op.          Esper has repeatedly let it be known he thought Trump might fire him and he had also prepared a letter of resignation earlier this month. Similarly, Milley consulted a number of senior retired and military officers to seek their advice on whether he could continue effectively in the role, according to officials with direct knowledge.          While Milley has made two speeches to military audiences, and Esper has visited some military bases, neither of them has engaged publicly or answered questions from the press in recent weeks.          On Wednesday, Esper departed for meetings at NATO in Brussels, in part to discuss Trump's orders to remove 10,000 troops from Germany , something the Pentagon is not anxious to do in the face of Russian aggression in eastern Europe. That trip is expected to be very low key with Esper currently not scheduled to speak publicly.          However, Esper and Milley may not be able to avoid tough questions for long.          There are tentative plans for them to testify before the House Armed Services Committee just after the July 4 recess about the use of National Guard troops and the calling up of active duty forces during the recent protests prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.          That hearing could be the first time the brewing tensions between the Pentagon and the White House are brought clearly into the public view.</td>\n",

       "0  Top general warns that 'divisiveness leads to defeat' as Pentagon concerns over politicization grow  (medianame) America's most senior general warned that \"divisiveness leads to defeat\" in a speech to Naval War College graduates on Wednesday.          Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley counseled the audience to \"eliminate anything that divides us.\"          While he also spoke of the traditional need to keep an eye on adversaries \"during periods when we are weary from conflict or otherwise preoccupied,\" and did not mention President Donald Trump by name, his comments appeared to address the broader backdrop of racial divisiveness in the country and concerns within the Pentagon about the military becoming politicized.          Milley told the students, \"We who wear the cloth of our nation must hold dear the principle of an apolitical military that is so deeply rooted in the very essence of our Republic.\"          His speech followed Defense Secretary Mark Esper's announcement of a major review last week aimed at improving diversity and \"ensuring equal opportunity across all ranks\" of the US military.          The Pentagon effort to address racism and promote equality, even as leaders try to avoid White House politics, has been notable and follows Milley's extraordinary apology for appearing in a photo-op with Trump after the forceful dispersal of peaceful protesters outside the White House earlier this month.          Esper similarly acknowledged the problematic nature of his own appearance and later told reporters he did not want to see active duty forces on the streets of Washington, DC -- a statement that increased tensions between the Pentagon and the White House.          Several current defense officials with access to both men say the two are deeply concerned about Trump attempting to politicize the military and potentially dragging the forces into the presidential election campaign.          \"Both realize over the last month that the Defense Department has been overexposed and politicized\" a senior administration official said, blaming both the White House and Democrats.          While there are always political tensions as an election looms, Trump has done little to assure Esper or Milley of his unqualified support for them. In an interview with Axios , Trump said Esper and Milley should have been \"proud\" to be with in the photo-op.          Esper has repeatedly let it be known he thought Trump might fire him and he had also prepared a letter of resignation earlier this month. Similarly, Milley consulted a number of senior retired and military officers to seek their advice on whether he could continue effectively in the role, according to officials with direct knowledge.          While Milley has made two speeches to military audiences, and Esper has visited some military bases, neither of them has engaged publicly or answered questions from the press in recent weeks.          On Wednesday, Esper departed for meetings at NATO in Brussels, in part to discuss Trump's orders to remove 10,000 troops from Germany , something the Pentagon is not anxious to do in the face of Russian aggression in eastern Europe. That trip is expected to be very low key with Esper currently not scheduled to speak publicly.          However, Esper and Milley may not be able to avoid tough questions for long.          There are tentative plans for them to testify before the House Armed Services Committee just after the July 4 recess about the use of National Guard troops and the calling up of active duty forces during the recent protests prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.          That hearing could be the first time the brewing tensions between the Pentagon and the White House are brought clearly into the public view.                   -1.0          0   medianame america most senior general warned that divisiveness leads defeat speech naval war college graduates wednesday chairman the joint chiefs staff mark milley counseled the audience eliminate anything that divides while also spoke the traditional need keep eye adversaries during periods when are weary from conflict otherwise preoccupied and did not mention president donald trump name his comments appeared address the broader backdrop racial divisiveness the country and concerns within the pentagon about the military becoming politicized milley told the students who wear the cloth our nation must hold dear the principle apolitical military that deeply rooted the very essence our republic his speech followed defense secretary mark esper announcement major review last week aimed improving diversity and ensuring equal opportunity across all ranks the military the pentagon effort address racism and promote equality even leaders try avoid white house politics has been notable and follows milley extraordinary apology for appearing photo with trump after the forceful dispersal peaceful protesters outside the white house earlier this month esper similarly acknowledged the problematic nature his own appearance and later told reporters did not want see active duty forces the streets washington statement that increased tensions between the pentagon and the white house several current defense officials with access both men say the two are deeply concerned about trump attempting politicize the military and potentially dragging the forces into the presidential election campaign both realize over the last month that the defense department has been overexposed and politicized senior administration official said blaming both the white house and democrats while there are always political tensions election looms trump has done little assure esper milley his unqualified support for them   top general warns that divisiveness leads to defeat as pentagon concerns over politicization grow  medianame america most senior general warned that divisiveness leads defeat speech naval war college graduates wednesday chairman the joint chiefs staff mark milley counseled the audience eliminate anything that divides while also spoke the traditional need keep eye adversaries during periods when are weary from conflict otherwise preoccupied and did not mention president donald trump name his comments appeared address the broader backdrop racial divisiveness the country and concerns within the pentagon about the military becoming politicized milley told the students who wear the cloth our nation must hold dear the principle apolitical military that deeply rooted the very essence our republic his speech followed defense secretary mark esper announcement major review last week aimed improving diversity and ensuring equal opportunity across all ranks the military the pentagon effort address racism and promote equality even leaders try avoid white house politics has been notable and follows milley extraordinary apology for appearing photo with trump after the forceful dispersal peaceful protesters outside the white house earlier this month esper similarly acknowledged the problematic nature his own appearance and later told reporters did not want see active duty forces the streets washington statement that increased tensions between the pentagon and the white house several current defense officials with access both men say the two are deeply concerned about trump attempting politicize the military and potentially dragging the forces into the presidential election campaign both realize over the last month that the defense department has been overexposed and politicized senior administration official said blaming both the white house and democrats while there are always political tensions election looms trump has done little assure esper milley his unqualified support for them          293  top general warns that divisiveness leads to defeat as pentagon concerns over politicization grow             14  [general, warns, pentagon]  [entry, stephen, standards]"

       "      <td>(medianame) America's most senior general warned that \"divisiveness leads to defeat\" in a speech to Naval War College graduates on Wednesday.          Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley counseled the audience to \"eliminate anything that divides us.\"          While he also spoke of the traditional need to keep an eye on adversaries \"during periods when we are weary from conflict or otherwise preoccupied,\" and did not mention President Donald Trump by name, his comments appeared to address the broader backdrop of racial divisiveness in the country and concerns within the Pentagon about the military becoming politicized.          Milley told the students, \"We who wear the cloth of our nation must hold dear the principle of an apolitical military that is so deeply rooted in the very essence of our Republic.\"          His speech followed Defense Secretary Mark Esper's announcement of a major review last week aimed at improving diversity and \"ensuring equal opportunity across all ranks\" of the US military.          The Pentagon effort to address racism and promote equality, even as leaders try to avoid White House politics, has been notable and follows Milley's extraordinary apology for appearing in a photo-op with Trump after the forceful dispersal of peaceful protesters outside the White House earlier this month.          Esper similarly acknowledged the problematic nature of his own appearance and later told reporters he did not want to see active duty forces on the streets of Washington, DC -- a statement that increased tensions between the Pentagon and the White House.          Several current defense officials with access to both men say the two are deeply concerned about Trump attempting to politicize the military and potentially dragging the forces into the presidential election campaign.          \"Both realize over the last month that the Defense Department has been overexposed and politicized\" a senior administration official said, blaming both the White House and Democrats.          While there are always political tensions as an election looms, Trump has done little to assure Esper or Milley of his unqualified support for them. In an interview with Axios , Trump said Esper and Milley should have been \"proud\" to be with in the photo-op.          Esper has repeatedly let it be known he thought Trump might fire him and he had also prepared a letter of resignation earlier this month. Similarly, Milley consulted a number of senior retired and military officers to seek their advice on whether he could continue effectively in the role, according to officials with direct knowledge.          While Milley has made two speeches to military audiences, and Esper has visited some military bases, neither of them has engaged publicly or answered questions from the press in recent weeks.          On Wednesday, Esper departed for meetings at NATO in Brussels, in part to discuss Trump's orders to remove 10,000 troops from Germany , something the Pentagon is not anxious to do in the face of Russian aggression in eastern Europe. That trip is expected to be very low key with Esper currently not scheduled to speak publicly.          However, Esper and Milley may not be able to avoid tough questions for long.          There are tentative plans for them to testify before the House Armed Services Committee just after the July 4 recess about the use of National Guard troops and the calling up of active duty forces during the recent protests prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.          That hearing could be the first time the brewing tensions between the Pentagon and the White House are brought clearly into the public view.</td>\n",

       "0  Top general warns that 'divisiveness leads to defeat' as Pentagon concerns over politicization grow  (medianame) America's most senior general warned that \"divisiveness leads to defeat\" in a speech to Naval War College graduates on Wednesday.          Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley counseled the audience to \"eliminate anything that divides us.\"          While he also spoke of the traditional need to keep an eye on adversaries \"during periods when we are weary from conflict or otherwise preoccupied,\" and did not mention President Donald Trump by name, his comments appeared to address the broader backdrop of racial divisiveness in the country and concerns within the Pentagon about the military becoming politicized.          Milley told the students, \"We who wear the cloth of our nation must hold dear the principle of an apolitical military that is so deeply rooted in the very essence of our Republic.\"          His speech followed Defense Secretary Mark Esper's announcement of a major review last week aimed at improving diversity and \"ensuring equal opportunity across all ranks\" of the US military.          The Pentagon effort to address racism and promote equality, even as leaders try to avoid White House politics, has been notable and follows Milley's extraordinary apology for appearing in a photo-op with Trump after the forceful dispersal of peaceful protesters outside the White House earlier this month.          Esper similarly acknowledged the problematic nature of his own appearance and later told reporters he did not want to see active duty forces on the streets of Washington, DC -- a statement that increased tensions between the Pentagon and the White House.          Several current defense officials with access to both men say the two are deeply concerned about Trump attempting to politicize the military and potentially dragging the forces into the presidential election campaign.          \"Both realize over the last month that the Defense Department has been overexposed and politicized\" a senior administration official said, blaming both the White House and Democrats.          While there are always political tensions as an election looms, Trump has done little to assure Esper or Milley of his unqualified support for them. In an interview with Axios , Trump said Esper and Milley should have been \"proud\" to be with in the photo-op.          Esper has repeatedly let it be known he thought Trump might fire him and he had also prepared a letter of resignation earlier this month. Similarly, Milley consulted a number of senior retired and military officers to seek their advice on whether he could continue effectively in the role, according to officials with direct knowledge.          While Milley has made two speeches to military audiences, and Esper has visited some military bases, neither of them has engaged publicly or answered questions from the press in recent weeks.          On Wednesday, Esper departed for meetings at NATO in Brussels, in part to discuss Trump's orders to remove 10,000 troops from Germany , something the Pentagon is not anxious to do in the face of Russian aggression in eastern Europe. That trip is expected to be very low key with Esper currently not scheduled to speak publicly.          However, Esper and Milley may not be able to avoid tough questions for long.          There are tentative plans for them to testify before the House Armed Services Committee just after the July 4 recess about the use of National Guard troops and the calling up of active duty forces during the recent protests prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.          That hearing could be the first time the brewing tensions between the Pentagon and the White House are brought clearly into the public view.                   -1.0          0   medianame america most senior general warned that divisiveness leads defeat speech naval war college graduates wednesday chairman the joint chiefs staff mark milley counseled the audience eliminate anything that divides while also spoke the traditional need keep eye adversaries during periods when are weary from conflict otherwise preoccupied and did not mention president donald trump name his comments appeared address the broader backdrop racial divisiveness the country and concerns within the pentagon about the military becoming politicized milley told the students who wear the cloth our nation must hold dear the principle apolitical military that deeply rooted the very essence our republic his speech followed defense secretary mark esper announcement major review last week aimed improving diversity and ensuring equal opportunity across all ranks the military the pentagon effort address racism and promote equality even leaders try avoid white house politics has been notable and follows milley extraordinary apology for appearing photo with trump after the forceful dispersal peaceful protesters outside the white house earlier this month esper similarly acknowledged the problematic nature his own appearance and later told reporters did not want see active duty forces the streets washington statement that increased tensions between the pentagon and the white house several current defense officials with access both men say the two are deeply concerned about trump attempting politicize the military and potentially dragging the forces into the presidential election campaign both realize over the last month that the defense department has been overexposed and politicized senior administration official said blaming both the white house and democrats while there are always political tensions election looms trump has done little assure esper milley his unqualified support for them   top general warns that divisiveness leads to defeat as pentagon concerns over politicization grow  medianame america most senior general warned that divisiveness leads defeat speech naval war college graduates wednesday chairman the joint chiefs staff mark milley counseled the audience eliminate anything that divides while also spoke the traditional need keep eye adversaries during periods when are weary from conflict otherwise preoccupied and did not mention president donald trump name his comments appeared address the broader backdrop racial divisiveness the country and concerns within the pentagon about the military becoming politicized milley told the students who wear the cloth our nation must hold dear the principle apolitical military that deeply rooted the very essence our republic his speech followed defense secretary mark esper announcement major review last week aimed improving diversity and ensuring equal opportunity across all ranks the military the pentagon effort address racism and promote equality even leaders try avoid white house politics has been notable and follows milley extraordinary apology for appearing photo with trump after the forceful dispersal peaceful protesters outside the white house earlier this month esper similarly acknowledged the problematic nature his own appearance and later told reporters did not want see active duty forces the streets washington statement that increased tensions between the pentagon and the white house several current defense officials with access both men say the two are deeply concerned about trump attempting politicize the military and potentially dragging the forces into the presidential election campaign both realize over the last month that the defense department has been overexposed and politicized senior administration official said blaming both the white house and democrats while there are always political tensions election looms trump has done little assure esper milley his unqualified support for them          293  top general warns that divisiveness leads to defeat as pentagon concerns over politicization grow             14  [general, warns, pentagon]  [entry, stephen, standards]  [pol, median, counsel]  [contradiction, spear, rang]"
