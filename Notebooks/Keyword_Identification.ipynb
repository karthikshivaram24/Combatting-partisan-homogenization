      "Jessica Tarlov: Trump should be impeached – Republicans who blindly support him are profiles in cowardice\n",
      "When President Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on Dec. 19, 1998 – almost exactly 21 years ago – I was 14 and paying more attention to playing basketball, boys and homework. I knew the impeachment was taking place, but didn’t follow every development.          Things are very different today. I can’t seem to stop paying attention and am oftentimes overwhelmed by the gravity of what we’re witnessing.          Though it’s my job to pay attention, the dynamics of this story – from the president’s abuse of power, to the geopolitics, to the personal stories of those who have testified – would draw anyone in.          Our reality TV president is now the subject of a reality TV impeachment filled with dramatic twists and turns – and the show isn’t over yet.          The evidence in favor of impeachment seems overwhelming to me. And President Trump’s misconduct seems a lot more serious than President Clinton’s.          Clinton lied about sex – but his conduct didn’t endanger our national security or threaten the system of government established in our Constitution.          I agree with Democrats seeking Trump’s impeachment for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.          In my mind, it’s obvious that Trump threatened the president of Ukraine to demand a political favor and improperly held back $391 million in desperately needed military aid approved by Congress to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. Trump eventually gave Ukraine the money – but only after a whistleblower exposed the president’s improper conduct.          It’s even more obvious – and indisputable – that Trump has refused to allow members of his administration to testify before Congress or provide subpoenaed documents for the House impeachment inquiry. Those brave and patriotic officials who testified did so in defiance of Trump’s obstruction.          How can anyone argue with a straight face that Trump didn’t obstruct Congress to block it from carrying out its constitutional oversight responsibility?          The framers of the Constitution created impeachment so that the president of the United States could be held accountable for misconduct. Sure, Trump doesn’t like it. But he doesn’t have the power to ignore the Constitution and follow only the parts of it that he likes.          The action by the House Judiciary Committee Friday adopting the two articles of impeachment against Trump was historic. I find it disappointing that not a single Republican joined Democrats in voting to impeach. It seems they will stick with him no more what, putting party loyalty over patriotism.          When he was running for president Trump said: \"The polls, they say I have the most loyal people. Did you ever see that? Where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK? It's like incredible.\"          When it comes to holding onto Republican support in the House and Senate, I think Trump’s statement is actually true. As he said before, “It’s like incredible.”          The Judiciary Committee vote Friday along party lines to impeach Trump wrapped up a contentious two days of debate that foreshadows continued partisan bickering that will carry over to the Senate in an impeachment trial for the president.          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has made it clear will do Trump’s bidding. It seems that no matter what Trump asks McConnell to do, McConnell will reply: “Yes, sir!”          McConnell admitted as much to Sean Hannity of Fox News, telling Hannity “there will be no difference between the president’s position and our position in how to handle this … there’s no chance the president will be removed from office.”          Too bad McConnell sees himself as Trump’s personal servant rather than the public servant he was elected to be.          I never thought there was a chance Trump would be removed from office by the Senate. But now that McConnell has made it perfectly clear, we can stop fantasizing about Republicans finding some moral courage. Their actions are profiles in cowardice.          In the week ahead the spotlight shifts to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and the full House, when Democrats are expected to impeach Trump by approving the articles of impeachment adopted by the Judiciary Committee.          One of Pelosi’s great strengths has been her willingness to give members free rein to be themselves, vote their conscience and campaign for their districts. This approach was surely critical to Democratic victories in 2018, when Democrats won over 35 seats in purple or red districts to regain majority control of the House.          Pelosi gave Democratic candidates license to do what’s right for their constituents, even if it meant bashing her and committing to not voting for her to regain the gavel if Democrats were in the majority again.          And it worked. Just like it will work again with the impending House vote next week.          There have been a lot of rumblings that Pelosi could lose Democratic votes on impeachment.          Two House members voted against opening the impeachment inquiry – with Pelosi’s blessing – and the conventional wisdom is that there could be more for next week’s vote.          As the Washington Post reported, there are several moderate Democrats who wanted other options, like a censure vote. They could also do what many Democrats did for Clinton’s impeachment and only vote for one article of impeachment to show some degree of independence.          Rep. Elissa Slotkin, one of the freshman Democrats who hails from a vulnerable Trump-supporting district in Michigan, appeared on “America’s Newsroom” on Fox News Channel to discuss the challenges facing Democrats. Her struggle is one that over 30 of her colleagues are grappling with.          That said, Pelosi’s approach to managing her caucus when it comes to the impeachment vote is already paying off. On Thursday and Friday three vulnerable Democrats declared their intention to vote to impeach President Trump.          CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER          Rep. Colin Allred, D-Texas, said: “It is clear the president engaged in an abuse of his authority, putting himself above the law, and his personal interests above the nation’s. These uncontroverted facts are an unacceptable violation of his oath of office and constitute an impeachable abuse of power. This is a somber moment for our nation, and I have not reached this decision lightly.”          Over in Pennsylvania, Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb told a local radio station: “The evidence is strong, and it warrants impeachment. The facts show the president abused his office and compromised our national security. I can't think of anything more serious than that.”          And Rep. Max Rose, D-N.Y., also said he will vote to impeach Trump. “Party and politics will never come before the country I bled to protect – and would unquestionably do so again,” Rose said in a statement. The Army combat veteran who served in Afghanistan and currently serves in the National Guard added: “A President coercing a foreign government into targeting American citizens is not just another example of scorched earth politics, it serves as an invitation to the enemies of the United States to come after any citizen, so long as they disagree with the President.”          CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP          These Democratic House members are well aware of the potential ramifications to their reelection and, at the same time, the importance of making their decision known as a signal to other vulnerable Democrats that this is the right path.          I’m sure we’ll see more of this in the coming days. And Pelosi should stay the course. It won Democrats control of the House in 2018 and will hopefully get a vote to impeach Trump next week.

      "Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna McDaniel on Wednesday said that “nobody is paying attention to” the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president because of the constant impeachment push.          After touting the RNC $25 million raised in October as a good sign for the GOP, McDaniel said the “fake, phony impeachment” is “pulling the wind out” of the 2020 Democratic race.          “[N]obody’s paying attention to this field of Democrats, this expanding field, because the field’s so weak,” McDaniel told “Fox & Friends.” “This impeachment is pulling the wind out of these candidates trying to win their nomination because nobody cares. And all we’re talking about is a fake, phony impeachment of this president’s that’s going to fail.”\n",

      "Maxine Waters vows to ‘get’ Pence once Trump impeached\n",
      "Rep. Maxine Waters promised a crowd of young Democrats over the weekend that she would go after Vice President Mike Pence once President Trump is removed from office.          The California congresswoman accepted a lifetime achievement award from the Stonewall Young Democrats on Saturday in Los Angeles, telling the enthusiastic crowd that Mr. Trump threatened Americans’ way of life and deserved to be impeached.          “I’m gonna get him,” Ms. Waters said, according to a video published by progressive activist and attendee Edward Garren. “I’m in this fight and I’m not gonna move.          “And, as you know, there’s a difference in how some of our leadership talk about how we should handle all of this,” she continued. “They say, ‘Maxine, please don’t say impeachment anymore. ‘And when they say that, I say, ‘Impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.’”          Mrs. Waters recalled a conversation she had earlier that day with someone who argued against impeachment because Mr. Pence “would be worse.”          “I had a conversation here today with someone [who] asked, ‘Well, what about Pence? If you are able to impeach, Pence will be worse,’” Mrs. Waters said. “And I said, ‘Look, one at a time. You knock one down, one at a time.          “You knock one down, and we’ll be ready for Pence. We’ll get him, too,” she said as the crowd cheered.\n",

      "Alan Dershowitz: Impeachment has deeply divided our nation – Why weren't legal experts cross examined?\n",
      "Wednesday’s House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearing squandered an opportunity to educate the public about the criteria for impeaching a president. Instead of each side cross-examining opposing witnesses, Democrats and Republicans mostly threw softballs at their own witnesses. There were a few momentary exceptions, but for the most part what we heard from four legal scholars were prepared lectures that repeated what the witnesses had previously written.          In previous hearings over the years, we have experienced dramatic cross-examination by experienced lawyers that exposed the weaknesses and inconsistencies of witnesses.          It has been said that cross-examination, properly conducted, is the greatest engine for testing truth. Without cross-examination, witnesses simply express their rehearsed views without having them challenged by adversarial questions.          GREGG JARRETT: IMPEACHMENT-OBSESSED DEMOCRATS IGNORE LOGIC AND LAW AS 4 PROFESSORS TESTIFY AT HEARING          Had the Democratic experts been effectively cross-examined, they would have had to justify their contention that the governing criteria for impeachment include abuse of office, corruption, violation of public trust, maladministration, bad conduct, placing partisan interests above national ones, and other vague, open-ended criteria of the kind the framers explicitly rejected.          None of the criteria advocated by the experts appear in the text of the constitution, which limits the grounds for impeachment to “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”          These are the necessary but not sufficient conditions for removing a president. In addition to committing one or more of these designated offenses, the person to be removed must have violated the public trust or abused his office. These criteria are in addition to those explicitly set out in the constitution. They are not substitutes for the constitutional prerequisites for impeachment and removal.          George Washington University Law School Professor Jonathan Turley did a commendable job in raising questions about the dangers of the overbroad Democratic criteria. But presenting an alternative perspective in separate testimony is not as effective as directly confronting witness and demanding answers.          CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER          Turley, too, should have been cross-examined about his view that abuse of office can, if sufficiently extreme, be a constitutional basis for impeachment.          He should have asked about the slippery slope: if abuse is sufficient, how can that subjective criteria be cabined to avoid the dangers he correctly pointed to in his compelling testimony.          I simply don’t understand why both sides forwent the opportunity to cross-examine. They each had excellent and experienced counsel, fully capable of cross-examining opposing witnesses. Yet they spent their time throwing softballs at their own witnesses which accomplished nothing.          The small number of cross-examination questions asked by members of congress were informative but the public would have benefitted more had such adversarial questioning been the norm rather than the exception.          Our nation is deeply divided over the impeachment issue. There is far too little reasoned dialogue and there have been too few constructive exchanges about these different views. Effective cross-examination can force advocates to modify extreme views and to bridge differences. Perhaps neither side wanted that. Their bases demand the uncompromising advocacy of extreme positions. But the American public is entitled to nuance and narrowing of differences.          CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP          The clash of experts at the Judiciary Committee hearing did not serve the interests of the American public. The experts were ships passing in the night. Few minds were changed.          Cross-examination might have narrowed differences and changed some minds.          CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ALAN DERSHOWITZ\n",

      "Trump impeachment inquiry sparked by effort to uncover ‘witch hunt’ origins\n",
      "At the heart of the infamous Ukraine phone call that prompted House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry is President Trump’s vow to get to the bottom of the origins of the Russia probe, which dominated the first two-plus years of his presidency.          In trying to uncover how the “witch hunt” began, Mr. Trump now faces a bigger political crisis.          The Trump campaign came out swinging this weekend against impeachment, launching a $10 million TV and digital ad accusing Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden of meddling in Ukraine. Political insiders say it’s a strong indication of how Mr. Trump intends to fight back.          “He’ll be very aggressive,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. “I think ultimately his game plan is to make sure the base is with him. He understands this is a political fight, not a legal fight, and he’s going to play politics. He knows that if he loses the base, he loses the game.”          Mr. Trump and his aides in the early days of the crisis have gone on the attack against an unnamed government whistleblower who prompted the charges while also firing back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Chairman Adam B. Schiff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The White House message is that this latest political peril for Mr. Trump is all part of the same partisan hatred that has dogged him from the start.          “There are no high crimes and misdemeanors here,” said White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway. “People were talking about impeaching this president before he even got inaugurated. And now they’re getting their wish. Nancy Pelosi finally capitulated to her angry mob.”          She said the American people “will see what’s not getting done” in Congress while Democrats devote their attention to impeaching Mr. Trump in a strong economy.          The president also echoed a prediction Sunday by Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel that the Democrats’ impeachment effort will backfire, especially in Democratic House districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016.          “Will happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in 50 Trump type Districts,” the president tweeted. “We will win big!”          In trying to sustain his 2020 reelection bid, Mr. Trump is still fighting a battle over his 2016 campaign.          The president’s phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 started with pleasantries, but quickly shifted Mr. Trump’s interest in a missing Democratic National Committee server that was hacked by Russia during the 2016 election.          “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine … The server, they say Ukraine has it,” the president told Mr. Zelensky.          He also mentioned the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which the DNC hired in 2016 to investigate the breach of its servers and first reported Russia as the culprit.          The president’s conversation took place a day after special counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress, an appearance that was criticized as weak. Mr. Mueller did confirm the findings of his report, which found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the election.          “As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance,” Mr. Trump told Ukraine’s leader. “But they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”          The Justice Department has announced that U.S. attorney John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the FBI’s “Crossfire Hurricane” probe into alleged links between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia, was already looking into whether the Ukrainian government led by then-President Petro Poroshenko was involved in the effort to torpedo Mr. Trump’s candidacy.          Mr. Zelensky raised the name of the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani had canceled a trip to Ukraine last spring to investigate whether the previous Ukrainian administration helped Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign by providing information concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s lobbying work in the country.          Mr. Giuliani also was probing why Ukraine fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who had been looking into Hunter Biden’s lucrative position with a Ukrainian energy company.          “This is what they [Democrats] did to Manafort,” said veteran Washington lawyer John Down, who represented the president in the Mueller probe. “They went overseas and they dug all this stuff up. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”          The Hill reported in May that the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington said a Democratic National Committee contractor solicited dirt on Manafort during the 2016 campaign and even tried to enlist the country’s president to help.          The contractor later tried to arrange for Mr. Poroshenko to comment on Manafort’s Russian ties during a visit to the U.S. during the 2016 campaign, the Ukrainian ambassador said.          As for Mr. Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, the president’s conservative allies also believe there is a potential connection to the origins of the Russia allegations against Mr. Trump.          “Biden was responsible for U.S. policy in Ukraine during the Obama administration, and much of the false narrative about President Donald Trump being a Russian agent came from Ukraine, the United Kingdom and other Western intelligence agencies, which his administration put a bow on and shipped to the FISA court so they could spy on the Trump campaign in 2016,” said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government. “What did Joe Biden know about Russiagate and when did he know it?”          The president also has directed most of his campaign criticism at Mr. Biden, perceiving him as his likeliest — and probably toughest — opponent in the general election. He’s gone to considerable lengths to take him out early during the Democratic primary, openly questioning his fitness for office.          “I think he’s the weakest mentally, and I like running against people that are weak mentally,” the president said of Mr. Biden last summer.          Democrats are using the president’s effort to investigate the Bidens in Ukraine as their primary argument for impeachment, accusing the president of seeking foreign help in interfering in a U.S. election. Mr. Biden is, for now, still the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.          At the time of the phone call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine.          “I think we have to stay focused as far as the public is concerned on the fact that the president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday.          Mrs. Pelosi also suggested that Russia played a role in the saga.          “It is wrong for any foreign government to interfere in our elections and here you have the president of the United States asking for that,” she said without elaborating. “I think Russia has a hand in this, by the way.”          The White House ended the week with Mr. Trump declaring “we’re at war” with the Democrats. The president and his allies were also questioning the motives of the unnamed government whistleblower, who’s reportedly a CIA officer.          Mr. Trump last week also suggested he could go to court to stop the Democrats.          “There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts,” Mr. Trump said.          Even some Republicans close to the White House say impeachment is a real concern.          “I think there’s a good chance of impeachment,” said one administration ally. “Will he be removed [by the Senate]? No. Will he even care? I think he thinks it would be one more big reality TV moment, and he’s the star of it.”\n",

      "How Trump Lost the Impeachment Narrative\n",
      "Yesterday, more than 30 House Republicans stormed the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in the basement of the Capitol, cellphones in hand, where a closed-door hearing was taking place as part of the impeachment inquiry. This flouting of strict rules governing electronics use in the sensitive space alarmed national-security experts.          The chaotic image made for a bizarre contrast to how other Republicans had discussed issues surrounding impeachment yesterday alone. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked to confirm that he told Trump his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “innocent,” as the president claimed, McConnell bluntly denied that they’d even spoken about the topic. Later, when reporters asked Trump ally Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina whether the White House needed to do a “better job” of messaging on impeachment, he simply answered: “Yes.” (The whiplash continued this morning, when Graham announced that he and McConnell would introduce a resolution condemning the probe.)          The messaging disarray began to manifest on September 25, when the White House released a summary of Trump’s call with Zelensky—the centerpiece of the whistle-blower complaint. That day was an opportunity for the Trump administration to mold the controversy that was sure to ensue over the call’s contents.          In the past, the administration had made the most of such opportunities: On March 24, for example, when Attorney General William Barr issued his four-page summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, he set the tone for how the years-long saga would be perceived. The report, Barr told the country, revealed “no collusion” and “no obstruction”—phrasing that immediately infiltrated cable-news chyrons and Trump’s Twitter feed.          It didn’t matter that, upon its release, the report proved far more damning than the attorney general’s cursory summation had suggested. Barr’s insistence on speaking for the report—rather than letting the report speak for itself—may have been one of the reasons Trump avoided impeachment in the spring. But in the case of his call with Zelensky, Trump failed to follow his attorney general’s blueprint: When the White House released the summary of the call, there was no authority figure like Barr out front reframing the narrative. There were no early talking points for Republican lawmakers to parrot.          White House attempts to reshape public impressions of the scandal have backfired. Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s acting chief of staff, made a rare appearance in the White House press briefing room last week and fielded questions about Ukraine, but he only helped confuse matters. One reason an aid package to Ukraine was held up, Mulvaney said, was because Trump wanted the country to open an investigation into the 2016 election that could help him politically. Mulvaney later tried to walk back what sounded precisely like a quid pro quo. Trump, who in recent weeks has considered firing Mulvaney, “wasn’t pleased,” a person close to the president told us, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss Trump’s views about his staff’s performance. “The Mulvaney thing hurt us. You don’t have to be a genius to figure that out.”\n",

Joe Biden, the only 2020 candidate name-checked in the articles of impeachment, echoed other Dremocrats and cast today as “a solemn moment for our country”          Cory Booker, who along with his 2020 competitors Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, will be participating in the Senate trial on whether to convict Trump, similarly said: “Today is a sad moment for our country.”          Amy Klobuchar, yet another Senator in the 2020 race said “the House is fulfilling their constitutional obligation”.          Meanwhile, Tulsi Gabbard, the only House member to vote “present” said she was “standing in the center”.          “After doing my due diligence in reviewing the 658-page impeachment report, I came to the conclusion that I could not in good conscience vote either yes or no,” she said.

      "Opinion | Will any Republicans show respect for the Constitution?\n",
      "Some representatives are exhibiting courage, including several Democrats in swing districts who have announced they will vote for impeachment even at the risk of losing their seats. “There are some decisions in life that have to be made based on what you know in your bones is right,” wrote Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) in an op-ed published Monday. A few Republicans, such as Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.), have at least acknowledged that Mr. Trump’s actions toward Ukraine were improper, while questioning whether they justify removal from office.          Yet many Republicans appear intent on refusing to engage seriously with the articles of impeachment and the evidence behind them. The bald declaration by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) — “I’m not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here” — appears to apply to a number in his party, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has pledged to coordinate closely with the White House on a trial whose outcome — acquittal — he has already declared. He and his caucus should consider the damage they are doing to the Constitution for the sake of political expediency.          We have argued that the evidence gathered by the House justifies the impeachment of Mr. Trump for seeking to force Ukraine to announce politicized investigations of Joe Biden and the 2016 U.S. election, and for obstructing Congress’s investigation. But the speed of the inquiry — Democrats, too, have been overly eager to dispose of the matter — and the White House’s obstruction have left important questions unanswered, and a probably persuadable part of the public unconvinced.          The uncertainty has been compounded by the implacable refusal of Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee to address the established facts of the months-long pressure campaign conducted by Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Instead, they have offered spurious complaints about process and manifestly false alternative narratives — including the Russian-concocted allegation that Ukraine and not Russia intervened in the 2016 election.          We can hope that more rational Republican voices will be heard during the House floor debate. But more likely it will be up to Senate Republicans to ensure that Mr. Trump is fully and fairly judged. They can do so by rejecting the rushed trial Mr. McConnell appears to be contemplating and supporting the summoning of key witnesses whose testimony has been missing.          In a letter to Mr. McConnell on Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) proposed four: acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; former national security adviser John Bolton; Robert Blair, an adviser to Mr. Mulvaney; and Michael Duffey, an official at the Office of Management and Budget. Their testimony might not change the outcome of a trial, but it would at least offer the assurance that the allegations against Mr. Trump had been fully explored.          Republicans as well as Democrats must invest the impeachment process with the gravity it should have as the ultimate constitutional check on presidential abuses. The alternative is to open the way for Mr. Trump to abuse his office with impunity.\n",

      "Re “House Hearings Roll On, but Many Tune Out” (front page, Nov. 18):          Thank you for reporting on how so many Americans did not bother to listen to the impeachment proceedings last week. It helps to answer a question that was nagging at me all weekend: How on earth could anyone listen to the words of George Kent, William Taylor and Marie Yovanovitch and still not question the ethics and morality of our current president?          Impeachment has invaded every cell in my body. Physically it has caused rashes and fatigue. Mentally it has left me saddened and anxious, dizzy at times, and desperate for relief. Even Valium could not overcome impeachment’s toxicity. Even when conversations never touch impeachment, it remains the elephant in the room.          So the monster has triumphed. Au revoir to cable news. Sayonara to talk radio. Farewell to the written media. Hello to ESPN, western movies, “ S ay Yes to the Dress.” You are my haven now. For the sake of all Americans, censure the guy and move on.          We Americans had the opportunity last week to hear from three stellar Foreign Service professionals. Their love for this country is unquestionable, and the dignity with which they serve us is admirable.\n",

      "Impeachment in the hall of mirrors: This isn't about Democrats vs. Republicans. It's about whether our democratic institutions have any mojo left\n",
      "With startling suddenness, the political and moral climate in Washington has shifted over the past few weeks. President Trump now faces the imminent threat of impeachment, apparently over a single blatant act of extortion, even though Democrats had previously decided it wasn’t worth trying to hold him to account for an extensive list of offenses. Why in God’s name is this happening now?          I’m not sure the current conflict over impeachment can usefully be described as Democrats versus Republicans, or as Donald Trump and his supporters against the “resistance.” Those terms are just vague signifiers standing in for other things. The core issue here is much larger than partisan conflict, or the fate of one especially disastrous president. It’s about competing groups who don’t even perceive the same reality, and about whether the institutions of democracy — which everyone involved loudly claims to believe in — are strong enough to withstand their most serious challenge in at least 150 years. No one knows the answer, and every aspect of this crisis is overloaded with historical irony.          Both political parties, as I see it, are being swept along by currents they only partly understand. Democrats were exceedingly reluctant to impeach, fearing the unpredictable political consequences, but now feel they have no choice. Republicans, as is increasingly obvious, say different things about Trump in public than in private, but also believe they have no choice but to ride his raft over the waterfall.          Beneath those labels, we have two sharply opposed political and philosophical visions — or perhaps competing fantasies — and the more clearly we can understand the nature and meaning of their collision, the better. On one side we have the institutionalists, who believe that the U.S. Constitution and its considered separation of powers, although embattled, remain strong enough to defeat a would-be strongman’s authoritarian power grab. This describes most Democrats (but not quite all), along with a few “concerned” Republicans and NeverTrumper renegades, nearly everyone in the upper echelons of mainstream media, and a large majority of educated, “elite” Americans in metropolitan areas.          On the other we have the radical reactionaries (and their compliant fellow travelers) who have spent decades eating away from within at those supposedly democratic institutions and the state they support. They now believe they have rotted the timbers and compromised the entire structure; the final collapse is almost here and their victory is all but certain. This comprises various overlapping or competing currents on the far right or mainstream right, many of whom would not state their agenda anywhere near that clearly: The Koch-funded libertarians and tax-cutters and “small government” enthusiasts, the Christian nationalists and white nationalists and anti-immigration hardliners, the Fox News yahoos and “America First” paleoconservatives and “unitary executive” neocons and a hundred different gradations or intermarriages of all the above.          Those forces have operated within the Republican Party for many years, needless to say — taken together, they pretty much are the contemporary Republican Party. Since the Reagan era, Republican elites have operated on the arrogant assumption that they could manage or massage those discordant, corrosive anti-institutional factions into some approximation of a governing coalition. They believed they could use gerrymandering and vote suppression and dog-whistle racism and “originalist” judges and anti-government gaslighting and culture-war propaganda to seize and hold power, while still claiming to support constitutional democracy.          Republicans’ increasingly paradoxical relationship to power made them terrible at government — see also: Bush, George W., administration of — and Donald Trump’s ascendancy made clear that the entire project was incoherent nonsense. It’s less true to say that Trump conquered the Republican Party than to say that the party surrendered without a fight, indeed almost with a sigh of gratitude, and has become fully subservient to his incoherent, whimsical agenda.          Even a few years ago, Bill Barr, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Pompeo would have described themselves as mainstream conservatives, committed to “national security” and the rule of law; now they are agents of anarcho-fascism, chasing moonbat conspiracy theories around the globe and eagerly working to overthrow the “Deep State.”          So here we stand, at an extraordinary historical precipice: Will the institutions of democracy hold, built as they were on the deeply contradictory foundations laid down by a bunch of 18th-century agrarian elitists with big ideas? Or have they been so thoroughly mocked, undermined and termite-munched that they will crumble away before a third-rate Mussolini cosplayer who can’t spell and believes emails can be “acid-washed”? At the moment, there’s no way to know which of those visions is closer to reality, or which will prevail — not just in the impeachment battle but in the longer-term struggle for the future.          Will the federal courts, to cite an obvious, present-tense example, enforce subpoenas issued by Adam Schiff or Elijah Cummings on the Trump White House? And when the latter refuses to comply, as it surely will, how will the Supreme Court — which the radical reactionaries have fought long and hard to capture — decide the matter? Does Chief Justice John Roberts, on balance, agree with Trump’s conclusion that Article II of the Constitution allows him to do whatever he wants? (I am confident that Attorney General Barr can and will phrase that argument more artfully.)          My Salon colleague Amanda Marcotte has tweeted several times that House Democrats should translate their institutional power into forceful action, perhaps by ordering the U.S. Capitol Police to arrest Barr or Pompeo for contempt of Congress. She knows perfectly well that won’t happen; Congress hasn’t tried to exercise its hypothetical police powers over the executive branch since the 1920s. But even the fact that such a scenario is inconceivable is evidence of how far our institutions have decayed since the Watergate era, when Congress and the courts forced a corrupt president to resign rather than face the humiliation of forcible removal. Is that inconceivable too? We don’t know yet, but are likely to find out soon.          As for the historical irony I mentioned earlier, that can be almost perfectly summarized in the upside-down fact that suddenly Democrats have cast themselves as defenders of the FBI, the CIA and other arms of the national security state, while Republicans are the skeptics, interrogators and investigators. For those of us who retain some vague historical awareness of COINTELPRO and the Chile coup of 1973 and the Church Committee report of 1976 — so deep in the forgotten past that its chairman was a Democratic senator from Idaho — this can only seem like a bad plot twist in a dystopian novel.          Just this weekend, we saw Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, until recently a standard-issue conservative Republican, tell Chuck Todd of “Meet the Press” that he “absolutely” did not trust the FBI or CIA and “didn’t trust them back then” either, apparently meaning before the Trump campaign and the 2016 election. One expected Johnson to say next that of course we had always been at war with Eastasia, and any suggestion to the contrary was ludicrous.          It would be false to claim that both parties are equally to blame for the institutional crisis that now has democracy teetering above the abyss. But each has contributed in its own way. Republicans have waged a ferocious, mendacious and profoundly hypocritical assault on American institutions, while pretending to be more patriotic than everyone else, while Democrats have triangulated and compromised their way into a pattern of partial accommodation and half-hearted resistance.          Democrats embraced the demolition of the welfare state, the deregulation of financial markets and the creation of the prison-industrial complex. They abandoned any pretense of a class-based economic critique, largely supported interventionist foreign policy, and forged alliances with a rising class of wealthy donors on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley.          It’s true that Democrats defended the institutions of democracy in certain areas that affected their core constituencies, especially around civil rights and environmental regulation. But they did little or nothing to resist the vast explosion of economic inequality or the rapid expansion of the post-9/11 security state, twin developments that hardened anti-government cynicism among the bottom 80 or 90 percent of the population, irrespective of supposed ideology or partisan affiliation.          Now Trump’s blatant gangster act with the Ukrainian president has abruptly stirred House Democrats into action after nine months of dithering, and the question I asked at the outset still applies: Why this, and why now? This is where I think both sides inhabit fantasy worlds, and reality lies somewhere in between them. Our democratic institutions are in serious decline, and there will be no redemptive White House perp-walk. But the dime-store fascist coup plotted by Donald Trump and his posse of ludicrous amigos won’t work either. Our crisis is long-term, and no melodramatic climax is in sight.          On one hand, the Ukraine scandal perfectly symbolizes the pattern of corruption and disruption, and the gleeful willingness to ignore both political norms and the rule of law, that have been evident throughout the Trump presidency (and indeed in every phase of Donald Trump’s career). It’s also a convenient fit for the Democratic Party of 2019: Trump’s conduct violated national-security orthodoxy in a way that turned the center-right House freshmen who’ve been dubbed the “CIA Democrats” — with whom Speaker Nancy Pelosi is closely aligned — sharply in favor of impeachment for the first time.          Don’t get me wrong: Impeachment is warranted for a long list of reasons, even if it’s best understood as an episode in the 2020 presidential campaign. But both sides are wandering through a hall of mirrors. Democrats sanctimoniously present themselves as the party of constitutional democracy — in support of the clandestine intelligence agencies and an arcane overseas proxy war no actual citizens understand, let aloe voted for. Republicans are breaking new ground, meanwhile, as the only fascist party in history to position themselves as enemies (and victims) of the police state. I don’t know who ends up winning this confrontation, but both sides are playing to lose.\n",

      "Iran announces arrests over downing of Ukrainian plane\n",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran’s judiciary said Tuesday arrests have been made over the accidental shootdown of a Ukrainian passenger plane that killed all 176 people on board just after takeoff from Tehran.          The announcement came shortly after Iran’s president called for a special court to be set up to probe the downing last week of the plane by Iranian forces.          Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili was quoted by Iranian state media saying that “extensive investigations have taken place and some individuals are arrested. He did not say how many individuals have been detained or name them.          Iran, which initially dismissed allegations that a missile had brought down the jetliner, acknowledged - three days after Wednesday’s downing and in the face of mounting evidence - that its Revolutionary Guard had shot down the Ukrainian plane by mistake.          “The judiciary should form a special court with a ranking judge and dozens of experts,” President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech televised in Iran on Tuesday. “This is not an ordinary case. The entire the world will be watching this court.”          Rouhani called the incident “a painful and unforgivable” mistake and promised that his administration would pursue the case “by all means.”          “The responsibility falls on more than just one person,” he said, adding that those found culpable “should be punished.”          “There are others, too, and I want that this issue is expressed honestly,” he said, without elaborating.          Rouhani called the government’s admission that Iranian forces shot down the plane the “first good step”.          The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians - including many Iranians with dual citizenship - and 11 Ukrainians, according to officials. There were several children among the passengers, including an infant.          Iran shot down the plane when it was bracing for possible U.S. retaliation for a ballistic missile attack on two military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq. No one was hurt in that attack, which was carried out to avenge the stunning killing of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in an American airstrike in Baghdad.          The shootdown and the lack of transparency around it has reignited anger in Iran at the country’s leadership, with protesters taking to the streets in past days. Online videos appeared to show security forces firing live ammunition and tear gas to disperse protests in the streets.\n",

      "Trump warns Iran: ‘Do not kill your protesters’\n",
      "Amid growing protests and anger in the streets of Iran, President Trump on Sunday delivered a blunt warning to the government in Tehran.          “To the leaders of Iran - DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS,” Mr. Trump said in a Sunday morning Twitter post. “Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!”          Protests across Iran grew on Sunday after the Iranian government was forced to admit that it accidentally shot down a Ukrainian airliner last week, killing all 176 people abroad and sparking outrage around the world. The shootdown came just after Iran launched ballistic missiles at U.S. military bases in Iraq, bringing Washington and Tehran to the brink of all-out war.          The demonstrations across Iran highlight how anger inside the country is now turning on the Iranian government itself. Leaders in Tehran first denied that they were responsible for the downing of the plane only to reverse course as the truth became clear.          “They are lying that our enemy is America, our enemy is right here,” a group of Iranian protesters shouted on Sunday during a demonstration in Tehran, according to Reuters.          Demonstrators also reportedly chanted “Death to the dictator,” referring to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.          Iranian leaders have apologized for the mistake and vowed that those responsible will be prosecuted.          Trump administration officials on Sunday reiterated that they’re willing to sit down with the Iranian government and negotiate for a permanent end to the country’s nuclear weapons program. At the same time, U.S. officials tried to capitalize on the growing protests and drive a wedge between the government in Tehran and Iranian citizens.          “They want the same things that most people around the world want. They want prosperity,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper told CBS’ “Face the Nation” program on Sunday. “They want the ability to live their lives, to raise their children. And we do support those same aspirations for people wherever they are. I just think you see a very corrupt regime that the Iranian people are finally standing up and trying to hold them accountable.”\n",

      "State Department Officially Calls Iran’s Forced Sex Change Surgeries ‘Confirmation’\n",
      "A report issued Thursday by the Department of State repeatedly refers to sex reassignment surgery in Iran as “gender-confirmation surgery.”          Speaking at the release of the State Department’s annual human rights report, Secretary of State John Kerry said of the designation that “There is nothing sanctimonious in this,” emphasizing the need for “humility” in the face of the U.S.’ own racial inequality. The State Department did not respond to a request for clarification by The Daily Caller News Foundation.          Iran has a well-documented record of coercing gay and lesbian people into having the gender reassignment surgery, that is, disrupting rather than “confirming” the gender identity of hundreds per year. Since homosexuality can be punishable by death in Iran, known homosexual men tend to accept the government-subsidized surgery to become women, and vice versa. (RELATED: World’s Most Infamous Hookup App Catches On In Islamist Iran)          The State Department’s new report covers the state of human rights in every country in the world. The chapter on Iran is some 16,000 words long, documenting restrictions such as lack of freedom for religious and political expression; unlawful detention, torture and killing; and “discrimination and violence against women, ethnic and religious minorities.”          Section 6 is labeled “Discrimination, Societal Abuses, and Trafficking in Persons,” and includes a sub-section on the condition of LGBT people. That section states that Iranian law “defines transgender persons as mentally ill,” and that Iran therefore loans candidates for surgery up to $2,030 to undergo the operation.          By referring to the surgeries as “gender confirmation,” rather than the much more widespread and morally neutral “sex reassignment surgery,” the State Department seems to be siding with the Iranian government’s false “cure” for homosexuality. (RELATED: You Can’t Drink Legally In Iran, But The Government Will Still Send You To Rehab)          A 2014 report by the BBC profiled gay and lesbian people from Iran, several of whom were forced to undergo sex reassignment surgery. One person, born male, felt “physically damaged” after a doctor recommended hormone therapy and then surgery to become a woman.          The State Department’s human rights report also comes just days before the June 30 deadline for a finalized nuclear deal with Iran.

      "The Iranian regime: Evil from the top down\n",
      "The Iranian regime is, currently, high among the most trouble-making regimes of the world if not the highest in terms of pure nuisance value.          It sabotaged, contrary to the accepted diplomatic norms, a tanker carrying oil to Japan on the very same day that Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was meeting Ayatollah Khamenei; it sent its own oil-tanker to Syria in violation of the EU sanctions and then seized a British oil-tanker at the direct order of the ayatollah in an illegal and destabilizing behavior in alleged retaliation at Gibraltar’s legal detention of its oil bound for Syria.          When its IRGC offensive drone was recently destroyed by the United States, it denied that it ever had any drone. Iran’s foreign minister blatantly criticized a BBC interviewer who told him that Iran gave millions of dollars to Hezbollah every year by saying “Who says that Iran gives money to Hezbollah?”          Apparently, he had forgotten his own presence with that cynical smile on his face in a meeting where the terrorist leader of Hezbollah threatened the West that they could by no means cut the organization’s funds through sanctions of bank transactions — “because we received cash money from Iran for everything.”          One can produce an endless list of such behavior by the Iran regime which has proved, beyond doubt, its shameless mastery of sheer lies and deceitful acts. Surely, there can no longer be any question remaining as to why think of resolving any matter with such a regime through talks and dialogue?          How could the world’s democracies ever trust a government which,for four decades, has demonstrated that it recognizes only its own right to violate others’ rights and freedoms — most obviously those of its own citizens? What forces us to do so?          People like Jack Straw who dedicated his political career to diplomatic dialogue once encouraged fellow citizens to appease and rescue the mullahs at a time of their severe international isolation, but even he must now, despite his sincerity, recognize the impossibility of being able to approach the mullahs of Iran in a positive and constructive manner.          However, some may argue that, nuisance though they may be, we must be careful with a very important Middle East country and we are not going to remove them anyway. But that is exactly where they are mistaken.          One can never convert an evil nuisance through being careful and sending a signal that one is frightened by its threats. Instead, one should highlight, as one better understands the language of force and power, one is not taking those threats seriously.          Iran does have an Achilles Heel. That is a well-organized resistance movement — the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), led by the courageous and constructive Maryam Rajavi.          This movement has a large network of supporters in exile who in their great numbers echo the voice of the voiceless Iranian people inside the country — those who have been brutally oppressed by the mullahs for four decades, as well as a sizeable support base that has become more discernable in light of the regime’s more public acknowledgement in recent months.          Iran’s regime was, initially, successful in demonizing the NCRI to make sure that it would not receive any attack from that side. They had it deemed ‘a terrorist organization’ but history has largely answered that. The NCRI’s erstwhile forebearers, the MEK, has proven to be responsible and viable.          Sadly, our politicians and media have been fooled and duped for long enough to take the demonization seriously and even to echo it. But now it is time to stop echoing the mullahs, not least within the United Kingdom.          France, Austria and the United States, to name but three nations, have openly welcomed the constructive Maryam Rajavi and given shelter to her followers. But, shamefully, the United Kingdom has been tardy, failing even to acknowledge the mullahs 30,000 pogrom of 1988.          We must confront our outdated and ill-informed prejudice and begin to listen to Maryam Rajavi and her brilliant super-democratic 10-point plan for future Iran; we must recognize the Iranian people’s legitimate right for regime-change and, bluntly, move our misinformed prejudice into the 21st century. The NCRI wants nothing more from us.          On Saturday, Maryam Rajavi’s supporters marched in the streets of London in big numbers after they did so in Brussels, Washington, Berlin and Stockholm. Our politicians and media should grasp the opportunity to stand with them. Let those of us, who value our freedom, support such events and listen carefully to the message. It’s time to listen to the Iranian people and the opposition. A different Iran is not unthinkable. The Iranians have made up their mind to bring about change. The question is on whose side we want to be?     • Lord Maginnis of Drumglassis a prominent member of the British Committee for Iran Freedom and member of the U.K. House of Lords\n",

      "Pentagon vice chairman: Navy will respond with force to Iran’s harassment if necessary\n",
      "The Pentagon’s top brass on Wednesday gave a strong endorsement to President Trump’s tweet ordering the Navy to “shoot down and destroy” Iranian boats harassing U.S. vessels in the Persian Gulf.          Air Force Gen. John Hyten, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Pentagon briefing Wednesday he appreciated Mr. Trump’s message and said the president’s intention was to emphasize that any warship has the inherent right of self-defense.          “I like that the president warned an adversary. That’s what he’s doing: He’s providing a warning,” Gen. Hyten said.          SEE ALSO: Mike Pompeo: Iran must be held accountable for military satellite launch          “If you want to go down that path, we will come and we will come large. So don’t go down that path,” Gen. Hyten added. “We understand that direction and every commander deployed has the ability to execute.”          Gen. Hyten and Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist repeatedly declined to answer whether Mr. Trump’s tweet, which came days after video showing nearly a dozen Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps speedboats weaving dangerously around a U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships in the Persian Gulf, was being formalized as an actual order changing the rules of engagement with the IRGC.          Mr. Norquist also described the president’s tweet a warning, and suggested it gave greater force to the authority U.S. commanders already have in the escalating confrontation with Iran.          SEE ALSO: New rules of engagement: Trump orders U.S. Navy to ‘destroy’ harassing Iranian gunboats          “The president issued a warning to the Iranians,” Norquist said. “What he was emphasizing is all of our ships retain the right of self-defense and people need to be very careful in their interactions to understand the inherent right of self-defense.”          In the most recent incident last week, an IRGC vessel appeared to come within 10 yards of an American ship. A trained U.S. commander can tell the difference between hostile and non-hostile actions from another vessel, Gen. Hyten said Wednesday.          “If you come across and you’re at a safe distance and you’re waving — that’s one thing. If you have a gun and you point it at me, that’s another thing,” he said. “We know what that line is [and] we will respond. I think the president’s message was crystal clear.”\n",

      "Trump doubles down on threat to Iranian cultural sites\n",
      "Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.          President Donald Trump dug in Sunday night on his threat to attack Iranian cultural sites if it should retaliate for the U.S. killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, one of Iran's top military and intelligence officials.          Speaking aboard Air Force One on his return to Washington D.C. Sunday from a holiday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump said: \"They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites. It doesn’t work that way.\"          Trump was responding to backlash over the threat he made via Twitter on Saturday to attack 52 targets if Iran retaliates and his claim in a tweet that those targets would be \"at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture,\" according to a pool report.          Asked about fears Iran might retaliate, the president told reporters: \"If it happens it happens. If they do anything there will be major retaliation.\"          Trump told reporters the U.S. had surveillance on Soleimani going back 18 months. \"He was leading his country down a very bad dangerous path,\" Trump said.          Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called the suggestion that the U.S. military would target cultural sites a \"war crime\" in his own Twitter response.          Protocol I of the Geneva Convention prohibits the targeting of \"historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples,\" while also prohibiting making such sites the \"object of reprisals.\"          But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo batted down the idea that the U.S. would violate the law with any strikes. \"The American people should know that we have prepared for this, that we are ready, that our responses are lawful, and that the president will take every action necessary to respond should Iran decide to escalate,\" Pompeo told Chuck Todd on \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday.          The president's rhetoric comes despite backlash over his threat to cultural sites, including from some in his own party. \"We shouldn't be attacking cultural sites. And I don't see our military planners suggesting or identifying sites to hit,\" Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, said on MSNBC Sunday night.          \"And we should be focused on targeting the folks that are involved in conducting terrorism, the folks that are putting down their own people,\" Hurd added.          House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is this week expected to introduce and vote on a War Powers Resolution to limit the President’s military actions regarding Iran.          Trump on Sunday night also sounded a note of defiance over the news that Iraq's Parliament voted to expel U.S. troops from the country. He said military personnel would not leave unless Iraq pays the U.S. back for an air base there.          \"We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that’s there. It cost billions of dollars to build. Long before my time,\" Trump said. \"We’re not leaving unless they pay us back for it.\"          The president went on to say that if Iraq forces the U.S. military presence out of Iraq, \"we will charge them sanctions like they’ve never seen before ever. It'll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.\"          \"If there’s any hostility, that they do anything we think is inappropriate, we are going to put sanctions on Iraq, very big sanctions on Iraq,\" Trump said.          Iraq's prime minister has scheduled a meeting with the U.S. ambassador for Monday to discuss the U.S. role in Iraq, according to two officials familiar with the planning.          The officials say Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi is expected to tell Ambassador Matthew Tueller that U.S. troops will have to leave the country, and he is expected to ask for a timeline.\n",

      "Newly Declassified Documents Confirm U.S. Backed 1953 Coup in Iran Over Oil Contracts\n",
      "This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.          JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, of course, oil has always been at the center of Western policy toward Iran. And you’ve written about some recently released documents that date back to the 1953 coup of the—          JUAN GONZÁLEZ: —organized by the CIA against the democratically elected leader of Iran.          JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Could you talk about that and also why it’s taken so long for these latest documents to be released?          ERVAND ABRAHAMIAN: Well, as you say, it’s so long ago. And actually, according to rules—there’s a 30-year rule, so documents that are—could be released are. It’s taken three decades of beyond that before the State Department released these. It’s like pulling teeth out of someone. And the reason, when you look at it, is that—well, there are two reasons. One is that what the documents show is actually the importance of oil in the coup. The conventional wisdom is, oh, it was all the Cold War scare, communism. But here you see, actually, very occasionally, when Eisenhower intervenes in a discussion, it’s about question of oil contracts and so on and how nationalization would disrupt the whole international framework and would be a threat to U.S. interests, oil interests, elsewhere.          But another, I think, reason they have been so reluctant to publish these documents is that it shows how involved the U.S. Embassy was, the ambassador, in internal Iranian affairs. It’s like looking at an imperial power in a semi-colonial situation. The ambassador acts basically like a viceroy, involved in many different internal policy. He often says, “Oh, of course, it’s not my business to be involved in internal policy,” but then he goes ahead and, in fact, does get involved.          And the astounding discovery, I was surprised, is how CIA was involved in the elections that were held in 1952 during the Mosaddegh period. And what their strategy was to undermine Mosaddegh through Parliament. And a lot of money went into basically getting what the CIA thought would be their favorable candidates elected. And this we didn’t know before. But then you would see also that when they talk about, well, we need to get rid of Mosaddegh, they have 18 candidates the U.S. discusses who is suitable to have the next—          AMY GOODMAN: But when you talk about what wasn’t known and what was, you’re a professor, but most people don’t even know what was known, was the deep U.S.-CIA involvement—          AMY GOODMAN: —with Allen Dulles, the brother of John Foster Dulles—Allen Dulles, head of the CIA—          AMY GOODMAN: —John Foster Dulles, secretary of state—who, together—and then, of course, there’s Eisenhower—          AMY GOODMAN: —and others who engineer this coup, using Teddy Roosevelt’s grandson, Kermit Roosevelt—          AMY GOODMAN: —as the bag guy, the guy who comes with bags of money and actually overthrows Mohammad Mosaddegh, the democratically elected leader.          ERVAND ABRAHAMIAN: Yeah. But, actually, even there, what we—the conventional wisdom was you had the Truman administration, and then, when Eisenhower came in, the machinery is put for the coup, and it was the Eisenhower administration, with Kermit Roosevelt and Dulles, doing it. What these documents show, which is astounding, before Eisenhower, under the Truman administration, there was actually a deep state. And the deep state in the CIA were exactly Dulles and Kermit Roosevelt. They were in charge of the Iran desk in the CIA, long—from 1951, long before the Eisenhower. So they were pushing for real action in Iran before Eisenhower came in. And they were working very closely with the British before the Eisenhower administration.          AMY GOODMAN: And they tried to get Kermit Roosevelt to do the same thing the next year, in 1954, in Guatemala. He refused, but they did it anyway and overthrew the democratically elected leader in Guatemala, Árbenz.          AMY GOODMAN: And when we hear discussions today about Russia interfering with our elections, I think it’s very important for people to understand U.S. history.          AMY GOODMAN: Let me ask you a last question about The New York Times last month naming the so-called dark prince to run the Iran operations, signaling a tougher stance, The New York Times reporting Michael D’Andrea now running the CIA’s Iran operations. He oversaw the hunt for Osama bin Laden, American drone strike campaign, that kills thousands of Islamist militants and hundreds of civilians. Your thoughts when you heard this and the anger of the Trump administration of revealing his name?          ERVAND ABRAHAMIAN: I don’t know the politics of that, really. I think, again, they’re very confused about what to do with Iran. And this is a reflection of that.          JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I’m just wondering if, in the documents—we’ve got about 30 seconds—you can across the name of Donald Wilhelm at all, who was a CIA guy who went to Iran after, after the overthrow of Mosaddegh, and who was actually the mayor’s—Mayor Bill de Blasio’s uncle?          ERVAND ABRAHAMIAN: Yeah, he actually co-ghostwrote the shah’s memoirs.          ERVAND ABRAHAMIAN: It would be interesting to know something about—more about the family history. I don’t think there would be much political discussions between this part of the family and that part. He was kind of a CIA academic.          AMY GOODMAN: Well, we will leave it there. Ervand Abrahamian, thanks so much for being with us, retired professor of history at Baruch College, City University of New York.\n",

      "Majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of Iran, feel less safe: POLL\n",
      "WATCH: The White House is facing new questions about the intelligence behind the strike on Iran’s top commander and a new ABC News/Ipsos poll shows over half the country disapproves of how Trump is handling Iran.          WATCH: The White House is facing new questions about the intelligence behind the strike on Iran’s top commander and a new ABC News/Ipsos poll shows over half the country disapproves of how Trump is handling Iran.          In a week dominated by increased tension with Iran and speculation over when impeachment articles would be delivered to the U.S. Senate, a majority of Americans said they disapprove of President Trump's handling of the situation with Iran and feel less safe, according to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll.          But when it comes to a key conflict at home, impeachment, attitudes are more mixed, with Americans split in their assessment of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's motivations for delaying the transmittal of the articles of impeachment.          The poll, conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News, using Ipsos' Knowledge Panel, asked Americans about their attitudes on two unfolding challenges for the Trump presidency -- escalating tensions with Iran and the impending impeachment trial in the Senate.          Overall attitudes about Trump and the consequences of his actions against Iran largely were driven by Independents, a critical target for both parties in electoral politics. The poll showed a majority of Independents, 57%, and all U.S. adults, 56%, disapproving of Trump's handling of the situation with Iran, with 43% of both Independents and U.S. adults approving.          Respondents also were asked about the fallout of the strike against Qassem Soleimani, the second-most-important official in Iran's government behind Ayatollah Khamenei, which marked a major escalation in months of tension between the U.S. and Iran, which launched retaliatory missile strikes on American bases in Iraq.          In the aftermath of the U.S. strike, only 28% of Independents, and 25% of Americans, said they felt more safe, while just over half, 51% of Independents and 52% of U.S. adults, said they felt less safe.          When it comes to attitudes on the conflict with Iran, partisanship drives opinions. An overwhelming 87% of Republicans approved of Trump's handling of Iran, and 54% say they feel safer. Among Democrats, 90% disapproved and 82% felt less safe.          Still, when asked about concerns over the possibility of the United States getting involved in a full-scale war with Iran, Democrats are more united in expressing concern than Republicans.          A net total of 94% of Democrats, and 52% of Republicans, are either very concerned or somewhat concerned about the possibility of entering into another war in the Middle East, compared with 6% of Democrats and 48% of Republicans who said they were not so concerned or not concerned at all.          Independents once again tracked the country's positions as a whole, with 72% of Independents and 73% of Americans saying they're concerned about a new war, and 28% of Independents and 27% of U.S. adults dismissing such concerns.          Attitudes on the homefront's chief political conflict, impeachment, also are driven by partisanship, with 66% of Democrats and 10% of Republicans maintaining that Pelosi and Democrats were abiding by a constitutional duty to ensure a full and deliberate trial in the Senate, while 81% of Republicans and 8% of Democrats stood by the statement that not immediately transmitting the articles showed that allegations against Trump are not serious and that the Democrats are playing partisan politics.          However, when it comes to gauging Pelosi's motivations around delaying the transmittal of the articles, independents were splintered, and their division drove overall attitudes. Identical percentages, 39%, of Independents and Americans each agree that Pelosi, by withholding the articles, was fulfilling a constitutional duty. But a similar number of Independents, 36%, and U.S. adults, 37%, agreed with the sentiment that the speaker and her party were playing politics by delaying the articles' transmission.          After three weeks of waiting and recent pressure from within her own party, the Democratic leader announced on Friday she planned to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate this coming week.          This ABC News/Ipsos poll was conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs‘ KnowledgePanel® Jan. 10-11, 2020, in English and in Spanish, among a random national sample of 525 adults.

      "Trump Announces New Sanctions on Iran\n",
      "The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said on Thursday that a military strike against Iran by the United States or Saudi Arabia would result in “an all-out war.”          The latest sanctions affect the Central Bank of Iran and the National Development Fund of Iran, “the last remaining source of funds,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who joined Mr. Trump in the Oval Office.          “This is very big,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “We’ve now cut off all source of funds to Iran.”          Last year, the United States took the rare step to designate the head of the central bank, Valiollah Seif, as a global terrorist, and accused the bank of funneling money to Hezbollah.          While the Trump administration emphasized the severity of the latest sanctions, it was not clear that they would have any real impact on Iran’s behavior or do much additional damage to its economy. In addition to sanctioning Mr. Seif last year, the Treasury Department reimposed sanctions related to purchases of American dollars by the Iranian government, which had been suspended as part of an international nuclear accord.          The new sanctions to the central bank are an additional layer over what the United States has already levied, said Ryan Fayhee, a partner at Hughes Hubbard and Reed who heads the firm’s sanctions, export controls and anti-money laundering practice. The impact of the new sanctions on the development fund, Mr. Fayhee said, depends on how active or well-funded it is. If the fund has access to oil revenues, he said, the sanctions could have an impact. He said the extent of central bank interest and property in the United States is not known.\n",

      "Seven Questions That Need Answers Before Any Attack on Iran\n",
      "President George W. Bush twice sought and obtained congressional authorization to use force, once against al-Qaeda, then against Iraq. President George H.W. Bush sought and got congressional authorization to expel Iraq from Kuwait. Where’s Trump’s authorization to attack Iran? An attack on Iran would not be a police action in a failed state, like the U.S. intervention in Somalia in the early 1990s; it would not be low-risk in terms of American life and money, like President Clinton’s operations in the former Yugoslavia in the mid-1990s. An attack on Iran in defense of Saudi Arabia could—and very likely would—rapidly escalate into a big war across a range of battlefields, including cyber, all over the world. Starting such a war obviously exceeds any historic or reasonable definition of inherent presidential power. Congress must be asked for its authorization.          Armed aggression against U.S. friends and partners does not in itself demand a U.S. response. India has been a target of frequent armed aggression from Pakistan. The U.S. has not jumped in. Normally, the United States asks questions like: Can this friend handle the attack on its own? Is there, perhaps, fault on both sides? Are there non-military solutions? How important are the interests at risk?          That last question is especially important in Saudi Arabia.          As Trump often reminds his Twitter readers, the U.S. is again a net exporter of oil, and the world’s largest single producer of petroleum. Saudi Arabia’s top customer is now China. The attack on the Saudi refineries raised the price of oil, but it’s doubtful that the spike will endure—and anyway, it is not obvious that an ultra-low oil price is in the U.S. national interest. A higher oil price improves the competitiveness of North American producers and encourages oil consumers around the world to burn less of the climate-altering stuff.          What are the goals?          If the point of “locking and loading” is to impose a cost on Iran for its misconduct—well, Tehran is already paying for its misdeeds, in the form of crushing U.S. sanctions. Trump has often said his supreme goal with Iran is prevent them from acquiring a nuclear missile. If that’s the goal, then we need a new diplomatic initiative to replace the U.S.-Iran nuclear agreement that Trump cancelled.          If Trump hits Iran at the same time he is so abjectly wooing North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un it would, by contrast, only drive home the message: You people are fools not to develop a bomb of your own.          Trump is working, at most, part-time. He is neither respected nor trusted by some 60 percent of the U.S. population, one of the most consistent rejections of a president in modern American political history. His administration is a chaos of rapid staff turnover, mutual betrayal, and weirdos and incompetents at the highest level. When good people occupy senior positions, they candidly ignore the president—as in the famous story of Secretary of Defense James Mattis taking a call from an agitated Trump, listening to his orders, then hanging up the phone and telling staff: “We’re not going to do any of that.”\n",

      "America must stop helping China’s regime grow richer and more oppressive\n",
      "Suppose you had a neighbor who beat his wife, abused his children, engaged in violent crimes and routinely burgled your home. Would you invite him for Sunday brunch? Go into business with him? Share a bungalow at the beach? I don’t think so. So why are we still pretending that China is just one trade agreement away from becoming anything other than the nation-state version of the odious character I’ve described above?          Here’s an incomplete list of the nefarious activities undertaken by the ruling Communist Party of China:          Incarcerating Muslim Uighurs in “re-education” camps; colonizing Tibet; organ-harvesting from prisoners of conscience; suppressing the people of Hong Kong in violation of treaty obligations; stealing hundreds of billions of dollars of American intellectual property, including defense secrets year after year; forcing American corporations to kowtow and self-censor; proliferating nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology; pursuing exploitative and neo-imperialist policies in Asia, Africa and Latin America; and building up its military capabilities with the goal of intimidating and ultimately defeating the United States.          America’s China policy — based on engagement and conciliation — traces back to the Nixon administration. To be fair, in the midst of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, Sino-American detente brought some benefits. But there also was this: Republicans and Democrats alike believed that by helping China get richer, we’d help China to liberalize.          Economic growth, we reasoned, would birth a burgeoning bourgeoisie that would demand political power and increased freedom. Rulers would respond by giving the people what they want — slowly perhaps, but surely. Over time, China would become a responsible member of the “international community.”          It was a lovely theory, but it’s been conclusively disproven by realty. Xi Jinping is the most totalitarian Chinse ruler since Mao Zedong. And China did not become capitalist as has been widely believed. Instead, it developed a mercantilist brand of socialism, substituting state control of the means of production for state ownership of the means of production, while mandating “military-civil fusion.” I think the term is self-explanatory.          Give credit where credit is due: Unlike his predecessors, President Trump recognized the growing menace China’s rulers now pose. Mr. Trump’s National Security Strategy (NSS), written when Gen. H.R. McMaster was his national security adviser, states plainly that China is a “revisionist” power that regards the United States as its geopolitical rival, a challenge to which the United States must respond with more than hope for change.          The NSS warns that China uses “implied military threats to persuade other states to heed its political and security agenda,” and is increasingly engaging in “cyber-enabled economic warfare,” a phrase coined by Samantha Ravich, my colleague at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Cyber-enabled economic warfare implies the use of high-technology weapons to debilitate America economically in order to cripple America militarily.          Which leads us to two questions. First: Is there a moral case for continuing to intertwine our economy with China’s, for helping the regime prosper? My answer: Clearly not. Second: Would it be easy and painless to decouple the U.S. economy from China’s? My answer to that also would be no.          However, James Rickards, a longtime adviser on international economics and financial threats to the Department of Defense and intelligence community has a different answer: “So what?”          In an email conversation with me, he wrote: “What price do we put on the lives of innocent victims of state torture, murder and thought control? At some point you just have to walk away. If Apple’s earnings per share take a hit, too bad.”          Upon further reflection, he added: “Maybe it won’t be deleterious. If cutting ties means we don’t lose $300 billion per year in intellectual property theft, don’t lose jobs to slave labor, don’t enrich an atheistic Communist elite, don’t cede control of the 21st century, and don’t let China trigger a new global financial crisis, then that seems entirely positive for the U.S. economy. This does not mean we can’t do trade deals, but the deals should be bilateral and drive a hard bargain.”          Policy makers are not the only ones who should be pondering this moral/economic dilemma. Consumers, too, might want to think twice before buying products made in China. And in a New York Times op-ed last week, the American Enterprise Institute’s Danielle Pletka and Derek Scissors noted: “American financial heavyweights and pension funds have in recent years shunned fossil fuels, guns and other investments on ethical grounds. Yet when it comes to providing capital to Chinese companies — including those directly engaged in surveillance or supporting the People’s Liberation Army — many haven’t resisted investment.”          If the United States were to make clear that China’s access to American consumers and investors is now in jeopardy, might the regime change its behavior? Mr. Rickards contends that while China may appear to be “a monolithic juggernaut,” in reality it is a “fragile construct that could descend into chaos.” Do China’s rulers secretly agree? Were we to start cutting them off, we might find out.          Nevertheless, transforming hostile actors into peaceful, prosperous and cooperative neighbors is no mean feat. Consider Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba. What should be less difficult: Recognizing when policies have produced unintended and deleterious consequences, and altering course.          One strategic rule by now should be obvious: Do not enrich thine enemy. Or, to paraphrase a quote attributed to Lenin: Don’t sell your enemy the rope with which to hang you, or let him steal from you the technology for building gallows.     • Clifford D.

      "Jim Banks Urges Firing of California’s Public Pension Head over Ties to China’s ‘Thousand Talents Program’\n",
      "Representative Jim Banks (R., Ind.) sent a letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom on Wednesday urging the firing of California’s public pension chief investment officer due to his participation in Beijing’s “Thousand Talents Program.”          Yu Ben Meng — a U.S. citizen who emigrated from China at 25 to attend the University of California, Davis — assumed his role as CIO of California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) in January 2019, after first working there in 2008. CaIPERS is the largest public pension fund in the country, with over $360 billion in assets.          But Banks warned that Meng’s job deserved further scrutiny.          “We found Chinese newspaper articles that take credit for him being in the position that he’s in currently,” Banks told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo.          In between his two stints at CalPERS, Meng worked for three years, starting in 2015, as deputy CIO with China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), which oversees China’s U.S. Treasury security holdings.          A 2017 article in China’s People’s Daily asserts that Meng was then recruited to the position at SAFE by Beijing’s Thousand Talents Program, which provides funding to U.S. citizens in exchange for information. “In human life, if there is an opportunity to serve the motherland, such responsibility and honor cannot be compared to anything,” Meng told the paper.          “Governor Newsom, if it were up to me, I would fire Mr. Meng immediately,” Banks wrote in the letter. “At the least, I think a thorough investigation of Mr. Meng’s relationship to the Chinese Communist Party and a comparison of CalPERS investments in Chinese companies before and after Mr. Meng’s 2008 hiring are both warranted.”          “This is a reprehensible attack on a U.S. citizen. We fully stand behind our Chief Investment Officer who came to CalPERS with a stellar international reputation,” she said.          Banks says that financial records show billions of California pension dollars invested in Chinese holdings, a fact pointed out by secretary of state Mike Pompeo during a speech on Sunday.          “California’s pension fund . . . is invested in companies that supply the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) that puts our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines at risk,” Pompeo said.          In November, a senior FBI official admitted that the U.S. government had not been proactive in preventing “Thousand Talents” participants from impacting the American academy, after a bipartisan Senate report accused federal agencies of failing to stop the systematic exploitation of U.S. research by Beijing. The head of Harvard University’s chemistry department was charged in January with hiding his participation in the plan from officials in the Defense Department and the National Institutes of Health.\n",

      "Andrew Cuomo Thanks Chinese Government for Ventilator Donation\n",
      "During a Saturday press briefing in Albany, N.Y., Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) thanked the Chinese government for facilitating a donation of 1,000 ventilators to the Empire State via foundations set up by Alibaba founders Jack Ma and Joseph Tsai.          A digital slide displayed during the official livestream feed of Cuomo’s briefing read, “Thank you to the Chinese government and Ambassador Huang, Chinese Consul General.”          China is remarkably the repository for all of these orders — ventilators, PPE — it all goes back to China, which long-term we have to figure out why we wound up in this situation where we don’t have the manufacturing capacity in this country. I understand supply chain issues. I understand the cost of manufacturing, but it is a public health reason, as we’ve all learned the hard way,why we need the capacity in this country to do this, but anyway, it all comes back to China, so New York has been shopping in China. We’re not really China experts here international relations is not what we do on a daily basis. I’ve been to China before when I was at Secretary did a trade mission with China, so I have a basic understanding but we went to the Asia society to help us navigate China I asked the White House to help us navigate China I spoke to the ambassador and we got really good news today that the Chinese government is going to facilitate a donation of 1,000 ventilators that will come into JFK today and I want to thank Joe Tsai and Clara Tsai and Jack Ma from Alibaba, and then that’s –but I’m not stating a preference — for their donation. That’s going to be very helpful and I want to thank Ambassador Huang very much for his help in making all of this happen, because this is a big deal and it’s going to make a significant difference for us.          Via state-run news media, the Chinese government has attributed high failure rates of medical equipment produced in China to foreign suppliers of raw materials and improper use of its exports.          Coronavirus testing kits made in China had a 70 percent failure rate in Spain. Netherlands authorities recalled 600,000 defective medical masks imported from China.\n",

      "Countering China’s Technology Offensive\n",
      "Without a course correction of U.S. policy, our country will almost certainly lose this race for technological leadership.          Without a course correction of U.S. policy, our country will almost certainly lose this race for technological leadership.          NRPLUS MEMBER ARTICLE F ive years ago, the government of China launched a massive effort, supported by massive funding, to implement an ambitious master plan, Made in China 2025. Its goal is to move away from being the world’s factory of low-cost goods to becoming the world leader in the key technologies of the 21st century. The nation that leads in these technologies will lead the world economically, and likely in other ways as well.          The challenge posed by this offensive is now clear. China is already rapidly gaining on the United States and could surpass it within this decade, and perhaps even by the announced date of 2025. The question becomes: What will our nation do about it?          One of the critical technologies at stake — 5G telecommunications — is of particular concern. Despite U.S. government warnings about the security risks linked to Chinese-based 5G equipment, such equipment is being installed in almost every nook and cranny of our country’s telecom infrastructure. America’s closest allies are similarly buying up these low-cost Chinese products, even though safer Western-made alternatives are available.          Another critical technology is advanced medicines based on the latest biotech developments. China already hosts more clinical trials than America, despite our long dominance in the health-care space. China is also quickly overtaking the United States in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, autonomous vehicles, robotics, 3D printing, and other computer-related technologies.          What has been the U.S. response? We do not have a master plan, nor a strategy to concentrate on advancing the key technologies vital to economic and national security. In fact, rather than increasing government support for critical research and development (R&D) funding, we have reduced it. In the 1960s, U.S. government funding for R&D equaled 1.8 percent of GDP; now it is only 0.6 percent — a two-thirds drop.          Private funding by venture capitalists is also increasingly moving overseas, with the United States’ share of global venture capital shrinking from 84 percent in 2004 to around 50 percent in recent years. China and Europe, with stronger patent protections, have benefitted. U.S. private investments have also disturbingly shifted away from hard technologies, such as computer chips, to lower-risk commercial activities such as entertainment and hospitality.          There are a number of factors contributing to this shift in technological leadership. First, China subsidizes favored firms in key areas, such as Huawei, its leading 5G company. The United States does not. Our strongest 5G company, Qualcomm, must compete against Huawei and the Chinese government, while also contending with legal and regulatory challenges from our own government. For example, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission launched an ill-advised antitrust enforcement action against Qualcomm, shrinking the revenue that the company needs to fund its R&D.          China has also notably boosted private investment incentives by strengthening patent protections in the country. It has upgraded its patent office, repeatedly modernized its intellectual property (IP) laws, and created new IP courts trained in technology, providing fast, cheap enforcement with routine injunctions against infringers.          The United States has done none of these things. Instead, we have weakened patent protections here, creating a disincentive for innovation and investment. In 2011, Congress enacted the America Invents Act, which established an administrative Patent Trial and Appeal Board that allows wealthy corporate infringers to easily invalidate the patents of smaller inventors. Congress continued to divert money away from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, harming the agency’s ability to promote U.S. innovation. U.S. courts have also become slower and more expensive than ever. And since the Supreme Court’s 2006 eBay decision, it has become almost impossible for many patent holders to obtain an injunction to stop an infringer.          Fortunately, some in Congress are finally paying attention to this challenge. Several bipartisan bills are now pending that would help to repair our depleted innovation incentives. The Endless Frontier Act would increase R&D funding of vital technologies by $100 billion per year and put the National Science Foundation in charge of the investment. Another proposal, the STRONGER Patents Act, would increase the strength and stability in the U.S. patent system and restore injunctions against proven infringers.          Without a course correction of U.S. policy, our country will almost certainly lose this race for technological leadership. The bottom line is that modern innovation is incredibly expensive, but our progress in these areas is essentially a function of the investment we put into them. We will get the innovation and domestic production needed only if we sharply increase both public investments and private incentives. Let’s start by passing the Endless Frontier Act and the STRONGER Patents Act. The time for action has arrived.          The Honorable Paul R.

      "‘Military levers’: Pentagon relieved Solomon Islands attorney general ‘terminated’ China lease\n",
      "China’s latest attempt to establish a beachhead in the Pacific Islands has run aground, to the relief of United States leaders wary of Beijing’s growing naval power.          “This is an important decision to reinforce sovereignty, transparency, and the rule of law,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Friday. “Many nations in the Pacific have discovered far too late that Chinese use of economic and military levers to expand their influence often is detrimental to them and their people.”          Esper issued that statement in a public celebration of a decision by the attorney general of the Solomon Islands, who invalidated a deal that would have given the state-owned China Sam Group control of an entire island for 75 years. U.S. and other Western analysts believe China is trying to establish a naval base in the Pacific theater that could be used to threaten U.S. forces and American allies.          “That potentially extends out China's operating sphere to the inner rings of a key U.S. ally like Australia,” Patrick Buchan, a former Australian Defense Ministry adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Washington Examiner. “Anywhere on the map you can control, you can operate forward from there.”          Those plans are on hold, as Solomon Islands Attorney General John Muria declared the 75-year lease “unlawful, unenforceable and must be terminated with immediate effect” on Thursday evening. Muria concluded that the deal had not been vetted in advance, as required by law, and that “it does not contain essential clauses of such obligations of both parties” such as confidentiality agreements and termination clauses.          “This is just a stall,” opposition lawmaker Peter Kenilorea said. “The fact that the contract itself is flawed doesn’t negate the intention behind the signing. The intention is still there.\"          China has targeted the Solomon Islands with a charm offensive in recent months. Beijing persuaded the Pacific Island nation to cut ties with Taiwan, the island refuge of the government overthrown when the Chinese Communist party came to power in 1949. Chinese President Xi Jinping hosted Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare for a state visit on Oct. 10, followed by last week’s revelation that a Chinese company had cut a deal to invest in the island of Tulagi.          “Everyone is really scared about the possibility of China turning the island into a military base,” Michael Salini, a local business owner, said last week. “That is what really scares people — because why else do they want to lease the whole island?”          A naval port in that part of the world could give China significant leverage in a crisis, according to American analysts, by empowering the Chinese military eventually to interfere with the U.S. Navy’s supply lines between Hawaii and Guam, a crucial American military outpost in the Indo-Pacific. U.S officials believe Chinese war planners are using “predatory” economic investments to gain the ability to block the U.S. military from key ports around the world.          “I’m concerned by the [Chinese Communist Party’s] efforts to expand its military footprint in the Indo-Pacific region,” Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican member of the Armed Services Committee, told the Washington Examiner earlier this week. \"Pacific Island states are particularly vulnerable to China’s debt-trap diplomacy. The Administration has made significant strides over the past two years in collaborating with our Asian allies to offer these states financial alternatives to Beijing’s predatory lending.”          But the U.S. doesn’t have veto power over such agreements. “The key issue remains the level of concern and indeed anger among the populace of the Solomon Islands, ” Buchan said. “The leaders of the Solomon Islands have treated their own people like pawns on a chessboard.”\n",

      "China built almost 40% fewer skyscrapers in 2019, report says\n",
      "In the past year, the country completed just 56 new buildings measuring 200 meters (656 feet) or above, down more than 38% from the preceding year.          Such is China's domination of skyscraper construction, that despite the rest of the world increasing the number of 200-meter-plus buildings realized in 2019, the global total still fell by around 14%.          China still accounted for almost half of new completions worldwide, including six of the year's 10 tallest new towers. But the country's total was at its lowest since 2013, according to the CTBUH's annual report on global building trends.          The data presents a stark contrast to 2018, when China set a new record for the most skyscrapers ever built by a country in a single year.          Rather than singling out one reason for the drop, editor-in-chief of the CTBUH's journal, Daniel Safarik, pointed to myriad shifts in the country's political and economic climate.          \"Through the course of the year, everyone's been talking about storm clouds forming over Asia, particularly China,\" said Safarik, who co-authored the report, in a phone interview. \"That has been on the cards for a little while. A couple of years ago we started to see projects ... getting canceled.          \"We do know, as a general trend, that a lot of these projects were initiated with a good deal of debt.\"          There are signs that the building boom may have outstripped demand in parts of China. Take Tianjin, for instance, which is responsible for this year's tallest skyscraper -- the 530-meter (1,739-foot) Tianjin CTF Finance Centre, now the world's eighth highest. Here, there is a city-wide office vacancy rate of over 44%, according to data published by the real estate and investment firm CBRE, although the firm's head of research for Greater China, Ada Choi, said in an email to CNN that there is \"great variation in vacancy\" around the country.          This year's drop in new completions may also reflect changing official attitudes towards tall building projects. It could, Safarik suggested, signal less appetite for using landmark skyscrapers to put smaller cities on the map or spread investment away from dominant coastal areas.          \"There may have been some effort from the top to say 'let's cool things down a bit,'\" Safarik said, adding that many tall buildings in China are \"constructed by or developed by -- or, in some cases, both -- state-owned or heavily state-controlled companies.\"          Slowing the rate at which towers are built may, therefore, represent a welcome development after years of record-breaking growth, suggested Choi.          \"Mainland China has already dominated the list of the tallest buildings in the world ... and all of them were completed in the past four years,\" she said.          \"Considering the time needed to plan, construct and promote a super-tall building, I don't see an issue of having (fewer of them) in the coming years for those cities that already had one recently.\"          This year, China still completed four times as many 200-meter-plus buildings than the United States, which ranked a distant second.          The southern metropolis of Shenzhen also bucked the national trend. Its collection of 15 new buildings at 200 meters or above was more than any other city -- ahead of Dubai's nine and New York's eight -- and more than any country aside from China.          Having \"always had the green light as an economic entity to go fast,\" Shenzhen has \"stronger market justification\" for skyscrapers than other Chinese cities, Safarik said.          The city accounted for almost 12% of the 200-meter-plus buildings completed anywhere in the world in 2019.          Elsewhere in the CTBUH's report, there were some positive indicators for the industry. Amid a slowdown for some regions, the data pointed to a record-setting year for others.          And while the construction of 200-meter-plus buildings fell, those defined by the as \"supertall\" -- measuring 300 meters (984 feet) or above -- in fact grew globally this year. Twenty-six such buildings were completed around the world, in cities including Kuwait City, Kuala Lumpar and Busan in South Korea.          But this trend may also reflect uncertainty among developers. Creating taller buildings with a variety of functions can help spread risk, Safarik said.          \"It's rare you'd have the residential, hotel and office (sectors) crash at the same time,\" he explained. \"And given the fact these buildings are executed over a fairly long period of time, that's one way to hedge risk.\"          \"The economics of 200-meter-plus are so daunting,\" he added, \"that increasing the proportion of that group that is over 300 meters makes an absurd kind of sense.\"\n",

      "Justice in China is notoriously harsh, but reforms are afoot\n",
      "A ago, people across China were summoned to government offices. There they were given a piece of paper to sign. It contained several pledges, including not to take part in political protests, not to leave their districts and to keep their mobile phones switched on day and night with enabled. For good measure they were asked to affix their thumbprints. Those breaking their promises could be sure of the risk: imprisonment.          The “commitments to self-discipline”, as the documents were titled, were part of a nationwide ratcheting-up of security in preparation for official celebrations of 70 years of Communist rule on October 1st. Yet those who agreed to the stipulations had reason to feel relieved. At least they were not in prison already. They were convicts, but serving their sentences at home.\n",

      "Bond defaults have soared in China\n",
      "O China National Radio launched a mini-series to laud President Xi Jinping’s stewardship of the economy. For a state broadcaster, that might sound perfectly normal. But the theme of its first report was neither China’s stellar growth nor its sparkling innovations. Rather than such standard fare for propagandists, it focused on creditor committees, which aim to restructure companies that have run into financial difficulties. It was the latest sign of China’s rapid shift from denying that it had a debt problem just a few years ago to grappling with it publicly.          The bond market bears out the change. It was only in 2014 that China experienced its first default on a domestically traded bond. In 2018 defaults hit 117bn yuan ($16.5bn), triple the previous high. This year defaults are on track to reach roughly the same value. About 1% of all issuers defaulted in the first three quarters of this year, just a little below the global level, according to Fitch, a ratings agency. Bond defaults, says Global, another ratings company, are “becoming a norm”.          China’s central bank has tried to convey the message that this new norm is healthy. In its annual financial-stability report, published on November 25th, it said that the rise in defaults reflected the market’s maturation. As investors become more sensitive to risk, it added, they will steer capital towards more deserving firms, making for a stronger economy.          The central bank is right—up to a point. Defaults are part of any efficient bond market. The problem for China is that the broader trend masks a chasm between state-owned and private companies. Of the firms that have missed payments on bonds this year, 89% have come from the private sector, according to Fitch. Global calculates that 12% of private issuers since 2014 have defaulted, compared with just 0.2% of state firms. Over the past two years, private Chinese companies have been more likely than global issuers of junk-rated bonds to default.          This has only reinforced investors’ tendency to prefer state firms, in the belief that the government will usually act as a backstop. State firms have issued the vast majority of bonds in China this year; private firms have been all but shut out. In other words, it is not necessarily the most deserving firms that are attracting capital, as the central bank would like, but rather the best-connected firms.          The simplest way for China to change this is to allow more state-owned companies to default. The few that have missed bond payments in recent years have not been enough to persuade investors that government is cutting them loose.          So it was notable on November 22nd when Tewoo Group, a commodities trader owned by the city of Tianjin, asked creditors to take haircuts of up to 64% on their principal. Although its bonds were sold offshore, the impact will be felt domestically, because many creditors were Chinese. An eventual default would be the biggest on overseas bonds issued by a Chinese state firm since the late 1990s. But it is also only one step. Propaganda will serve as a good test: when the state broadcaster starts loudly reporting on the woes of state-owned firms, it will be clear that China has truly turned a corner. ■\n",

      "Russia, China and Iran seeking to influence US ahead of elections, top intelligence official says\n",
      "Russia is backing Donald Trump, China is supporting Joe Biden and Iran is seeking to sow chaos in the US presidential election, a top intelligence official has warned in a sobering assessment of foreign meddling.          The statement on Friday by William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, raises fears of a repeat of the 2016 election, when Russia manipulated social media to help Trump and hurt his opponent Hillary Clinton.          “Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia ‘establishment’,” Evanina said. “This is consistent with Moscow’s public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration’s policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia.”          Evanina identified Andriy Derkach, a pro-Russia Ukrainian politician, as “spreading claims about corruption – including through publicized leaked phone calls” to attack Biden’s campaign. The Washington Post reported that Derkach has met repeatedly with Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who has pushed conspiracy theories about the former vice-president.          Evanina also warned that some “Kremlin-linked actors” were spreading false claims about corruption to undermine Biden, while others were trying to “boost President Trump’s candidacy via social media and Russian television”.          Evanina, the top intelligence official monitoring threats to the election, is a Trump appointee. His statement lists China before Russia but presents less specific evidence of direct interference by Beijing.          “We assess that China prefers that President Trump – whom Beijing sees as unpredictable – does not win re-election,” Evanina said. “China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China’s interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China.”          He added: “Beijing recognizes that all of these efforts might affect the presidential race.”          Evanina highlighted China’s criticism of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the closure of China’s consulate in Houston and the White House responses to Chinese actions in Hong Kong and the South China Sea. On Friday, the US imposed sanctions on Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and 10 other senior officials. Trump has also ordered crackdowns on the Chinese owners of the popular apps TikTok and WeChat.          Iran, meanwhile, was seeking to undermine US democratic institutions and Trump, and to divide the country ahead of the 2020 elections, Evanina’s statement said.          “Iran’s efforts along these lines probably will focus on on-line influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-US content. Tehran’s motivation to conduct such activities is, in part, driven by a perception that President Trump’s reelection would result in a continuation of US pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change.”          Trump pulled the US out of a nuclear deal agreed by Barack Obama and imposed various sanctions on Tehran.          The anti-Trump pressure group National Security Action denied that China’s public actions rose to the level of Russia’s covert election interference. “Jarringly, the statement attempted to minimize what Russia is doing – again attacking our democracy in a bid to secure Trump’s reelection – by comparing it to China’s public criticism of the administration’s recent punitive measures against Beijing,” a spokesperson, Ned Price, said. “Any interference in our democracy is unacceptable, but there is no equivalence between the two efforts.”          In a press conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Friday evening, Trump reacted to the assessment by insisting: “I think that the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump because nobody’s been tougher on Russia than I have, ever.                    “China would love us to have an election where Donald Trump lost to ‘Sleepy’ Joe Biden. They would own our country. If Joe Biden was president, China would own our country ... Iran would love to see me not be president.”                    The president added: “I’ll make this statement. If and when we win, we will make deals with Iran very quickly. We’ll make deals with North Korea very quickly. Whatever happened to the war in North Korea? You haven’t seen that, have you?”          A hacking and social media campaign by Russia in 2016 is credited by US intelligence with helping Trump to victory. It triggered the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which described Russian meddling but did not conclude that there had been direct collusion by Trump or his campaign.          The November election is already under siege from the coronavirus pandemic, concerns over whether the system can handle a surge in mail-in voting and constant attacks by Trump on the integrity of the process.          Evanina warned that foreign adversaries may try to interfere with election systems by trying to sabotage the voting process, stealing election data or questioning the validity of results: “Foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections are a direct threat to the fabric of our democracy.”          The report raised concern on Capitol Hill. Marco Rubio and Mark Warner, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said they “encourage political leaders on all sides to refrain from weaponizing intelligence matters for political gain”.          Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, said: “It is no surprise our adversaries have preferences in our elections. Foreign nations have tried to influence our politics throughout American history. As Director Evanina’s statement makes clear, Russian malign influence efforts remain a significant threat. But it would be a serious mistake to ignore the growing threats posed by China and Iran.”\n",

      "Why the Coronavirus Could Threaten the U.S. Economy Even More Than China’s\n",
      "Consider travel. The average American takes three flights a year; the average Chinese person less than half a flight. And the epidemiological disaster of the Diamond Princess has persuaded many people to hold off on cruises. That cruise ship stigma alone potentially affects about 3.5 percent of the United States, which has about 11.5 million passengers each year, compared with only 0.17 percent of China, which has about 2.3 million passengers.          People may stop attending American sporting events. There have even been calls for the N.C.A.A. to play its March Madness college basketball tournament without an audience. But sports is a huge business in the United States. People spend upward of 10 times as much on sporting events as they do in China.          And if 60 million Americans stop spending $19 billion a year on gyms, that would be a much a bigger deal than if the 6.6 million gym members in China stopped spending the $6 billion they devote to gyms now.          That’s just a start. Who wants to go to the dentist or the hospital during an outbreak if a visit isn’t necessary? Yet health spending is 17 percent of the U.S. economy — more than triple the proportion spent in China.          Of course, not every service sector is so much larger than in China. Retail and restaurants, for example, have comparable shares of gross domestic product in both countries.          But over all, the United States is substantially more reliant on services than China is. And, on the flip side, agriculture, a sector not noted for day-to-day social interaction and so potentially less harmed by social withdrawal, is a 10 times larger share of China’s economy than it is in the United States.          So for all the talk about the global “supply shock” set off by the coronavirus outbreak and its impact on supply chains, we may have more to fear from an old-fashioned “demand shock” that emerges when everyone simply stays home. A major coronavirus epidemic in the United States might be like a big snowstorm that shuts down most economic activity and social interaction only until the snow is cleared away. But the coronavirus could be a “Snowmaggedon-style storm” that hits the whole country and lasts for months.          So go wash your hands for the full 20 seconds. And show some more sympathy for the folks quarantined in China and elsewhere. Because if it spreads rapidly in the United States, it could be a heck of a lot worse.
