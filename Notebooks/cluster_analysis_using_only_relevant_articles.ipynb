      "If You're Trying To Ban Guns, The Least You Can Do Is Learn The Basics\n",
      "Can anyone imagine a major newspaper running an op-ed justifying public ignorance on public policy? Actually, not merely justifying the ignorance, but rather arguing that facts only help smother discourse rather than enhance it. It’s improbable. Then again, this is the gun debate. And one side benefits from policy illiteracy.          The Washington Post ran an op-ed by former Gawker writer Adam Weinstein arguing that Second Amendment advocates use “jargon” to bully gun-control supporters. “While debating the merits of various gun control proposals,” he contends, “Second Amendment enthusiasts often diminish, or outright dismiss their views if they use imprecise firearms terminology.”          How dare Second Amendment advocates expect that those passionately arguing to limit their constitutional rights have some rudimentary knowledge of the devices they want to ban? To point out the constant glaring technical and policy “faux pas” of gun controllers, he argues, is to engage in “gunsplaining,” a bad-faith argument akin to intimidation.          “If you don’t know what the ‘AR’ in AR-15 stands for, you don’t get to talk” explains the sarcastic subhead. If you don’t know what the “AR” in AR-15 stands you still get to talk. But if you want to ban or confiscate AR-15s and you haven’t taken the time to learn what the AR stands for, then gun owners have every right to call you out.          Weinstein bemoans the unfairness of gun controllers “being forced to sweat the finest taxonomic distinctions between our nation’s unlimited variety of lethal weapons.” This statement is illustrative of the emotionalism and hyperbole of the debate (the notion that there’s an “unlimited variety” of firearms is absurd) but also, at the same time, it’s an exaggeration of the Second Amendment advocate’s expectations.          Like with any contemporary disputes over public policy, there will always be those who attempt to dismiss opponents who possess less expertise. It’s certainly not unique to this debate. And no, simply because a person refers to a “bullet” rather than a “cartridge” or “clip” rather than a “magazine” should not mean exclusion from conversation.          Then again, much of gun-control policy is driven by the mechanics of a firearm. So while not knowing what a “barrel shroud” is should not prevent anyone from pondering gun policy (well, unless you’re a politician who goes on TV to advocate the banning of barrel shrouds without knowing what they are), failing to understand the distinction between a semi-automatic and automatic weapon tells us you’re either dishonest, unserious or unprepared for the debate.          In a debate imbued with emotion, gun-control advocates rely on this ignorance. When Barack Obama tells a crowd that a mass shooter used a “fully automatic weapon,” he’s not concerned with the finest taxonomic distinctions of a gun, he’s depending on the yawning obliviousness of a cheering crowd. When CNN featured an alleged gun expert explaining that the AR-15 he’s about to fire is “full semi-automatic,” he’s making the functionality of firearm sound scarier to those who are ignorant about guns.          “Jargon” are words and expressions that are difficult for a layman to understand or use. Rather than use jargon, Second Amendment advocates are usually mocking those who use jargon-y sounding words in efforts to fearmonger viewers and constituents. When you claim that the streets are rife with “high-capacity, rapid-fire magazines” or “jumbo clips” you’re trying to fool your audience with a veneer of expertise you don’t possess. When you claim that we need to ban “gas-assisted, receiver firearms” you’re trying to make a semi-automatic weapon sound like a machine gun for a reason.          It’s not always the mechanics, either. When Joe Scarborough misrepresents the Heller decision, he’s preying on policy ignorance that has little to do with gun culture. When Steve Schmidt goes on television and passionately tells an audience that it’s more difficult to buy cough medicine than an “AK-47 – or 50 of them,” he’s either lying or he has absolutely no grasp of how gun policy works. Either way, he shouldn’t be talking to grownups about firearms.          All these people use a moralistic fallacy, which is often predicated on the ignorance Weinstein rationalizes. Not that it stops him from embracing the appeal to authority he condemns elsewhere.          For example, Weinstein takes Fox News personality Tomi Lahren to task for failing to mention that “the family” of Eugene Stoner, the AR-15’s designer and champion, claimed in 2016 that the inventor would be “horrified and sickened to see his military rifle pattern become so common in civilian households and school shootings.” You’ll notice the conflation. Of course Stoner would be horrified that his gun was used in school shootings. But Weinstein fails to note that there’s no evidence anywhere on the record that Stoner was “horrified and sickened” by the notion of civilians owning his gun. Since he was selling proto AR-15s to civilians a decade before his military model was adopted by the United States, we have no reason to believe he would be.          Perhaps that kind of discussion spurns conversation in favor of condescension. But at least it’s a debate that revolves around the veracity of facts. Which is a lot more I can say for the rest of the “gunsplaining” grievance.\n",

      "San Francisco officials brand NRA a ‘domestic terrorist organization’\n",
      "The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association a “domestic terrorist organization” and urged the federal government to do the same – the latest escalation in the heated rhetoric from Democrats regarding the NRA in the wake of several deadly mass shootings. The resolution, which passed Tuesday and says the U.S. is “plagued by an epidemic of gun violence,” accuses the NRA of using “its considerable wealth and organization strength to promote gun ownership and incite gun owners to acts of violence.”          2020 DEMS RAMP UP CALLS TO MANDATE ASSAULT WEAPONS BUYBACK: 'ALL OF THEM'          “All countries have violent and hateful people, but only in America do we give them ready access to assault weapons and large-capacity magazines thanks, in large part, to the National Rifle Association’s influence,” the resolution says. The document resolves to assess the relationships that those who do business with the city have with the group and says “the City and County of San Francisco should take every reasonable step to limit those entities who do business with the City and County of San Francisco from doing business with this domestic terrorist organization.”          The resolution cites the July mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival, in which three people were killed. KTVU reports that the resolution’s author wrote the text after that shooting. The NRA responded by calling the resolution a stunt that was distracting from the city’s myriad of social problems. CHICAGO MAYOR CLASHES WITH CRUZ OVER GUN VIOLENCE: 'KEEP OUR NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH'          \"This ludicrous stunt by the Board of Supervisors is an effort to distract from the real problems facing San Francisco, such as rampant homelessness, drug abuse and skyrocketing petty crime, to name a few,” the statement said, according to KTVU. “The NRA will continue working to protect the constitutional rights of all freedom-loving Americans.\" The measure comes as Democrats across the country are ramping up calls to crack down on gun ownership, in response to deadly mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and western Texas. Some presidential candidates have proposed mandatory buyback programs, notably Beto O'Rourke who bluntly told reporters that would be the plan. “I want to be really clear that that’s exactly what we are going to do,” O’Rourke said. “Gun control doesn’t work. Look at Chicago. Disarming law-abiding citizens isn’t the answer,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tweeted Monday.\n",

      "New Zealand Gun Buyback Was An ‘Unmitigated Failure’\n",
      "Many New Zealand gun owners have refused to participate in a mandatory buyback program of military-style semi-automatic weapons implemented after the Christchurch massacre in March.          Despite a penalty of up to five years in prison, up to two-thirds of firearms banned by the legislation were not turned in before the Friday deadline by New Zealand gun owners, the Washington Post reported.          While 47,000 semi-automatic rifles have been collected, according to police statistics, a government commissioned study determined that the small nation likely contains between 56,000 and 170,000 now banned weapons, according to 1 News.          New Zealand’s largest gun rights advocacy group, the Licensed Firearms Owners Council, remarked that the buyback program has been an “unmitigated failure.”          Police Minister Stuart Nash blamed the government’s inability to enforce its buyback scheme on a lack of gun registration. “The problem is we just don’t know exactly how many guns are out in the community, this is why we need a register, to enable Police to better track firearms,” he said, according to 1 News.          On March 15, 2019, a right-wing extremist opened fire on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand during Friday prayer, killing 51 worshipers and injuring 49 others. As a result of this terrorist attack, New Zealand’s parliament quickly passed legislation to ban all weapons similar to the ones used by the shooter.          When it was first proposed, New Zealand’s plan to confiscate military-style weapons was praised by members of the American left. Several Democratic presidential candidates, most notably New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, have been vocal with their support for similar programs. (RELATED: Bernie Sanders Discovers Second Amendment Rights)          However, some experts said that the failure of New Zealand’s confiscation efforts bode poorly for similar programs proposed in the United States.          “The great majority of American rifles and handguns are semi automatic. I can’t imagine American gun owners going along with this [buybacks], even to the modest level of compliance that New Zealand seems to have gotten,” Eugene Volokh, a legal scholar from the University of California, told the Post.          The Post also noted how the vast majority of New Zealanders support more gun control, and that the country lacks constitutional protections for the right to bear arms — unlike the U.S.\n",

      "Fighting gun trafficking gets ensnared in political fight\n",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - When Pennsylvania lawmakers were rushing to wrap up the session’s business in June, aides to state Attorney General Josh Shapiro came to them with a request: expand the office’s authority to pursue gun-trafficking crimes across the state.          The idea was to insert the measure into a fast-tracked bill dealing with drug crimes. But the request - to give the office statewide jurisdiction to prosecute illegal gun possession, sales and transfers - got put aside for the summer amid objections, apparently revolving around law-enforcement turf and gun politics.          “It didn’t take long to become apparent that the statewide jurisdictional change was going to cause far too many problems with legislation that had to get done,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rob Kauffman, who was in charge of shepherding the bill.          Calls to respond to gun violence in Pennsylvania have only grown since then, coming to a head in mid-August when a man with a long criminal record - which barred him from legally possessing firearms - allegedly shot and wounded six Philadelphia police officers during a standoff.          Still, it’s unclear whether the provision has any chance of becoming law in the Republican-controlled Legislature after lawmakers return to session in September.          Under current law, the attorney general’s office cannot prosecute gun-trafficking cases without a referral from a district attorney.          Shapiro’s aides point to the success of a joint gun-violence task force that, since 2006, has stationed state gun-trafficking agents in Philadelphia and personnel in the Philadelphia district attorney’s office to prosecute those cases.          The attorney general’s office could use the authority to offer similar help to police departments and district attorneys in other counties, Shapiro’s aides said, and track gun-trafficking pipelines across the state.          It’s not necessarily novel: The attorney general’s office already has legal authority to prosecute various crimes without a district attorney’s referral, including human trafficking and narcotics.          After receiving the request, House Judiciary Committee staff checked with a short list of law enforcement organizations and gun-rights groups to see if they would support the idea, said Kauffman, R-Franklin.          Not all of them did.          Kauffman would not say exactly who objected to it, or describe specific objections, although he acknowledged discomfort from gun-rights proponents.          “I would say that generally our second amendment advocates do have concern with folks they perceive as anti-gun proposing or attempting to infringe on their rights through additional laws,” Kauffman said.          Shapiro, a Democrat who is widely viewed as a future candidate for governor, backs various bills that gun-rights groups have tended to oppose, such as an expansion of background checks to private sales of shotguns, sporting rifles and semi-automatic rifles.          Rep. Jared Solomon, D-Philadelphia, a lead supporter of expanding the attorney general’s authority to enforce gun-trafficking laws, said Judiciary Committee staff told him that the NRA opposed the provision.          “The NRA will tell you they want to enforce the laws on the books, so what did we do? We give them a vehicle to do just that, which is to enforce the laws on the books, which is to provide more resources to that end. And they said, ‘No,’” said Solomon.          An NRA spokeswoman countered that the organization took no position on the bill, and said it routinely calls for the enforcement of existing gun laws.          “Criminals should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and we take no position on who should do the prosecuting,” NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter said in a statement.          Kim Stolfer, chairman of the Pennsylvania-based gun-rights group, Firearms Owners Against Crime, said he told Judiciary Committee staff that he had no problem with the idea.          “If you commit a crime with a firearm, you should pay a price and we’re not doing that,” Stolfer said.          The state Fraternal Order of Police lodge and the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association said they had not been asked for an official position.          But the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association, which represents 66 of the state’s 67 county prosecutors, had objections. Its director of legislation and policy, Greg Rowe, said the association would support the measure only with certain parameters: giving a district attorney the “right of first refusal” to prosecute the case or linking the jurisdiction to a joint task force.          Rowe said he didn’t hear back from the committee after he pitched the counterproposal.          Shapiro’s aides, meanwhile, said they had had conflicting reports about who objected.          “We heard first that, ‘Yep, we’re in good shape, everyone’s good with this,’” said David Wade, Shapiro’s chief of staff. “And then we heard, ‘Change in plans, this isn’t going.’”\n",

      "The Latest: Evers faults Republicans for punting on guns\n",
      "MADISON, Wis. (AP) - The Latest on the Wisconsin Legislature’s special session on gun control (all times local):          Gov. Tony Evers says Republicans in the Legislature just told a majority of Wisconsin residents to “go jump in a lake” by not voting on a pair of gun control measures.          The Senate and Assembly on Thursday both essentially ignored the governor’s call for a special session to take up a universal background check and “red flag” bill. Evers cited polls showing more than 80% support for the issues and said Republicans didn’t have the courage to take a vote.          Evers says Republicans “did so at their own peril” because now they have to explain their action to voters.          Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos accused Evers of playing politics and said he wasn’t going to vote on bills he knew wouldn’t pass.          Wisconsin Republicans dodged the Democratic governor’s call to pass a pair of gun control bills during a special session, brushing aside advocates’ demands to take action before more people die.          Gov. Tony Evers, the state attorney general, gun control advocates and Democratic lawmakers all urged Republicans to vote on the bills Thursday. But Republicans ignored them, convening the special session separately in the Senate and Assembly and adjourning within seconds without taking action.          Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald convened and then immediately adjourned the session about 30 seconds later in an empty Senate chamber. The Assembly was in session about 10 seconds.          Evers last month ordered a special session for Thursday afternoon to address a bill that would impose universal background checks on gun sales. Another bill Evers wanted them to pass would establish a so-called red flag law in Wisconsin. Such laws allow family members and police to ask judges to temporarily seize firearms from people who may pose a threat.          The Republican leader of the Wisconsin Senate gaveled into a special session on gun control and ended it 30 seconds later.          Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald took the action in an empty Senate chamber Thursday night shortly after 8 p.m. He has long opposed the special session called by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to pass a universal background check and “red flag” bill.          Gov. Tony Evers, the state attorney general, gun control advocates and Democratic lawmakers all urged Republicans to vote on the bills. But Republicans ignored them.          The Assembly planned to take similar action, quickly convening and adjourning the special session, later Thursday night.          Democrats say Republicans are ignoring what the public wants and putting public safety at risk.          Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos is accusing Democratic Gov. Tony Evers of “playing politics” by calling a special session on gun control.          Vos said the Assembly will not debate or vote on the bills Thursday in the special session. He plans to gavel in and quickly adjourn the session. The Senate is doing the same thing.          Vos says, “I don’t necessarily want to spend a bunch of time playing politics with this which is what it seems our Democratic colleagues want to do.”          Democrats say Republicans should pass universal background checks and a “red flag” law in part because polls show broad public support.          Vos says Republicans won’t support the bills because they infringe upon Second Amendment gun rights.          Several dozen people are rallying on the steps of the state Capitol in Madison in hopes of persuading Republican lawmakers to vote on two bills restricting firearm ownership.          Democratic Gov. Tony Evers called a special legislation session on the bills for Thursday afternoon. The measures would mandate universal background checks and allow family members or police to ask judges to temporarily seize guns from people who pose a threat. Republicans who control the Legislature say they won’t even debate the bills.          About 75 people rallied outside the Capitol ahead of the session in sub-freezing temperatures. They held signs that read “#allowthevote” and “Protect Kids Not NRA,” a reference to the National Rifle Association.          Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul warmed up the crowd, saying it’s time for Republicans to act and people have had enough of “political cowardice.”          Thomas Leager of the conservative group Wisconsin Patriots Alliance showed up in a sweat-shirt emblazoned with a picture of a revolver. He told a reporter that universal background checks would be unmanageable and police breaking down doors to seize people’s guns would result in only more deaths.          Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is demanding Republican legislators vote on a pair of bills restricting firearm ownership.          Evers in October ordered a special legislative session on gun control to begin Tuesday afternoon. He wants to them to vote on bills mandating universal background checks and allowing family members or police to ask judges to temporarily seize firearms from people who pose a threat.          Republican leaders say they won’t even consider the bills. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald says he plans to gavel in and gavel out seconds later, ending the session.          Evers sent Fitzgerald and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos a letter Thursday morning blasting them for “ignoring the will of the people” and demanding they vote on the proposals. He says Wisconsin residents deserve to know where their legislators stand on the bills.          Gun-control advocates are imploring Wisconsin Republicans to pass a pair of bills restricting firearm ownership during a legislative special session.          Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in October ordered a special session to begin Thursday afternoon on bills mandating universal background checks and allowing judges to temporarily seize guns from people who pose a threat.          Republicans have said they won’t so much as debate the bills. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald has said his chamber plans to gavel in and immediately gavel out, ending the session in that house.          A group of gun control advocates held a news conference Thursday morning in the state Capitol. They called the bills moderate, common-sense proposals that most Wisconsin residents support.          Karly Scholz, a 16-year-old junior at Madison West High School, is the Wisconsin state director for March for Our Lives, an anti-gun group that formed in the wake of a school shooting in Parkland, Florida. She said she and her fellow students go to school every day fearing for their lives. She said Republicans’ refusal to take up the bills equates to the GOP saying students’ lives don’t matter.          Gun control advocates are set to rally in Madison ahead of a special legislative session on gun restrictions that’s expected to go nowhere.          Democratic Gov. Tony Evers last month ordered a special session to take up bills mandating universal background checks and allowing judges to temporarily seize guns from people who pose a threat.          Groups including Moms Demand Action, Doctors for America and the Episcopal Diocese of Milwaukee will hold news conferences and rally at the state Capitol ahead of the session.          Republicans have said they will gavel in and immediately gavel out, ending the session as soon as it begins.\n",

      "Analysis | Marco Rubio’s claim that no recent mass shootings would have been prevented by gun laws\n",
      "“None of the major shootings that have occurred in this country over the last few months or years that have outraged us, would gun laws have prevented them.”          A colleague pointed out this statement by Marco Rubio as a possible fact check, suggesting that it was almost certainly incorrect. It posed an interesting challenge, given the reams of data to examine.          The Fact Checker obviously takes no position on proposed gun-control laws. But given the attention of recent mass public shootings, is Rubio correct that none of the major shootings in recent years would have been prevented by new gun laws?          Rubio was not specific in his time frame — and a spokesman declined to elaborate — but for the purposes of this fact check we will go back as far as the Newtown shooting in 2012, which touched off the current gun debate.          First of all, we should note that there is an unbridgeable gap in opinion about efficacy of various gun proposals, particularly regarding assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.          “The common thread that binds most mass shootings is semiautomatic firearms with the ability to accept a high-capacity detachable ammunition magazine,” said Avery Palmer, communications director at the Violence Policy Center, which supports restrictions on guns. “These can range from assault rifles, pistols, and shotguns, to compact, high-capacity pistols marketed for concealed carry. Today’s gun industry has embraced increased lethality as its marketing lodestar, and one key element in reducing the occurrence and severity of mass shootings lies in ratcheting down the firepower in civilian hands.”          By contrast, gun-rights supporters argue that bans on certain weapons and large-capacity magazines would accomplish little. There are already more than 5 million AR-type rifles in circulation in the United States, ownership of which would have been grandfathered under proposed bans.          A previous nationwide assault-weapons ban, which lasted 10 years and lapsed in 2004, was easily circumvented by gun manufacturers, in part because of various loopholes. The evidence is mixed on how effective that ban was, with both sides often cherry-picking from the most comprehensive report on that law, written in 2004 by Christopher Koper of George Mason University. “The ban did not appear to affect gun crime during the time it was in effect, but some evidence suggests it may have modestly reduced gunshot victimizations had it remained in place for a longer period,” Koper wrote in 2013.          John R. Lott Jr., at the pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center, notes that such bans would target .223-caliber weapons but would not affect more powerful semiautomatic rifles using .30-06 caliber, which are used for hunting deer. (This video demonstrates the difference.)          Meanwhile, an experienced shooter, as shown in this video, can change a magazine in just two to four seconds. That calls into question whether such a ban would significantly reduce the death toll.          A new study by Gary Kleck of Florida State University studied news accounts of 23 shootings between 1994 and 2013 in which more than six people were killed or wounded and large-capacity magazines were used. In only one case was a shooter stopped as he tried to reload. In all of these 23 incidents, the shooter possessed either multiple guns or multiple magazines, indicating that a determined shooter would not have been deterred by smaller magazines.          Now let’s look at the facts behind Rubio’s statement. Is there evidence that gun law proposals would have prevented the recent high-profile mass shootings?          We developed the following list of 12 mass shootings since 2012 catalogued in the Mother Jones database of U.S. mass shootings, with details obtained from various news and official reports. We will look at whether proposals might have made a difference in how the guns were obtained, or whether existing laws worked as intended.          Dec. 2, 2015: Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., using a Smith & Wesson M&P AR-15 type rifle, a DPMS Panther Arms AR-15 type rifle, a Smith & Wesson semiautomatic pistol and a Llama semiautomatic pistol. The guns were purchased legally and the rifles were purchased legally by a former neighbor. (The transfer of the rifles to the suspects may have violated California and federal laws.) Four high-capacity magazines were found, perhaps holding as many as 30 rounds.          Oct. 1, 2015: Christopher Harper-Mercer killed nine people at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. He owned 14 firearms and conducted the attack with six of them, including a Glock pistol, a Smith & Wesson pistol, a Taurus pistol and a Del-Ton AR-15 rifle. All were purchased legally.          July 16, 2015: Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez killed five people and wounded two at the Navy Operational Support Center and Marine Corps Reserve Center in Chattanooga, Tenn. He used an AK-47-style rifle and 9mm handgun, and a shotgun was in his car. He had multiple 30-round magazines, news reports said. Officials said the gun was obtained legally; other weapons were obtained through Armslist.com, an online forum through which individuals can buy and sell firearms through private transactions.          June 17, 2015: Dylann Roof killed nine people with a .45-caliber Glock pistol that held 13 rounds at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C. Roof legally purchased his gun from a store, but the FBI said he should have failed the background check because he had been charged with possessing Suboxone without a prescription. However, because of clerical mistakes, the FBI said the examiner did not get hold of the report before the three-day waiting period ended, and so the store went through with the purchase.          Oct. 24, 2014: Jaylen Ray Fryberg, a teenager, killed four students with a high-capacity Beretta pistol at the Marysville-Pilchuck High School cafeteria in Marysville, Wash. The pistol belonged to his father, who was the subject of a permanent protection order. That should have prevented the purchase of the gun, but the order had not been entered in the system and so his father passed the background check. The father was later found guilty of knowingly purchasing six firearms he could not legally possess.          Feb. 20, 2014: Cherie Lash Rhoades killed four people and wounded two at the Cedarville Rancheria Tribal Office and Community Center in Alturas, Calif. She used a 9mm semiautomatic handgun and stabbed a person with a butcher knife when a second gun apparently jammed. It isn’t clear how the gun was obtained; her trial has not taken place. (Note: Rhoades killed her brother, niece, nephew and another tribal member, so some might say this is a family dispute, not a mass public shooting.)          Sept. 16, 2013: Aaron Alexis, who had been treated for mental health issues but never committed, killed 12 people with a Remington shotgun at the Washington Navy Yard. He had tried to buy a handgun at a Virginia store but changed his mind after he was told it would have to be delivered to his home state through another federally licensed dealer. But he was able to purchase a shotgun. He passed state and federal background checks; he had been arrested three times but not convicted.          July 26, 2013: Pedro Vargas set fire to his apartment in Hialeah, Fla., and killed six people with a Glock 17 9mm semiautomatic handgun. Vargas bought his handgun legally and had a concealed weapons permit. (Note: Most of the deaths took place in an apartment complex, not a public space, so some say this should not be considered a public shooting.)          June 7, 2013: John Zawahri killed five people in Santa Monica, Calif., using a .223 semiautomatic rifle, similar in type to an AR-15. He also had multiple 30-round magazines — which are illegal in California — and during the rampage had dropped a bag which contained additional loaded magazines, a handgun and the upper receiver for a semiautomatic rifle. He also appeared to have made some weapons that are illegal. Investigators later found a 2011 letter from the Department of Justice informing Zawahri that he was not eligible to purchase a firearm.          April 21, 2013: Dennis Clark III shot and killed his girlfriend in their apartment in Federal Way, Wash., and then killed three other people using a .40-caliber Taurus semiautomatic pistol and a pistol-grip Mossberg 500 pump shotgun with a four-round saddle. The weapons were obtained legally, and he had a concealed pistol license.          March 13, 2013: Kurt Myers killed four people and wounded two with a shotgun in neighboring towns in Herkimer County, N.Y. The shotgun apparently was obtained legally.          Dec. 14, 2012: Adam Lanza killed his mother in their home with a Savage Mark II .22-caliber rifle and then killed 26 people, mostly children, with a Bushmaster XM-15 rifle (with a 30-round magazine) at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. His weapons, which also included handguns and a 12-gauge semiautomatic shotgun, were found in Lanza’s car outside the school and had been legally obtained by his mother, a gun enthusiast. Lanza, in effect, stole his mother’s firearms.          This is certainly a depressing chronicle of death and tragedy. But Rubio’s statement stands up to scrutiny — at least for the recent past, as he framed it. Notably, three of the mass shootings took place in California, which already has strong gun laws including a ban on certain weapons and high-capacity magazines.          Gun-control advocates often point to the experience in other countries that have enacted gun laws that heavily restrict gun ownership; as we have shown, quantitative measures of cross-comparative crime statistics, especially where the crime is not consistently defined (i.e., “mass shooting”), usually end up being apples-to-oranges comparisons. It is possible that some gun-control proposals, such as a ban on large-capacity magazines, would reduce the number of dead in a future shooting, though the evidence for that is heavily disputed. But Rubio was speaking in the past, about specific incidents. He earns a rare Geppetto Checkmark.

      "Republicans Blocked A Gun Control Bill During Another School Shooting\n",
      "WASHINGTON — Sen. Chris Murphy attempted to pass a gun control package Thursday morning, watched it get blocked by Republicans, and then gave a speech about the need to do something about the regular mass shootings in America. He didn’t know until he walked out that another mass shooting had just happened, this time at a high school in California.          “I found out as soon as I walked off the floor,” Murphy told medianame News.          Two students were killed and several others were injured when a 16-year-old went on a shooting spree at a school in Santa Clarita on Thursday morning.          Murphy had asked for the Senate to unanimously agree to pass universal background checks for firearms, as he’s done repeatedly for months. “The American public are not going to accept silence from the body week after week, month after month in the face of this epidemic carnage that is happening in this country,” he said.          But even after news of the shooting spread through the Senate — Sen. Richard Blumenthal found out via a note from a staffer while he was giving a speech about gun violence — Murphy said he doesn’t believe it will change anything.          “I wish this weren’t the case, but Republicans’ interest in working on guns is driven by casualties of 15 or more. It’s so awful that it works like this,” he said. “I don’t doubt that we’ll be back in a conversation about background checks, but it probably won’t happen until there’s another epic-scale shooting.”          Some Republicans have long opposed the bill, arguing that universal background checks violate Second Amendment rights. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, the Republican who objected to Murphy trying to get a vote on the bill Thursday morning, argued that the legislation “should not be fast-tracked by the Senate.”          “Many questions about this legislation need to be answered before it’s forced upon law-abiding gun owners,\" Hyde-Smith said.          In September, House Democrats advanced three additional gun bills following mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, which left a total of 31 people dead. There was also momentum toward a bipartisan gun control package negotiated with the White House.          But Murphy said he hadn’t heard from the Trump administration about background checks since September.          Lindsey Graham, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said there is bipartisan support for one part of a gun control package — a grant program that encourages states to set up “red flag” programs that allow law enforcement officers to preemptively seize a person’s firearms if they are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. But he said progress on background checks has stalled, and blamed, in part, the House impeachment inquiry.          “Impeachment has sucked all the oxygen out. But I hope we will revisit. I really do. I am ready to do something yesterday,” said Graham.          The House passed universal background checks in late February. The bill received bipartisan support with eight Republicans crossing the aisle to vote for the legislation. Since then, universal background checks have remained stalled in the Republican-led Senate at the behest of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.          Attorney General Bill Barr blamed the House impeachment hearings for derailing the progress on gun control during an event in Tennessee on Wednesday. But Murphy refuted those claims Thursday morning.          “That’s not true,” Murphy said, addressing Barr’s comments on the Senate floor. “The impeachment proceedings right now are in the House of Representatives; the discussion on the future of the background checks bill was in the Senate.”\n",

      "The 3 Worst Arguments Against Gun Control\n",
      "As the pressure continues to build for congressional action on gun violence in the wake of the Orlando massacre, the gun control debate will continue, in Congress and elsewhere. The opponents of proposals like universal background checks and closing the “terror gap” are deploying their well-worn bumper sticker arguments, with a superficial appeal that too often wins the day, in defiance of logic and evidence. Here are the three worst arguments against stronger gun laws and why Congress should reject them out of hand.          This is the granddaddy of them all, a brilliantly clever way of conveying two related ideas: (1) because guns themselves are morally neutral objects that become a problem only when used by dangerous people, it makes sense only to focus on punishing bad people who use guns, rather than regulating guns themselves; and (2) even if dangerous people can’t get guns, they will simply use other weapons to inflict death and injury. In short, there is no gun problem; there is only a people problem.          Would we find this reasoning persuasive in other contexts involving dangerous products? Consider automobiles, for example. A car also is pretty innocuous sitting in a driveway, until it comes into contact with a driver who may be untrained or reckless. Yet our public policy toward preventing auto injuries is not confined to punishing careless or reckless drivers following a tragedy. We think it equally important to have a licensing system in place to prevent untrained and potentially high-risk people from driving in the first place. Similarly, we should have laws in place to prevent dangerous people from having guns—at the very least, required background checks for all gun sales.          Yes, it is true that dangerous people could turn to other weapons if denied access to guns. But this is a false equivalence. Research shows that attacks with guns are five times more likely to be lethal than attacks with knives, for example. Does anyone really believe that the Orlando shooter could have killed 49 people and injured 53 others with a knife or baseball bat? Guns don’t kill people, but people with guns kill people, far more effectively and efficiently than with other weapons.          This is the futility argument. According to the National Rifle Association and its allies, since gun laws are directed at criminals, who of course pay no attention to any laws (that’s why they’re called criminals), gun control can’t possibly be effective, except in making it harder for law-abiding citizens to have guns to defend themselves.          First, the argument is transparently circular. Of course, as to individuals who are willing to disobey gun laws, the laws are futile by definition. But what about the possibility that there are potentially violent individuals who are deterred from carrying guns by the illegality of doing so? Surely compliance with a law cannot be determined merely by looking at the instances of when the law is violated. If it could, we would regard all our criminal laws as ultimately futile because all of them are frequently violated. Should we repeal our laws against homicide because murderers don’t obey them?          It turns out that there is substantial evidence that many criminals may refrain from gun carrying because of gun control laws. In one survey, incarcerated felons who had not carried weapons during the commission of their crimes were asked why they decided against being armed. Fifty-nine percent chose the response “Against the law.”          In addition, the argument proceeds from a false premise, i.e., that the effectiveness of gun control laws depends on compliance by criminals. Take the Brady Act, for instance. It requires licensed gun dealers to submit the gun purchaser’s name for a background check and to refuse the sale if the check reveals a disqualifying record. If the dealer is willing to obey the law, the criminal’s preferred source of guns will be denied him. “Terror gap” legislation simply adds persons on the “no-fly” list and other suspected terrorists to the categories of persons who will be denied purchases from licensed dealers. The effectiveness of such background checks do not depend on the willingness of criminals and suspected terrorists to obey the law.          Of course, it is possible that dangerous gun buyers will turn to other sources for their guns, but that is a reason to extend mandatory background checks to all gun sales, not just sales by licensed dealers. There may be some gun sellers who will ignore the law, but we don’t consider other laws to be ineffective simply because compliance is not universal. The point is that gun control laws can reduce access to guns by criminals and terrorists without compliance with those laws by criminals and terrorists.          Any Gun Control Is a Slippery Slope to Confiscation          This canard is particularly important to the gun lobby because, since even most NRA members actually support modest measures like background checks, it is strategically critical for the NRA to argue that such reforms should be defeated because they will lead ultimately to more radical measures that the gun-owning public strongly opposes.          The slippery slope argument would have validity if it were difficult to logically distinguish the proposal at the top of the slope (say, universal background checks) from the feared proposal at the bottom of the slope, i.e., a complete ban on gun ownership. But of course support for a proposal like universal background checks, closing the “terror gap,” and even licensing of gun owners and registration of guns does not logically entail support for a broad gun ban. The slippery slope is more like a flight of stairs, in which it is quite possible for make a valid argument for taking the first step, e.g., universal background checks, which would still allow law-abiding citizens to own guns, without logically committing oneself to several steps down, e.g., a gun ban, under which even law-abiding citizens would be barred from gun ownership.          Even as a historical matter, there is no basis to believe that enacting some gun regulation leads inevitably to broad gun bans. Take the idea of registering guns like we register cars. Gun partisans have an intense fear of registration because they regard it as a slippery slope to confiscation; once the government knows who owns the guns, it will be nicely positioned to confiscate them. But the State of Pennsylvania, for example, has maintained a database of persons who lawfully purchased handguns since 1931, and there is no reason to believe that the authorities are likely to start knocking on the doors of Pennsylvania gun owners, demanding surrender of their guns.          The fact is that the slippery slope argument is, at its core, nothing but uninformed speculation. There is, however, a steep social cost to that speculation if we allow it to block enactment of sensible policies, like universal background checks, that help to prevent dangerous people from getting guns. If Congress had been persuaded by the slippery slope argument during the Brady Bill debate, since 1994 we would have allowed more than two million legally prohibited gun buyers to buy guns over-the-counter that were, instead, blocked by Brady background checks.          How many more Americans must needlessly perish before we insist that our gun policies be based on reason and evidence, not on the bumper sticker logic of the gun lobby?          Dennis A.

      "Scores of New Laws Take Effect Across the United States\n",
      "Scores of new laws are taking effect across the country with the start of 2020, affecting wages, privacy rights, gun laws, marijuana use, criminal justice and more. The minimum wage has gone up in 21 different states and in about two dozen cities and counties across California.          The California Consumer Privacy Act now allows California residents to learn what data companies have collected about them — and to demand those companies delete the data, if residents want.          California has also suspended the statute of limitations for sexual abuse crimes for three years, allowing survivors the chance to pursue prosecution.          Colorado has tightened its gun laws, although a number of Colorado counties oppose the new measure and have declared themselves to be Second Amendment “sanctuaries.” Tennessee has loosened its gun laws by making it easier for residents to receive a concealed-carry handgun permit.          In Illinois, marijuana is now legal.          In New York, cash bail has been eliminated for most misdemeanor and nonviolent felony cases, in a move criminal justice reform advocates say could lead to the release of thousands of people incarcerated before their trial.          And California has become the first state in the country to explicitly ban discrimination against people based on their natural hair. The CROWN Act now makes it illegal for employers or school officials to impose dress codes or policies that ban afros, braids, locks or other hairstyles. California state Senator Holly Mitchell celebrated the move, saying, “This law protects the right of black Californians to choose to wear their hair in its natural form, without pressure to conform to Eurocentric norms.”\n",

      "San Francisco passes resolution calling NRA \"domestic terrorist organization\"\n",
      "The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday calling the National Rifle Association a \"domestic terrorist organization.\" The resolution also urges local organizations to stop doing business with the gun rights group.          \"The leadership of National Rifle Association promotes extremist positions, in defiance of the views of a majority of its membership and the public, and undermine the general welfare,\" the resolution says.          \"The National Rifle Association through its advocacy has armed those individuals who would and have committed acts of terrorism.\"          It also accuses the NRA of inciting gun owners \"to acts of violence\" and spreading \"propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence.\"          The resolution says the city and county of San Francisco \"should take every reasonable step\" to limit financial and contractual relationships with the NRA. It calls on other cities, states and the federal government to do the same.          The resolution from the board of supervisors — and 11-member legislative group representing the city and county — is mostly symbolic, and does not have a direct impact on local policy.          It was passed weeks after a mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in the San Francisco Bay Area, where three people were killed and 12 were injured. The resolution notes that there have been more mass shootings than days in 2019.          The NRA tweeted Wednesday calling the resolution \"a reckless assault on a law-abiding organization, it's members, and the freedoms they all stand for.\"          \"We remain undeterred - guided by our values and belief in those who want to find real solutions to violence,\" the NRA said.          The NRA has consistently opposed gun control efforts and financially supported politicians who oppose them as well. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre spoke with President Trump on the phone last month in the wake of the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. Soon after the call, Mr. Trump backed away from his previous calls for stronger background checks — something the NRA has lobbied against.\n",

      "George H.W. Bush, Barack Obama shared realist view of foreign policy\n",
      "Presidents George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama hailed from different political parties but shared a common foreign policy outlook.          In administrations 20-plus years apart, each brought a realpolitik outlook of sorts to the White House. Their principles guided American foreign policy according to concrete international interests — even if it meant cozying up to less-than-savory world leaders. Each alternatively faced criticism and praise in various quarters for seeming to shun democratic ideals in favor of lower oil prices, regional stability in the Middle East, and other concrete outcomes.          In June 1989, early into Bush’s White House tenure, China’s military suppressed a pro-democracy movement demonstrating in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Using tanks and armored cars, the military crushed the demonstrations and fired into the crowd, killing hundreds of protesters.          Despite outcries in Congress — controlled by Democrats — Bush did not want to jettison improved U.S.-China relations by overreacting to events. His administration imposed only limited sanctions. In subsequent months, Bush sent national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, to China to try to repair the damaged, but not destroyed, relationship.          Nearly a quarter-century later, Obama in the White House similarly made human rights only one of several foreign policy considerations. As the Syrian civil war worsened into 2013, dictator Bashar Assad fired rockets filled with sarin gas into towns around Damascus, killing an estimated 1,400 civilians. Obama said use of chemical weapons against civilians would trigger a “red line,” seemingly for military action.          But there was little enthusiasm in the U.S. Congress for action, so Obama quietly backed down from his threat and punted the solution to the Russians, who were all-too-willing to flex their power-brokering influence in the Middle East.          Bush and Obama were also linked, at least obliquely, by concerns over the Iraq War. Bush never publicly opposed the Iraq effort, considering his son, President George W. Bush, launched the invasion to topple Saddam Hussein in the aftermath of 9/11.          But Scowcroft in 2002, by then long out of office, wrote an August 2002 Wall Street Journal op-ed, “Don’t Attack Saddam,” which proved prescient in its warnings about the destabilizing effect an attack in Iraq could have on the broader Middle East. The article was largely seen as a proxy for the views of foreign policy realist George H.W. Bush, who was fast friends with Scowcroft, his one-time co-author on a 1998 book about world affairs.          Though Bush was a Republican and Obama a Democrat, their realist view of foreign policy lined up in nonpartisan ways. Obama, of course, was considerably more vocal in his opposition to the Iraq War — it helped propel him to the Senate in 2004 and the presidency four years later.\n",

      "Expert: Visas for China 'Should Be Last Priority' During Coronavirus Crisis\n",
      "Issuing EB-5 investor visas, which primarily benefit Chinese nationals, “should be the last priority” of the United States federal government in the midst of the Chinese coronavirus crisis, Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Jessica Vaughan says. Last week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order slowing green card processing for some foreign nationals trying to enter the U.S. The order authorized the continuation of the EB-5 visa program, which gives out about 10,000 green cards a year on the premise that foreign nationals invest in the U.S. In 2018, nearly half of all EB-5 visas were awarded to Chinese nationals, according to State Department data. In 2017, 75 percent of the visas went to Chinese nationals, and in 2016, 76 percent of the visas went to Chinese nationals. From 2011 to 2015, Chinese nationals accounted for 70 to 84 percent of annual EB-5 visa recipients. Vaughan, in an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriot’s medianame News Tonight, said the EB-5 visa program ought to be last on the administration’s priority list considering it favors China more than most other countries. “It’s basically selling green cards to investors,” Vaughan said. “But the regulations are written in such a way that this program has become a magnet for fraud and simply a way for companies to provide capital to, often, real estate developers for projects … it’s kind of like laundering money.”          “There have been a whole host of scandals … that are security risks as well as just an affront to the integrity of our immigration system,” Vaughan continued. “This should be the last priority for people to come into the country right now, particularly when … the country where this program is most popular is China.”          As medianame News has chronicled, the EB-5 visa is plagued by fraud. In one of the most famous cases, New York City’s giant $25 billion Hudson Yards project on the Upper West Side was funded by EB-5 visa investments even though the program is meant to repair dilapidated and underserved areas. The developer behind the Hudson Yards project “raked in at least $1.2 billion in EB-5 funds for this project,” according to CityLab. “I don’t think there’s ever been a visa program that has experienced so much fraud and corruption within it because of the large sums of money that are changing hands and the value of that green card for people from China,” Vaughan said. “There have been Iranians who have been thought to be actors of the Iranian government taking advantage of this — essentially buying a green card and then U.S. citizenship.”          In the last three years, nearly 30,000 foreign nationals were able to obtain EB-5 visas. The number of EB-5 visas rewarded to Chinese nationals is, in some cases, 40 times the rate at which these green cards were once given out. John Binder is a reporter for medianame News.\n",

      "How Trump just upped the ante with China over trade deal: expert panel\n",
      "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo challenged the Chinese government in a speech on Tuesday, accusing Beijing of \"very significant\" human rights abuses, in what amounted to a new dynamic in U.S.-China relations, according to an expert panel on medianame Nation's \"Deep Dive.\" In a news conference, Pompeo highlighted recent documents detailing how the Chinese government has detained more than a million ethnic minorities, including Uighurs and other Muslims. “These reports are consistent with an overwhelming and growing body of evidence that the Chinese Communist Party is committing human rights violations and abuses against individuals in mass detention,\" Pompeo said. Wall Street Journal editorial page assistant editor James Freeman asked the panel if this public statement will be used as leverage to resolve the 16-month U.S.-China trade war, or as an excuse to drive the two major world economies further apart. \"The answer can be both,\" said Gordon Chang, author of \"The Coming Collapse of China.\" President Trump \"may want a short-term deal to sort of get him through to the election,\" Chang continued. \"But long term, I do believe he wants to bring business back home. He talks about it all the time. He's consistently had his theme on China that goes back well before he was running for president. And disengagement is actually occurring anyway. And it's not just us. It's also the Chinese because they're pushing companies out of China.\" \"And I think that's a good thing for us, because we don't want our companies beholden to a country that is becoming more and more Maoist, more totalitarian, as Pompeo talked about,\" concluded Chang. While acknowledging that it, \"sounds callous\" to discuss the impact of Pompeo's remarks on trade, Freeman asked the panel how investors will view the developments. \"Internally Chinese didn't particularly dislike negotiating with Trump despite the volatility, because he was remaining -- very keyword -- transactional, meaning he's talking business only, not getting in our business about Hong Kong, about Taiwan, about the camps,\" noted D.R. Barton, chief technical strategist for Money Map Press, which is an publication for investors. \"Now that's taken a little bit of a change,\" continued Barton, \"He's starting to put some pressure with the new Civil Rights and Democracy Bill -- those are all different things that can be used for Trump as negotiating ploys.\" China summoned U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad to Beijing on Monday in response to the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in Congress last week. The bill, passed nearly unanimously in the U.S House and Senate, is meant to protect human rights in Hong Kong amid a recent spike in violence in the five-month protest against Chinese control.

      "China state media: George Floyd protests in U.S. a ‘beautiful sight’\n",
      "A Chinese state newspaper called the riots in dozens of U.S. cities “retribution” for Washington’s support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, punctuating rising tensions Sunday between Beijing and President Trump. Mr. Trump has stepped up to the fight and announced that the U.S. is terminating its relationship with the World Health Organization over its handling of China’s role in the coronavirus crisis. He also imposed fresh sanctions on Beijing and Hong Kong officials for their security crackdown on the financial hub. The president disclosed over the weekend that he is working to add India, South Korea, Russia and Australia to the Group of Seven nations’ annual summit. Aides said the move is partly aimed at confronting China’s rising influence. “For the first time, we have a president of the United States who is prepared to push back against [China’s threats] and protect the American people,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday on Fox Business’ “Sunday Morning Futures.”          The Global Times, a newspaper known as a Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, suggested in a column that Beijing would be justified if it openly backed the protests and riots in the U.S. that have prompted eight governors to call out the National Guard. The column, written by Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin, took aim at the Trump administration for threatening to impose sanctions on China over its new security law in Hong Kong. The newspaper also took aim at Mr. Pompeo and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. It mocked a statement Mrs. Pelosi made nearly a year ago that pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong were “a beautiful sight to behold” at the time. “Now, the ‘beautiful sight’ is extending from Hong Kong to over a dozen U.S. states,” the paper said. “U.S. politicians now can enjoy this sight from their own windows.”          The demonstrations and, in many cases violent rioting, began last week in Minneapolis, where George Floyd, a black man, died after a white police officer handcuffed him and knelt directly on his neck for nine minutes. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. “A quick question for Pelosi and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: Should the Chinese government and National People’s Congress issue a statement to support the protests by African-Americans and the grassroots of U.S. society?” Mr. Hu wrote. “It seems to be what Beijing should do according to the logic of Washington cheering for the rioters in Hong Kong.”          Mr. Pompeo implicitly criticized the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping. “It’s a different Chinese Communist Party today than it was 10 years ago,” he said. “This is a Chinese Communist Party that has come to view itself as intent upon the destruction of Western ideals, Western democracies, Western values, and puts Americans at risk,” he said. “The list is long, whether it’s stealing American intellectual property, destroying hundreds and millions of jobs here in the United States, further efforts to put at risk sea lanes in the South China Sea, denying commercial traffic.”          White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said the president’s decision to pull the U.S. out of WHO was designed to force the international organization to end its “reliance on China.”          “We’re going to beat this COVID disease that was unleashed on us and came from China,” Mr. O’Brien said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “But in the meantime, we’re going to take that $440 million that the U.S. spends, compared to the $40 million that the Chinese spend on the WHO, and we’re going to make sure it gets to front-line health care workers.”          Mr. Trump announced Friday that the U.S. was terminating its relationship with WHO over its handling of the coronarvirus crisis and took actions to punish China for misleading the world on the virus and for its security crackdown on Hong Kong. The president also announced he was ending U.S. preferential trade treatment for Hong Kong. He said Hong Kong is no longer a separate territory because Beijing moved to curb its autonomy. “Chinese officials ignored their reporting obligations to the World Health Organization and pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world,” Mr. Trump announced in the White House Rose Garden. “The Chinese government has continually violated its promises to us and so many other nations. These plain facts cannot be overlooked or swept aside.”          Deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 rose to nearly 104,000 on Sunday. Business shutdowns to slow the spread of the coronavirus have thrown roughly 40 million Americans out of work in less than three months. The president said the sudden hardship wrought by the virus was one reason he insisted on attending the first manned space launch in the U.S. in nine years on Saturday in Florida. “It’s such a great inspiration for our country,” Mr. Trump said of the Space X launch. “We think next year is going to be one of the best years we’ve ever had, economically. We suffered something that was terrible. It should have never happened. It should have never come out of China, but it did. They didn’t stop it. They were unable, probably, to stop it.”          The president is imposing sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials who are involved in restricting freedoms in Hong Kong. He also is moving to end Hong Kong’s preferential trading status with the U.S.          “He’s asked us to review every preferential treatment that Hong Kong had and work to eliminate it. It no longer make sense,” Mr. Pompeo said. The administration also is suspending the entry of “certain foreign nationals from China” as potential security risks. The president’s move will affect a small percentage of the approximately 360,000 Chinese students in the U.S., including graduate students and researchers with ties to the Chinese military. The president said Beijing’s crackdown on Hong Kong “is a tragedy for the people of Hong Kong, the people of China and, indeed, the people of the world.”          “China claims it is protecting national security, but the truth is that Hong Kong was secure and prosperous as a free society,” Mr. Trump said. “Beijing’s decision reverses all of that. It extends the reach of China’s invasive state security apparatus into what was formerly a bastion of liberty. China has replaced its promise formula of ‘one country, two systems’ with ‘one country, one system.’”          Rep. Chris Smith, New Jersey Republican and a leading congressional critic of China’s human rights record, said past administrations answered China with “cheap rhetoric” that emboldened its communist rulers. “President Trump, however, is beginning to change that and is doing what previous presidents have failed to do,” Mr. Smith said. “For the sake of oppressed people, the United States — even if we have to go it alone — must impose sanctions.”          The State Department outraged Chinese leaders last week by declaring that U.S. leaders officially assess that Hong Kong no longer has the legal and economic freedom that the Chinese government promised under its treaty with Britain that gave the former colony back to Beijing in 1997. Chinese media accused Mr. Trump of hypocrisy with his sanctions over Hong Kong’s protests. “Trump really had the nerve to make the announcement when a group of furious Washington citizens were storming toward the White House,” the Global Times column said Saturday. “Washington must have failed to anticipate that retribution could come that fast. It should be thinking about it though.”          In classic pro-China propagandist fashion, the Global Times column characterized the U.S. demonstrations as equivalent to protests against Chinese communist authoritarianism that have been rocking Hong Kong in recent years. Hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators have taken to the streets in the territory to push back against the Chinese communist government’s gradual moves to strip the global financial hub of freedoms and governmental autonomy. Citing the clashes in American cities, the Global Times claimed that it is “as if the radical rioters in Hong Kong somehow snuck into the U.S. and created a mess.”          The column suggested that the U.S. protests were a kind of punishment for Mr. Trump over his policy on Hong Kong and said the U.S. political system is “declining” at an “accelerating” rate. It sought to cast the authoritarian communist government in Beijing as superior. “The odds of outbreaks of riots in the U.S. are much higher than they are in China,” it claimed. “How could politicians in Washington possibly define the disturbances in other countries as ‘beautiful sights’ publicly? It is stupid to do so simply because they want to attack China.\n",

      "State of the Union: These notable guests have been invited by lawmakers\n",
      "Some notable guests will be in the House chamber for President Trump's State of the Union Address Tuesday night -- including two anti-Beijing activists hosted by Republican senators that underscore the tension within the Republican party on how to address China. Lawmakers and other officials traditionally are allowed to invite one or more guests to view the president's annual speech to a joint session of Congress. Lawmakers often choose their guests to make political statements, highlight a policy accomplishment or reward an exceptional constituent from their districts. Here are some of the guests that members of Congress are bringing to the Capitol for Trump's address Tuesday night. INFECTIONS FROM CORONAVIRUS EXCEED 20K AS CHINA VOWS NEW MEASURES TO PREVENT SPREAD          Abbas, one of Rubio's two guests, founded the organization \"Campaign for Uighurs,\" which raises awareness of the Chinese government's atrocities against Uighur Muslims. U.S. government officials believe that China has placed anywhere from 800,000 to 2 million Turkic Uighurs in reeducation camps under harsh conditions. Outside the camps, the 11 million Uighurs living in Xinjiang live under constant surveillance and discrimination from the Chinese government. They watch as the Chinese bulldoze through their mosques and, in some cases, their communities. \"Rushan is a leading voice in the defense of Uighurs’ human rights,\" Rubio said of his guest. \"As a result of her work, her sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was believed to have been forcibly disappeared and detained in a camp in Xinjiang. As the Founder and Executive Director of Campaign for Uighurs, Rushan has tirelessly raised awareness of the atrocities taking place in Xinjiang at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.\" Law was elected as a Hong Kong lawmaker at 23 years old before being forced out by the Beijing government. He is now a Yale graduate student and the founding chair of Demosisto, a \"movement-oriented youth activist group in Hong Kong that promoted democracy and progressive values.\" \"Nathan is an inspiration in the fight for freedom and democracy, and he has sent a powerful message to Communist China that the people of Hong Kong will not back down or be silenced,\" Scott said. \"The United States will always stand with fighters like Nathan to rise up against injustice and fight for freedom. We cannot let Communist China and General Secretary Xi continue to silence the people of Hong Kong, and the world must stand together to present a unified front against Communist China’s aggression.\" Scott and Rubio's guests could be seen as a subtle dig against Trump, who has been reluctant to call out the Chinese government on human rights issues as he tries to hammer out a trade deal with the nation. They are hardly the first Republicans to urge a tougher stance on China than the president. Last October, as Trump was congratulating China on its 70th anniversary, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., along with several other Republicans, ripped the communist nation for having \"deprived its citizens of their fundamental human rights and human dignity,\" as Cheney and Gallagher put it in a statement. After her husband John McNamara was one of five journalists for the Capital Gazette, a newspaper based in Annapolis, Md., to be killed in a mass shooting in 2018, Chamblee became a gun control activist. \"This is Gun Violence Survivors Week,\" Chamblee said, according to a press release from Van Hollen. \"It's been 586 days since I watched the survivors of the Annapolis Capital emerge from the death trap that was their workplace, their newsroom. Because of an evil and dangerous man who never should have had easy access to a shotgun, my husband John McNamara was one of five colleagues who never made it out... I'm so grateful for Senator Van Hollen's tireless work to end this nightmare of gun violence.\" Van Hollen panned Congress' lack of action to limit access to guns. \"But since their murders, the Senate has yet to take meaningful action to address gun violence,\" he said. \"From the daily toll of violence in our communities to the mass shootings we’ve seen across the country, it’s past time to act.\" Mendoza's son Brandon was a sergeant in the Mesa Police Department before he was killed in a car crash with an illegal immigrant who was intoxicated. The individual who killed Mendoza had a criminal record in the U.S. and still had not been deported. GUATEMALAN WOMAN DEPORTED AFTER KILLING 4 KIDS IN 2008 BUS CRASH PLEADS GUILTY TO RE-ENTERING US ILLEGALLY          \"Congress’s refusal to secure the border, consistently enforce our immigration laws, and remove incentives for aliens here illegally, has contributed to the deaths of innocent Americans,\" Biggs said in a statement. \"These deaths were preventable, but for our government’s dereliction of duty.\" Wild spent years fighting in court for Epstein victims against the lenient plea deal he received from prosecutors in his early-2000's case in Florida, and a bipartisan group in Congress rewarded her by putting her name on a victims' rights bill aimed at preventing a similar circumstance from happening in the future. \"Courtney’s bravery and dignity in the face of unfathomable treatment by those who should have been fighting for her and the other Epstein survivors, and the resulting miscarriage of justice in that case deserves and demands the nation’s attention,\" Speier said. \"We are standing up for what is right and to ensure that those who continue to subvert the rule of law and those who fail to hold perpetrators responsible for their malign deeds will not succeed.\" His murderers were on orders from Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman, according to an investigation by the CIA. President Trump has been reluctant to acknowledge that Saudi Arabia had a role in killing Khashoggi. \"Hatice’s courage to sit in the House Chamber Tuesday night should serve as a clarion call to the President that no matter how high it goes, Saudi Arabia must be held accountable for the murder of this loving father and fiance, respected journalist, U.S. resident, my constituent, and reformer,” Connolly said. “Congress has acted. Now too must the president.”\n",

      "China summons US ambassador, says US blocks its development\n",
      "BEIJING -- China has accused the U.S. of seeking to obstruct its development with recent steps to sanction officials who undermine local autonomy in Hong Kong, summoning the U.S. ambassador in Beijing to lodge a protest.          Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang told Ambassador Terry Branstad that threatened sanctions and the withdrawal of special trading privileges for Hong Kong are not about democracy and freedom in the semi-autonomous territory but an attempt to contain China's development.          “I want to warn the U.S. sternly that any bullying and unfairness imposed on China by the U.S. will meet resolute counter attack from China and the U.S. attempt to obstruct China’s development is doomed to failure,\" he said, according to an account of Wednesday's meeting carried by state media.          President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act into law on Tuesday, as well as an executive order affirming an earlier decision to eliminate preferential treatment that has been given to Hong Kong, but not mainland China.          The U.S and other Western democracies have grown increasingly concerned over developments in Hong Kong, and in particular China's imposition of a national security law that is seen as a threat to freedom of speech and the right to protest.          At the same time, the Trump administration has challenged China on multiple fronts, treating it as a strategic competitor, an approach that seems only likely to expand as Trump faces a tough battle for re-election this fall.          Zheng told Branstad that the U.S. has also “interfered with China’s internal affairs and harmed China’s interests on the issues of Xinjiang, Tibet and the South China Sea, further exposing its nature of naked hegemony.\"          He urged the U.S. not to go “further and further on the wrong path.”          The U.S. Embassy did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n",

      "Defense Secretary Mark Esper cautions allies against cozying up to China\n",
      "LONDON — Defense Secretary Mark Esper cautioned European allies against cozying up to China, arguing on Friday that Beijing seeks greater global influence by leveraging economic power and stealing technology.          \"The more dependent a country becomes on Chinese investment and trade, the more susceptible they are to coercion and retribution when they act outside of Beijing's wishes,\" Esper said in a speech at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank.          Esper's assertion that China is seeking to expand its influence at the expense of others has been a common U.S. government refrain for years, including during President Obama's administration. By taking this message to London, Esper seemed to be suggesting that Europeans do not fully share U.S. concerns, which often center on China's efforts to militarize disputed territory in the South China Sea and its vast trade surplus with the U.S.          \"I would caution my friends in Europe — this is not a problem in some distant land that does not affect you,\" he said.          In a similar vein, Esper blasted Russia for arms control violations and for aggression in Europe, including its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and what he called Moscow's continued aggression in eastern Ukraine. In a question-and-answer session after his prepared remarks, Esper said Russian ground-based cruise missiles aimed at Europe are \"probably nuclear-tipped.\"          Esper's audience of defense experts and officials was as interested in Middle East issues as in the main topic of his speech. In response to a question about the U.S. approach to Iran, Esper acknowledged differences with some allies but stressed that President Donald Trump is determined to stay on his course of \"maximum pressure\" through economic sanctions.          He said the goal is to compel the Iranians to negotiate an agreement to replace the 2015 nuclear deal, from which Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. last year. Many in Europe consider the U.S. withdrawal a mistake.          Esper said a new nuclear deal would have to assure that Iran \"doesn't pursue or acquire a nuclear weapon not just in 10 or 15 years but forever,\" and he suggested that such talks may be in the offing.          \"It seems in some ways that Iran is inching toward that place where we could have talks,\" he said.          Later at a news conference, British Defense Minister Ben Wallace, with Esper at his side, said he would not predict Iran's intentions toward negotiations but noted that Iran is still holding a British-flagged vessel.          \"We'll take them at their actions rather than their words,\" Wallace said.          Esper, in his prepared remarks, was making the case for the Trump administration's argument that the West must do more to counter what he called efforts by China and Russia to \"disrupt the international order\" to gain advantage.          \"China's technology theft for military gain is staggering,\" Esper said.          It was the first major policy speech by Esper since becoming defense secretary in July. In tone and substance, the remarks showed Esper subscribes to what has become a common theme in Washington, namely that China is the greatest long-term threat to global security.          \"For anyone who wonders what a world dominated by Beijing might look like,\" he said, \"I would argue all you need to do is look at how they treat their own people, within their borders.\"          Esper cited as an example China's treatment of minority Uighurs since the ruling Communist Party in 2016 launched what it calls a campaign against ethnic separatism and religious extremism in the western region of Xinjiang.          An estimated 1 million Uighurs have since been detained in internment camps and prisons across the region, and advocacy groups say that includes more than 400 prominent academics, writers, performers and artists. Critics say the government is targeting intellectuals to dilute or even erase Uighur culture, language and identity.          \"It is increasingly clear that Russia and China want to disrupt the international order by gaining a veto over other nations' economic, diplomatic and security decisions,\" Esper said.          Esper's speech amounted to a statement of his top strategic priority: to make China and Russia the main focus of U.S. defense planning, shifting from the insurgent wars of recent decades in the Middle East and Afghanistan.          However, some defense analysts question whether Esper and the Trump administration have laid the groundwork for such a shift.          \"Changing the strategic direction of a large nation requires a shift in public opinion, and the Pentagon has not done much to make a convincing case to Americans,\" Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense expert at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote this week for Foreign Policy.          Meanwhile, China and Russia have denied the U.S. accusations of malign actions and intentions.          Esper's visit was taking place amid a crisis over Prime Minister Boris Johnson's determination to lead Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31. On Thursday evening, Esper met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n",

      "FBI, DHS warn Chinese hacking threatens the U.S. coronavirus response\n",
      "WASHINGTON — The U.S. government issued a stark and unusual warning Wednesday asserting that China's efforts to hack health care and pharmaceutical companies pose a \"significant threat\" to the nation's response to the coronavirus pandemic.          In a joint statement, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity agency disclosed that the FBI is investigating \"the targeting and compromise of U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research\" by the Chinese military and other Chinese hackers.          \"These actors have been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research,\" the statement said. \"The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options.\"          The FBI urged organizations who suspect suspicious activity to contact their local FBI field office. DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA, said it would release technical details about the malicious attacks in the coming days.          \"The reason we are calling out China in particular now is just because the scale has really amped up,\" a senior FBI official told medianame News, adding that China had stepped up cyber theft \"at this moment of national crisis.\"          China is rushing to be first to develop a coronavirus vaccine, said John Demers, the Justice Department's assistant attorney general for national security.          \"China has long engaged in the theft of biomedical research, and COVID-19 research is the field’s Holy Grail right now,\" he said. \"While its commercial value is of importance, the geopolitical significance of being the first to develop a treatment or vaccine means the Chinese will try to use every tool — both cyber intrusions and insiders — to get it. These actions underscore how China has chosen not to work together to combat this disease. This is sad.\"          Bryan Ware, CISA’s assistant director for cybersecurity, said in a webinar last week that based on classified intelligence collection, “We are seeing a significant increase in espionage activities against vaccine research development. Directed at pharmaceutical companies, directed at laboratories, directed at R&D centers and universities and elsewhere.\"          He added, \"Every country in the world has a national interest in getting that vaccine or antivirals or medications the soonest, the fastest, and should be expected to use all of their espionage resources to steal what they can from the United States.”          Notably absent from the announcement, however, was any indication of what steps the Trump administration plans to take to thwart or deter Chinese hacking, a problem that has bedeviled American and European governments and companies for decades. In 2012, the then-director of the U.S. National Security Agency called Chinese economic espionage \"the greatest transfer of wealth in history.\"          A senior administration official told medianame News that U.S. Cyber Command, the military agency authorized to conduct offensive cyber action, is taking steps to stop state-sponsored Chinese cyber attacks when possible, but the official said the details are classified.          medianame News has previously reported that under Gen. Paul Nakasone, Cyber Command has stepped up its secret hacking of foreign computer networks in an effort to keep China, Russia, Iran and other adversaries on their heels, using terms such as \"persistent engagement\" and \"defending forward\" to describe the activity. Key questions remain unanswered, including whether American military hackers would respond offensively to disable or punish Chinese cyber attacks on private U.S. companies.          On May 6, the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre and the U.S. DHS updated their joint April 8 warning to hospitals and other medical institutions, saying hackers \"may seek to obtain intelligence on national and international health care policy or acquire sensitive data on COVID-19 related research.\"          One tactic cyberattackers are now using against health care institutions is known as \"password spraying,\" according to the advisory. The technique uses a single common word over many users on one network, in the hope that at least one account will be penetrated. The advisory also said outside contractors with access to medical information and research are often targeted.\n",

      "The Chinese Are About to Take Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump to the Cleaners\n",
      "For a good example of how our system of government is in danger of devolving into a quasi-monarchy, consider this: Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, President Trump’s son-in-law and daughter, will be visiting China this fall to lay the groundwork for a subsequent visit by the president himself, who tweeted recently that he has become “very disappointed in China.”          Meanwhile, more than a half-year after the start of the Trump administration, the job of assistant secretary of state for East Asia still lies vacant.          Novices like Kushner and Ivanka Trump typically fall into traps when they try to deal with China. You might call this a form of guidance for them. Alternatively, you might instead call this essay a description of how Beijing will handle them and why their involvement is more likely to set back, rather than help, America’s interests.          I mention the job of assistant secretary of state for East Asia because, ordinarily, the person who holds that job helps to coordinate preparations for a presidential trip to China. Even when the White House runs China policy, as it often does, it’s still the bureaucracy that normally handles the paperwork and the necessary diplomacy that goes along with it.          One example: America’s allies and friends in Asia, such as Japan and South Korea, are always nervous about a presidential trip to China. They fear secret agreements or understandings. They need to be regularly briefed and reassured that their own interests are being taken into account.          In past administrations, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia was often the person responsible for keeping our allies in the loop on our China policy. If no one holds that job, and if Jared is the official responsible for Trump’s visit to China, the likelihood is that the Japanese will ask for regular meetings with Kushner—and they can wait outside his West Wing office in a line that may also include Israelis, Palestinians, Mexicans, tech entrepreneurs, and all the other accounts he holds.          The people who have occupied that East Asia position at the State Department include prominent figures who, for better or worse, left their mark on American foreign policy, from Averill Harriman, Dean Rusk, William Bundy, and Philip Habib in the early years to Richard Holbrooke, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Solomon, Winston Lord, Christopher Hill, and Kurt Campbell more recently. Under Trump, so far: Nobody.          And it is experienced officials who might help Jared and Ivanka to avoid falling for all the standard lines and ploys—the ones that, over the years, China has used to co-opt visitors and to throw them off their negotiating agendas.          All of the analysis and temperature-taking about the weekly ups and downs of Trump’s relations with China thus far have been, in a way, premature. What’s most important, and what Beijing most cares about, is not the first two years of a presidency, but rather the two years (or the six years) afterward, when Americans are paying less attention. China seeks to create a situation in which, over the long run, a president and his White House will essentially give up on the idea of pushing or challenging it too much.          Keep in mind, too, that China’s goal with any new administration is to find one or two top officials, just below the president, to whom it can go with pleas to override whatever the U.S. government is planning to do that Beijing won’t like—be it responses to human-rights abuses, penalties on trade, or countering military actions in the South China Sea.          This is where Kushner and Ivanka come in. Often, the person China chooses as its principal interlocutor in is the national security adviser. (See: Henry Kissinger). But it appears that with the Trump administration, it may be the first son-in-law and first daughter.          Here are just a few the pitches they are likely to get repeatedly in Beijing:          1) You are a friend of China, a lao pengyou (Chinese for “old friend”). OK, this line is such a standard routine that most people have heard it, possibly including Jared and Ivanka themselves. It is meant to convey a sense of obligation—to lay the groundwork for the argument later on that as a friend of China, you will help us with this something or other, or that China will be disappointed if the “old friend” doesn’t come through for it.          2) You are the wise and far-sighted ones. This line is not as well-known as the “old friend” routine, but it is just as common. Jared and Ivanka, if China tells you that you are wise and far-sighted, please know that you are joining many scores of senior American officials who’ve been told the same thing. The implicit message here is that other U.S. officials—say, back in the Pentagon or in the State Department’s human-rights office or the U.S. trade representative’s office who are seeking to take action against China in one way or another—are merely short-sighted pygmies, compared to your supposed wisdom in deciding to overrule them.          3) China is the future. This vague line is more abstract and less personal, but it can sometimes have almost a hypnotic effect on high-level American officials, even presidents. The message is that China is so important that we should forget all our ordinary, day-to-day concerns and our usual rules and standards.          To be sure, China is a huge and powerful country, and yes, it will play an even bigger role in world affairs in the decades to come. The question is not whether China will be important in the future, but what sort of China we want to be dealing with in the future. Do we want to help encourage or perpetuate an authoritarian, mercantilist regime? Will we be better off with China in the coming years if our government suspends the usual principles that we regularly apply in dealing with other countries? Might that not help encourage China to do whatever it wants? And would that be healthy for the United States or for its allies?          I have not yet included here the final, huge source of concern in this situation: Jared and Ivanka and their families have their own huge business interests, including in China, and at least some people in Beijing may try to co-opt or reward them by helping those private interests.​ By way of historical perspective, it was considered a serious potential conflict-of-interest in the 1980s when Prescott Bush, President George H.W. Bush’s brother, started to do business in China. But Prescott Bush was operating on his own, not on behalf of the White House or the American people, and his business interests were extremely small in comparison with those of the Trumps and the Kushners.          I’m sure that Jared and Ivanka think they are obtaining all the guidance they need about China because they have talked from time to time with Henry Kissinger. Yet Kissinger’s judgments on China can turn out to be questionable or self-interested or both.          So if they want to read something stemming from the Kissinger era that would be far more helpful in preparing them, they should turn instead to the classic study Chinese Political Negotiating Behavior, by one of Kissinger’s former aides, the late Richard Solomon.          In it, Solomon gave a detailed description of the techniques China repeatedly uses, from controlling the ambience of meetings to playing dumb or applying pressure tactics.          In his summary, Solomon wrote: “The most distinctive characteristic of Chinese negotiating behavior is the effort to develop and manipulate strong interpersonal relationships with foreign officials…          “The Chinese distrust impersonal or legalistic negotiations. In managing a negotiation, they attempt to identify a sympathetic counterpart official and work to cultivate a personal relationship, a sense of ‘friendship’ and obligation; they then attempt to manipulate feelings of good will, obligation, guilt or dependence to achieve their negotiating objectives.”          Those words would appear to describe the role China envisions for Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. It would be nice to think they will be able to resist the standard Chinese ploys. But I doubt they’re savvy enough.\n",

      "Chinese Fund Backed by Hunter Biden Invested in Technology Used to Surveil Muslims\n",
      "Human Rights Watch released a troubling report about a phone application made by the Chinese government. The app provides law enforcement with easy, daily access to data detailing the religious activity, blood type, and even the amount of electricity used by ethnic minority Muslims living in the western province of Xinjiang. The app relies heavily on facial recognition software supplied by Face++, a division of the Chinese startup Megvii, a relationship that sparked questions in the press for Megvii investors. One of the most prominent of these investors is Alibaba Group Holding, which was co-founded by Jack Ma, the wealthiest Chinese billionaire and an icon for the country’s image of entrepreneurship.          The flurry of media reports this week about Face++, Ma, and the role of the private sector in building China’s increasingly sprawling surveillance state, however, left out another prominent investor in the company: Hunter Biden. The son of the former Vice President Joe Biden has spent much of the last decade building overseas investments and business deals, arrangements that could complicate his father’s bid for the presidency by posing an array of potential conflicts of interest. Hunter Biden’s investment company in China, known as Bohai Harvest RST, has pooled money, largely from state-owned venture capital, to buy or invest in a range of industries in the U.S. and China. Bohai Harvest has put money into an automotive firm, mining companies, and technology ventures, such as Didi Chuxing Technology, one of the largest ride-hailing companies in the world after Uber. (Hunter Biden, Bohai Harvest, and Joe Biden’s presidential campaign did not respond to a request for comment.) In 2017, Bohai Harvest bought into Face++, part of a $460 million haul in the company’s Series C investment round. Bohai Harvest’s website features Face++ in its portfolio of investments. and works with a number of funds to make its various investments, a tangled business structure that has brought Hunter Biden into close proximity to influential Chinese government and business figures, according to a review of Chinese business filings by medianame.          Bohai Harvest relies heavily on an international subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China to finance its investments, referring to itself as an “investment platform under BOC” on its website. The investment fund has also partnered with a subsidiary of HNA Group, a controversial conglomerate that has snapped up investments in a wide range of businesses across the world. As medianame has previously reported, the HNA Group has made unusually extensive efforts to cultivate U.S. officials. The company floated an offer to buy out the hedge fund owned by former White House official Anthony Scaramucci; retained the legal services of Gary Locke, the former U.S. ambassador to China, shortly before his confirmation; and provided financing to a private-equity firm backed by Jeb Bush. HNA Group, notably, also courted Bill Clinton, touting meetings with the former president at philanthropy events hosted by the company. The Bank of China, one of the largest banks in the country, has also made overtures to U.S. political elites. Shortly after the 2016 presidential election, the company added Angela Chao, the sister of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and sister-in-law of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to its board of directors. number of politically connected Americans, Hunter Biden’s investment vehicle in China came as a result of a series of deals struck over the last 10 years. In 2008, in the closing days of that year’s presidential campaign, Hunter Biden deregistered as a lobbyist from Oldaker, Biden and Belair, a Washington, D.C., firm he co-founded alongside William Oldaker, a longtime fundraiser and legal adviser to Joe Biden. The following year, Hunter Biden — along with former Secretary of State John Kerry’s stepson Christopher Heinz; Kerry-Heinz family friend Devon Archer; and former Oldaker partner Eric Schwerin — founded several companies using the name Rosemont Seneca.          In 2014, the partners began setting up operations in China. The “RS” in Bohai Harvest RST stands for Rosemont Seneca, and the “T” stands for Thornton Group. The latter group is an international consulting firm based in Massachusetts that was founded by James Bulger, the son of the longtime Kerry ally and former Massachusetts state Senate President William Bulger. The company, according to the Wall Street Journal, planned to raise $1.5 billion, taking advantage of Shanghai’s free enterprise zone to convert yuan to dollars to be invested in foreign companies. Business registration filings in China list Hunter Biden, Schwerin, and James Bulger as key officials at Bohai Harvest. Last year, author Peter Schweizer criticized the timing of Bohai Harvest’s launch, claiming that the exclusive deal coincided with negotiations between then-Vice President Joe Biden and the Chinese government.          On Wednesday, the New York Times raised similar concerns with the involvement of Hunter Biden in Ukrainian energy company, Burisma Holdings, which added the vice president’s son to the company board in 2014. Rosemont Seneca Bohai financial filings, made public through a separate fraud investigation into Archer, revealed that the energy company paid Hunter Biden as much as $50,000 per month at a time when the U.S. was closely involved in Ukraine’s response to Russian aggression in the region. For his part, Joe Biden has long served as a friendly voice for U.S.-China relations, even before his son’s investment ventures. The elder Biden helped lead Democratic support to passing permanent national trade relations with China. In 2000 remarks in support of the vote, Biden argued that he did not “see the collapse of the American manufacturing economy” as a danger from opening up further trade with China, claiming that an economy “about the size of the Netherlands” could not become “our major economic competitor.” Opening China to further trade, Biden predicted, would create “a path toward ever greater political and economic freedom” for the country’s citizens.\n",

      "Poll: Minnesota Now in Play as Biden Lead Slips to Three\n",
      "A poll released by Emerson College on Tuesday shows presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s lead over President Donald Trump has slipped to three points in the key battleground state of Minnesota.          The Emerson College poll of 733 likely registered voters in Minnesota was conducted between August 8 and 10, and has a margin of error of 3.6 percent, which means the contest between Biden and Trump in the state is currently a statistical tie.          The poll results continue the trend of momentum at both the national and battleground state level in the direction of President Trump, who has significantly narrowed the gap against Biden over the past three weeks.          President Trump narrowly lost Minnesota and its ten electoral college votes in the 2016 presidential election, garnering just 44,000 fewer votes than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.          Minnesota is ground zero of the Black Lives Matter inspired riots and protests that have swept the country since the death of George Floyd during his arrest by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department in May.          A new Emerson College Poll finds Minnesota is competitive again in 2020, with 50% of voters planning on supporting former VP Joe Biden and 47% intending to vote for President Trump. While the race is close, only 3% of voters remain undecided. Of voters who plan to vote by mail, 91% plan to vote for Biden, and of those who plan to vote in person, 68% plan to vote for Trump. President Trump’s approval rating amongst Minnesota voters is slightly underwater, with 46% approval, and 51% disapprove of his job performance, with 3% remaining neutral. Among independent voters, Trump’s approval is at 45% approval, and 47% disapproval. First-term Governor Tim Walz has a more favorable view, with 50% approving of his job performance, 41% disapproving and 9% holding a neutral opinion on the Governor.          The poll also found that incumbent Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) leads former Congressman Jason Lewis (R-MN), who won the Republican primary on Tuesday, by a similar three point margin, 48 percent to 45 percent, which is within the poll’s margin of error.\n",

      "As goes Bernie, so go the Democrats, toward nomination or deadlock\n",
      "Bernie Sanders is the pivot point in the Democrats’ presidential contest. Midway between the first- and second-tier candidates, which camp he joins will determine if this is a two- or a three-candidate race. Without overstatement: As goes Bernie, so go the Democrats — toward a conventional nomination or a deadlocked convention.          Since the first debate over three months ago, the Democratic field has changed a good deal. Overall it has shrunk, internally it has shifted.          Looking at Real Clear Politics’ average (10/15) of national polling, former Vice President Joe Biden still clings to the top spot, despite dropping from 32 to 29 percent. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has leapfrogged into second place, almost doubling from 13 percent to 23 percent. At about five percent, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris lead the second tier, almost all of whom have fallen.          Between these two groups sits Sen. Sanders. Now in third place, Mr. Sanders has been relatively flat, edging down from 16.9 to 15.6 percent — roughly 10 points from each group.          Should Mr. Sanders fall, Ms. Warren would almost certainly benefit. Thus far, Ms. Warren has grown at the expense of Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders, and the second tier. Since Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are on the left, there is neither reason nor evidence his supporters would not go to Ms. Warren.          This would accelerate the current pro-Warren trend and make the contest a two-person race. Once Ms. Warren (or any candidate), consolidates the left’s support, already comprising well over 60 percent of Democrats, Mr. Biden is quickly overwhelmed.          Should Mr. Sanders rise, the Democratic contest changes completely. Such a scenario is neither impossible nor improbable. Mr. Sanders has a loyal and tested base. He was the left’s first standard bearer and is still their most aggressive champion.          Additionally, a Sanders rise need not come directly at Ms. Warren’s expense. It could come from Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren both gaining support as second-tier Democrats withdraw. Should Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders apportion the “other left candidates” approximately 20 percent support, Mr. Sanders would reach roughly 25 percent support and Ms. Warren, roughly 40 percent; Mr. Biden would remain at less than one-third.          In the case of Mr. Sanders falling, the question becomes one of timing. The more quickly it happens, the greater the likelihood that Ms. Warren has time to accumulate the delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot. The longer the duration, the more difficult it becomes as Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden, and potentially others, continue to win delegates, thereby withholding them from Ms. Warren.          In the case of Mr. Sanders rising, there is no mystery. The result would be a chaotic three-way race in which no one reaches the number of delegates needed to win a first ballot nomination.          Already further left than any major party in U.S. presidential election history, a three-way race with Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders splitting the Democratic Party’s left majority would lead it further still, as the two competed for the left’s support. The end-result of a brokered convention would only heighten the chaos, leaving no segment of the Democratic Party pleased, and potentially some unmotivated for November.          The one assurance out of these scenarios is that Mr. Sanders will not quit. He would not in 2016 when he opposed Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party’s consensus choice, from start to finish; he certainly will not for Ms. Warren now.          Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are truly different, representing the old and the new left. Mr. Sanders can argue that he will hold Ms. Warren accountable. That is partly true. Ms. Warren would have every incentive to pivot as early as practicable toward the middle to prepare for the general election, but she will be unable to, so long as Mr. Sanders stays in the race.          In sum, Ms. Warren must beat Mr. Sanders to win. For Democrats it’s a race among the left: Once they coalesce around one candidate, the race will be over — regardless of what Mr. Biden does. The left will therefore decide who wins the nomination, but first they must decide whether Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren wins the left.     • J.T.

      "After Trump acquittal, what’s next?\n",
      "Just because the Senate is about to acquit President Trump of charges Republicans believed never rose to the level of “high crimes and misdemeanors,” don’t think Democrats will raise the white flag of surrender. They (and their media allies) have only just begun.          Next is a campaign to defeat enough of the 23 Republican senators up for re-election and, if possible (it doesn’t look possible, but this is February), keep President Trump from winning re-election.          Democrats have virtually no issues on which to run, except the promise of free stuff — from Elizabeth Warren’s student loan forgiveness plan, which does nothing for those who struggled to pay off their student loans without assistance, to Bernie Sanders’ free Medicare for All.          A new Gallup poll released last week shows how difficult it will be for Democrats.          According to Gallup, 41 percent of Americans “are satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S.” That’s the highest satisfaction level in 15 years. Seventy-two percent of Republicans are satisfied, a number likely to grow if the economy remains strong and there is stability in international affairs. Only 14 percent of Democrats are satisfied. That is likely, in part, because Mr. Trump is racking up success after success without any cooperation from the other party. If Democrats had cooperated on at least some issues (other than the new trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico), they might have been able to legitimately claim some credit, but their opposition to all things Trump and their attempts to undo the results of the 2016 election leaves them out in the political cold.          What is most remarkable about this Gallup poll is that it was taken in the middle of the Senate impeachment trial and in the face of some of the most hostile media coverage any president has ever had to endure in modern times.          According to the conservative Media Research Center, which monitors the broadcast network’s evening news programs, “… evening news coverage of the opening arguments of both sides, found ABC, CBS, and NBC did not live up to the standard they demanded of Republicans. They gave Democrats double the airtime and showered their arguments with mostly praise, while expressing only criticism of the President’s legal team.”          The New York Times and The Washington Post have cast aside any cloak of fairness by going anti-Trump nonstop. Their news coverage, editorials and virtually all of their columnists are constantly looking for new ways to express opposition to and hatred of the president. One advantage for readers is that it is easier to get through those papers because they have become predictable and tiresome.          Democrats may feel good about this as they keep company with their media fellow travelers, but Mr. Trump is newly empowered to take his case for four more years of prosperity and relative peace to the public. Every Democrat running for president would raise taxes, giving more money to Washington, which cannot constrain its spending lust under either party. As taxes rise, so would unemployment because many businesses would no longer be able to afford workers they hired during the economic boom.          Look for more investigations — perhaps additional allegations and articles of impeachment — and more “leaks” from former Trump staffers between now and the election. The only way to stop this is for Republicans to regain a House majority and maintain their majority in the Senate.          Barring an unforeseeable disaster (always a possibility), Mr. Trump is positioned to win re-election, perhaps in a landslide, which will send the left and most of the media into another deep depression.     • Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of “America’s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States” (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).\n",

      "All-Time Low Coronavirus Approval Rating Hurting Trump in Swing States\n",
      "President Donald Trump’s all-time low rating on his handling of the Coronavirus pandemic is threatening his re-election chances by enabling former Vice President Joe Biden to expand the Electoral map, according to polls released by CBS/YouGov on Sunday.          According to an ABC News/Ipsos poll released last week, 67 percent disapprove of the way Trump is “handling the response to the Coronavirus (COVID-19)” while just 33 percent approve. It is Trump’s lowest mark since polling organizations started surveying Coronavirus issues in March.          And these low marks are hurting Trump in critical Sun Belt states that are now Coronavirus hot spots. The CBS/YouGov polls found that Biden leads by Trump by six points in the critical swing state of Florida and is virtually tied with the president in Arizona and Texas.          The polling found that “Biden has made gains in part because most say their state’s efforts to contain the virus are going badly — and the more concerned voters are about risks from the outbreak, the more likely they are to support Biden.”          The polls found that nearly seven-in-10 voters in these states are taking the Coronavirus crisis very seriously, and “nine in 10 Biden backers cite the coronavirus outbreak as a major factor in their vote, more so than the economy.”          Nearly six-in-10 voters in these important states believe their states re-opened too soon, and nearly seven-in-10 voters in these three states think their states re-opened “under pressure from the Trump administration.”          Nationally, ABC/Ipsos found that Trump’s Coronavirus approval rating plummeted because of “plunging support among independents and even waning support among Republicans.”          Just 26 percent of independents approve of Trump’s handling of the Coronavirus pandemic compared to 40 percent in mid-June while “Trump’s disapproval among independents has risen to 73%, up from 59% in the June poll.”          While 90 percent of Republicans approved of his Coronavirus response in mid-June, just 78 percent do now. In addition, according to ABC/Ipsos, Trump’s 22 percent disapproval rating among Republicans now “is a more than two-fold increase from last month.”          Perhaps even more importantly, the poll found that “even white Americans without a college degree, considered to be a core constituency of Trump’s base, are split in their approval of the president’s handling, with 50% disapproving and 49% approving, compared to 42% disapproving and 57% approving in that last poll.”          Trump’s Coronavirus approval rating may be the most important number in predicting the 2020 presidential election.          CNN recently pointed out “just how correlated coronavirus is to feelings about the election right now” and noted that “it’s actually more predictive of voting for” former Vice President Joe Biden “than disapproval of Trump’s job performance.”          In the most recent CNN poll, which found that Biden had a 14-point national lead, “among the voters who said Biden would be better at handling the pandemic, 96% said they’d vote for Biden. Trump took a mere 2% of those voters.” Biden also won “92% of those who disapprove of Trump’s overall job performance. Trump won 3% of those voters.”          As CNN noted, this trend has been consistent in numerous other polls. For instance, a recent Pew Research national poll “found that 52% of voters were confident that Biden could deal with coronavirus. Only 41% said the same about Trump.” Biden had a 10-point lead over Trump in that national poll.\n",

      "Rasmussen Poll Shows 2:1 Support for Hire American over Business First\n",
      "The swing voters who will decide the 2020 election oppose by 2:1 the inflow and hiring of more foreign workers amid the coronavirus crash, according to a May 20-21 poll of 1,250 likely voters by Rasmussen Reports.          Fifty-nine percent of swing voting “moderate” voters and 56 percent of non-GOP, non-Democrat “other” voters agree that it would be “Better for businesses to raise the pay and try harder to recruit non-working Americans even if it causes prices to rise,” the poll says.          In contrast, just 27 percent of moderates and 20 percent of “others” told Rasmussen that it would be “Better for the government to bring in new foreign workers to help keep business costs and prices down.”          The poll arrives as President Donald Trump huddles with his advisers to draft curbs on a variety of visa programs. Trump’s curbs might free up many jobs for the many American graduates who face unemployment and poverty because of the Chinese coronavirus. However, many of Trump’s deputies put business priorities first and so favor the inflow of cheap labor for companies and investors.          Rasmussen also showed that Trump’s rhetoric of “Hire American First” policy is also supported by 73 percent of Republicans and conservatives. Just 16 percent of Republican and conservative voters agree with the business pro-migration strategy.          The “Hire American First” results were slightly muffled when Rasmussen asked about “higher-skill” jobs.          Lobbyists for many business groups insist they need more high skilled immigrants, even though many millions of skilled Americans have been pushed aside by outsourcing. This “high skill” pitch has been effective with legislators, congressional staffers, and journalists — even though many U.S. college graduates are more skilled than the “high skill” migrants demanded by business groups, say Indian migrants and U.S. managers.          Rasmussen asked, “Should Congress increase the number of foreign workers taking higher-skill U.S. jobs or does the country already have enough talented people to train and recruit for most of those jobs?”          Sixty percent of swing-voting “other” and 58 percent of “moderate” likely voters sided with the “Hire American First” pitch by saying, “The country already has enough talented people to train and recruit for most of those jobs.”          Just 23 percent of “other” and 28 percent of “moderates” called for the government to “Increase the number of foreign workers taking higher-skill U.S. jobs.”          But more respondents gave “not sure” answers to the “High Skill” question, suggesting a hidden reserve of “Hire American” voters.          The poll showed that 72 percent of Republicans and 69 percent of conservatives said the country “has enough talented people.” Just 19 percent of Republicans and 23 percent of conservatives urged the government to “increase the number of foreign workers.”          The “Hire American First” option is also strongly supported by two demographics where Trump needs more voters — graduates and suburbanites.          Notably, the poll shows that college graduates want to put American workers first. They responded 56 percent to 31 percent against importing more skilled workers. Suburbanites responded similarly, 59 percent against more skilled workers, and 25 percent in favor of more foreign workers.           The same “Hire American First” skew was also seen in the “raise the pay” question, where graduates split 63 percent to 23 percent, and suburbanites split 64 percent to 2o percent.          The loudest voices in favor of more migration were Democrats and people who earn more than $100,000 per year. For example, 33 percent of Democrats said it is “better for the government to bring in new foreign workers to help keep business costs and prices down.” (54 percent opposed)          Thirty-nine percent of Democrats said they would “increase the number of foreign workers taking higher-skill U.S. jobs.” (46 percent opposed)          Rasmussen polls match other surveys that show that Americans generously want to welcome migrants — but rationally want companies to hire Americans before importing foreign workers, especially in an economic crisis.          These polls show that the public strongly objects to companies hiring foreign workers before American employees. For example, an August 2017 poll reported that 68 percent of Americans oppose companies’ use of H-1B visa workers to outsource U.S.-based jobs that could be held by Americans.          In response, pro-migration business-first groups try to divert public attention away from migration, jobs, and wages.          For example, pro-migration groups commission and publicize skewed polls which prod Americans to voice support for attractive young migrants — such as ‘dreamers’ — or for foreign doctors, and to publicly endorse the 1960s myth that the United States is a nation of immigrants, not a nation of and for Americans.

      "Analysis | Nearly half of Republicans think God wanted Trump to be president\n",
      "It’s an argument that much of the country would seemingly disagree with, given that Trump’s job approval numbers remain low and that he lost the popular vote in 2016. But Sanders was probably expressing a view with which many, if not most, of those watching CBN agreed.          We can say that because Fox News included a question echoing Sanders’s sentiment in its most recent poll. (To be clear, this is not a poll conducted among Fox New viewers but a standard, live-caller political poll.) The pollsters asked Americans whether they believed that God wanted Trump to be president. Most said they didn’t — but a quarter of the country agreed with Sanders.          Unsurprisingly, groups that more strongly support the president were more likely to believe that he has, if not a mandate, then at least the imprimatur of a higher power.          Nearly half of Republicans, 45 percent, believe that God wanted Trump to be president, with another 18 percent indicating that they weren’t sure. More than half of white evangelical Protestants — 55 percent — said that God endorsed Trump. Only 3 in 10 evangelicals said categorically that they didn’t think Trump had God’s explicit support in the election.          There’s been a remarkable surge in the partisan divide among evangelicals over the past decade. In 2009, Pew Research Center found that 63 percent of evangelicals identified as Republican, about 35 percentage points more than the number that identified as Democrat. From 1994 to 2009, the average gap in party identification was about 31 points.          After 2009, that gap widened significantly. Now, 77 percent of evangelicals identify as Republican, a gap of 59 points from those who identify as Democrats.          The Fox poll suggests something else about Trump’s presidency, as noted on Twitter by Bloomberg News’s Steven Dennis: It’s hard to see how Trump could ever lose the support of the quarter of Americans who believe he was chosen by God to serve in his position. Trump’s political base is larger than 25 percent, but that 25 percent — those 45 percent of Republicans — seem unlikely to withdraw their support.          It’s worth highlighting, too, that last part of Sanders’s comments, that Trump “has done a tremendous job in supporting a lot of the things that people of faith really care about.” This is true: Trump has put a pointed focus on issues of importance to the evangelical community, explicitly to cement their political support.\n",

      "Opinion | The unpopular Trump is shrinking the GOP\n",
      "President Trump has two problems. First, public disapproval of the president and a lack of confidence in him are skyrocketing. Second, Republicans’ solace that “at least the GOP is with him” may be misguided.          As for the overall numbers, his disapproval rating hit a new high of 60 percent in the Gallup poll. In the latest Politico-Morning Consult poll, 53 percent of voters think former FBI director James B. Comey is very or somewhat honest. By a margin of 45 percent to 32 percent, voters pick Comey over Trump when it comes to honesty. A strong plurality of voters think Trump fired Comey over the Russia investigation, not due to concerns about his performance (47 percent to 36 percent).          By a large majority, voters disfavor his signature bill, the American Health Care Act (which now he concedes is “mean”!). Big tax cuts for the rich, the heart of his tax plan, are unpopular as well. In short, even if Trump could get back to his agenda, it is not going to find favor with the voters.          As for GOP support, let’s keep in mind a few things. First, he’s a minority president who got only 46.1 percent of the vote. He cannot afford to lose voters; he needs to gain support from independents and even Democrats. Second, the Virginia gubernatorial primary results and generic congressional polling show that Democrats have a decisive advantage when it comes to enthusiasm and engagement. Third, we have the Virginia gubernatorial primary results and in a week we will have the results of Georgia’s 6th Congressional District special election to test the proposition that as the GOP becomes the Party of Trump, it becomes less attractive to a mass of voters who have traditionally considered themselves to be Republicans. A shrunken GOP means losses in 2018, the potential for the House to flip to Democratic control and proceed to impeachment, and the emergence of either a primary challenger to Trump, a third-party movement or an enlarged Democratic Party with GOP defectors.          It is not illogical to conclude that Trump is losing the curious or skeptical voters who were willing to give him the chance given his Democratic opponent in 2016, the perception that he was a successful manager and his image as a less ideologically dogmatic kind of Republican.          Republicans would dearly love to keep running against Hillary Clinton, but she won’t be on the ballot in 2018 or 2020. Trump has proved himself thoroughly incapable of managing the executive branch, so much so that Republicans now try to defend his misconduct by saying he’s new to all this.          The lack of progress on major issues cements the argument that he is less capable than the “stupid” politicians he decried in the campaign. His stumbles on the world stage — getting into spats with allies, pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, inviting trade wars with key partners — reinforce the image of a blunderbuss who is making the United States less respected.          Finally, Trump has jettisoned his populist rhetoric and positions (promise of no tax cuts for the rich and no cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) for a Scrooge-like agenda that would roll back Medicaid, make health insurance more expensive for many who voted for him, and deliver big tax cuts for the rich that would require big cuts in popular programs and would unleash a torrent of red ink.          Ironically, Trump offered the GOP the hope for an expanded GOP, one big enough to reach white, working-class voters. The GOP he now presides over is not only politically dysfunctional and unpopular, but also arguably smaller than the one he took over in 2016. Democrats have a tremendous opportunity if they keep their heads about them, make the case against not just Trump personally but also his Trumpian agenda, and offer their own agenda that is both positive and non-radical.\n",

      "Opinion | Joe Biden is still ahead. But Elizabeth Warren is closing in.\n",
      "A new poll out from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal contains a shocking result: Only 9 percent of Democratic primary voters say they’ve made up their minds about whom they’re going to vote for. Nine percent!          Nevertheless, this and other polls show a race that has a particular shape: Joe Biden is holding, Elizabeth Warren is rising, Bernie Sanders is stuck, and everyone else is struggling or fading.          Depending on which candidate you support, just describing this lay of the land might seem unfair. But so is the entire process. And if you think the horse race distracts from the real issues, please read what I’ve recently written about climate change, health care, national security, immigration, homelessness, gun policy or many other issues.          To repeat, the process is unfair. We don’t choose party nominees based on who’d make the best president. Kamala Harris, for instance, seems like a capable public servant with much to recommend her, but her campaign has been hampered by her inability to offer a guiding theme, a rationale for her candidacy that communicates to voters why she and only she ought to be the nominee. In most polls she’s mired in the single digits. (In the NBC-WSJ poll she gets only 5 percent, down from 13 percent the last time they conducted their survey.)          If you look at charts showing the progression of the race (see here or here), you see that the only candidate with a steady upward trajectory is Warren. While she trails Biden in most polls, she often matches him or even beats him on alternative measures, like which candidates voters are considering or how favorable they feel toward them (see here, for example). Some Iowa polls have shown her ahead there, such as this new Civiqs-Iowa State University poll, which has her at 24 percent and Biden and Sanders both at 16 percent.          And right now, Warren is in the heart of a cycle every candidate yearns for. Reporters on the campaign trail have said for some time that she is the one who generates the most enthusiastic response among voters on the ground. A rise in her poll standing inevitably produces stories about what she’s doing right, stories that get filled with the impressions those reporters have accumulated.          The resulting positive news coverage encourages more Democrats to feel favorably toward her, or at the very least give her a careful look. Which leads to poll numbers that continue to improve, which leads to more positive press coverage, and the cycle goes on.          That cycle is why the perception of momentum is one of the most sought-after commodities in a presidential primary. It makes you look like a winner, encourages undecided voters to consider you more closely, and convinces them that people who share their views are joining your cause.          It’s almost entirely a media-created phenomenon, but like many media-created phenomena, it has real-world effects as the perception becomes reality. And it works in reverse, too: If you look like you’re slipping, reporters start writing stories about what’s going wrong, which makes things look even worse. (Sanders is getting some of that now.)          You might argue that Warren’s ability to get 20,000 people to show up to a rally, not to mention her willingness to spend four hours afterward posing for pictures with supporters, doesn’t mean she’s the one who will prevail in the end, and you wouldn’t necessarily be wrong. But that, too, creates the perception of winning, which can become a reality.          If the race comes to be understood as a contest primarily between Warren and Biden, it makes for the kind of clear contrast we’re all drawn to. One candidate is a moderate while the other’s a liberal; one wants to simply get rid President Trump and return to sane, incremental policy-making, while the other wants ambitious structural change; and so on. It also offers the opportunity to write a story political reporters are very familiar with: “Beer track vs. wine track.”          As Ronald Brownstein explains, Democratic primary contests in the past have often featured one candidate who supposedly appealed more to blue-collar voters and one who appealed more to college-educated professionals. This was always an oversimplification, and it comes with an implicit value judgment, that the beer track candidate is somehow more “authentic” than a candidate who gets support from a bunch of smarty-pantses.          But the two most successful Democrats of the last half-century, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, were both able to win support from Democrats across the class spectrum — eventually, even if it might not have been that way at first. And the Democratic Party is increasingly made up of those with more education: According to Pew Research Center data, 4 in 10 Democrats have college degrees and another 3 in 10 have some college education.          But right now, there is definitely a difference in Warren’s and Biden’s support: Warren is indeed winning among college-educated voters and self-identified liberals, while Biden relies heavily on non-college-educated voters, moderates and African Americans.          The key point to remember, however, is that 9 percent figure the NBC-WSJ poll found. With 91 percent of Democrats still open to changing their minds, almost anything could happen.

      "Exit Poll: Young and liberal, LGBTs are 10 percent of today’s electorate\n",
      "medianame News Exit Poll: Young and liberal, LGBTs are 10 percent of today’s electorate One out of every 10 people voting in today’s presidential primaries identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, according to the medianame News Exit Poll conducted in 12 of the 14 Super Tuesday states across the country. Reflecting changing generational attitudes about sexuality and gender identity, LGBT Democratic voters are substantially younger than today’s electorate as a whole. A third of LGBT people voting on Super Tuesday are younger than 30 years old, while 65 percent of the LGBT voters today are under 45. LGBT Super Tuesday voters are a strikingly liberal group: Exactly half of LGBT voters today call themselves \"very liberal\" and another 30 percent say they are “somewhat liberal.” Just 4 percent of LGBT Democratic voters say they are conservative.          medianame News Exit Poll: Liberals account for more than 6 in 10 Super Tuesday voters Liberal voters are dominating the electorate in Tuesday’s Democratic presidential primaries across the country, according to the medianame News Exit Poll conducted in 12 of the 14 Super Tuesday states. Sixty-two percent of voters in Tuesday's primaries consider themselves liberal. This includes a quarter of voters who describe themselves as “very liberal.” That puts the Super Tuesday electorate ideologically on par with voters in three of the four Democratic presidential contests held thus far: Liberals accounted for more than 60 percent of voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. Last Saturday’s primary in South Carolina featured a more moderate electorate: Liberals accounted for just half of those voters.          Joe Gallagher voted on Super Tuesday for former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary contest, but he's not thrilled about it. \"It's too bad because Bernie is the best candidate probably in 30 years,\" Gallagher, 65, told medianame News after he left a polling center in West Hollywood. \"I really am embarrassed not to vote for him, but I felt like I had no choice.\" Gallagher said he did a lot of research into polling and decided about two months ago that Biden was the most electable Democrat running. His sentiment was shared by other voters around Los Angeles. \"My objective and goal is to get Trump out of office,\" said Tara, 26, who strongly supports Elizabeth Warren. But on Tuesday morning, she too decided to vote for Biden. Tara concluded after talking to friends that the race was quickly becoming one between Biden and Bernie Sanders, and she didn't want to get behind Sanders. \"It took much deliberation, and I'm not so happy,\" Tara said, \"but I think, unfortunately, voting for Warren may be a wasted vote that I don't want to do, even though I love Warren.\" Still, voters like Naz, 41, are sticking with Sanders, a candidate he sees as an antidote to President Donald Trump's policies. \"It's nice to see someone try to take this country to the very far left, since Trump has taken it to the far right, because I think America is too far in the middle,\" Naz explained. \"I think Bernie will take it far left, which will balance out this country a bit.\"          medianame News Exit Poll: In three states, half of Democratic voters say self-funded campaigns are unfair Large shares of Democratic primary voters generally take a negative view of self-funded campaigns by billionaires like Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, according to early results from the medianame News Exit Poll. In the three states where Super Tuesday voters were asked about the issue, about half said it is unfair that candidates can spend unlimited amounts of their own money on their campaigns. This sentiment ranged from 49 percent of Democratic primary voters in Texas and Tennessee to 53 percent in North Carolina. Among the remaining candidates, this issue is front and center for Bloomberg, who has invested $500 million of his own money into his campaign. About three in 10 voters who supported Bloomberg in these states said that candidates spending unlimited amounts of their own money on their campaigns is unfair.          Los Angeles voters see long lines at some polling centers LOS ANGELES — Voters lined up around the block at several locations around the Beverly Grove and West Hollywood neighborhoods in Los Angeles. The city has nearly 1,000 voting centers open around the county, and around a quarter of them were open for early voting in the days leading up to Super Tuesday. But for voters who showed up on primary day, many found lines longer than usual. At one polling center on West Knoll Drive, where about 100 people waited in a line stretching down the block, voters told medianame News that they had waited for nearly 75 minutes to vote. Those casting ballots nearby at Rosewood Avenue Elementary School and Laurel Span School said they had waited 25 to 30 minutes, but several said there usually isn't any wait. Polling workers walked around outside of one location at a recreation center on North Vista Avenue in West Hollywood instructing people waiting in line that they could start filling out their election choices on LAvote.net, then use a QR code once they're inside to print a ballot with their picks already selected. That process is part of a new voting machine setup in Los Angeles County.          medianame News Exit Poll: 1 in 7 Super Tuesday voters won’t pledge to support the Democratic nominee Fourteen percent of those voting in Democratic primaries across the country Tuesday aren’t committing to voting for the party’s nominee in November, according to the medianame News Exit Poll conducted in 12 of the 14 Super Tuesday states. That’s about 1 in 7 voters. As they left the polls, voters were asked if they planned to vote for the Democratic nominee this fall “regardless of who it is.” Supporters of Mike Bloomberg were least likely to pledge to vote Democratic in November: 18 percent of his voters wouldn't commit to the party’s ticket. The most loyal Democratic voters? Supporters of Elizabeth Warren. Ninety-one percent of her voters said they’d support the party’s nominee regardless of who it is.\n",

      "Poll: Clinton now holds 11-point national lead over Trump\n",
      "Hillary Clinton is ahead of Donald Trump by double digits with just over three weeks until Election Day, according to a new national medianame News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted entirely after the second presidential debate. In a four-way race, Democrat Clinton holds an 11-point lead over Republican Trump among likely voters, 48 percent to 37 percent, with Libertarian Gary Johnson at 7 percent and the Green Party’s Jill Stein at 2 percent. In a two-way contest without Johnson and Stein, Clinton is ahead by 10 points, 51 percent to 41 percent. An earlier medianame/WSJ poll — conducted two days after 2005 video surfaced of Trump making vulgar comments to describe kissing and groping women — found Clinton leading by double digits among likely voters. But after another day of polling taken immediately after the Oct. 9 debate, the entire Oct. 8-10 poll showed Clinton’s lead at nine points in the four-way contest (46 percent to 37 percent) and 10 points in a head-to-head race (50 percent to 40 percent). To put Clinton’s current 11-point lead into perspective, Barack Obama beat John McCain by seven points nationally in 2008. And Obama’s margin of victory over Mitt Romney in 2012 was four points. “Donald Trump’s chances of winning this election have faded,” says Democratic pollster Fred Yang of Hart Research Associates, which conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his firm Public Opinion Strategies. “This poll is showing the writing on the wall,” Yang adds. And the Republican McInturff observes that Trump “is in a weaker position than in September,” and that his numbers in the poll don’t align with anyone who has gone on to win a presidential election. Clinton Up By 20 Pts Among Women          Looking inside the numbers of the two-way horse race, Clinton holds a 20-point lead among female voters (55 percent to 35 percent), while Trump is ahead among men by just three points (48 percent to 45 percent). Clinton also has the advantage among African Americans (86 percent to 9 percent), non-white voters (76 percent to 16 percent) and those ages 18-34 (54 percent to 36 percent). Trump, meanwhile, holds the edge among independents (41 percent to 36 percent) and white voters (51 percent to 40 percent). But there is a difference among whites: Those without college degrees prefer Trump by a 56 percent-to-36 percent margin, while those with college degrees break evenly between Trump and Clinton, 45 percent to 45 percent. Access Hollywood video of Trump is the 4th-most recognized story in history of medianame/WSJ poll          As for the 2005 video of Trump talking about women in vulgar and crude terms, 95 percent of voters say they saw, read or heard about that news story – which is the fourth-most recognized story in the history of the medianame/WSJ poll (behind the Orlando terrorist attack, the spread of Ebola in West Africa and the Ebola patient in Dallas). But just 32 percent say that the video disqualifies Trump from being president and believe that he should with withdraw from the race, versus 53 percent who disagree. Additionally in the medianame/WSJ poll, 31 percent of voters said the presidential debates made them more likely to back Hillary Clinton, versus 14 percent who said they made them more likely to support Trump. Fifty-two percent said the debates made no difference. Trump leads (narrowly) on trade, economy; Clinton ahead on being a commander-in-chief and women’s issues          On the issues, more voters say Trump would do a better job protecting America’s interests on trade issues (by 46 percent to 43 percent). And he holds a one-point advantage on dealing with the economy (44 percent say Trump would do a better job, compared with 43 percent who say Clinton would). But Clinton has the advantage on the other issues – making appointments to the Supreme Court (48 percent to 38 percent), changing the country for the better (44 percent to 36 percent), being a good commander-in-chief (52 percent to 32 percent) and dealing with issues of concern to women (67 percent to 17 percent). When it comes to personal characteristics, Clinton leads on having the right temperament to be president (59 percent to 23 percent), while Trump narrowly leads on being honest and straightforward (38 percent to 34 percent). Democrats don’t look as strong down the ballot          Despite Clinton’s double-digit lead over Trump in the presidential race, the medianame/WSJ poll finds a closer contest down the ballot. Forty-six percent of registered voters prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress, while 44 percent want a Republican-controlled Congress. That two-point advantage for Democrats is down from six points in the earlier medianame/WSJ poll (48 percent to 42 percent). Among likely voters in new poll, 47 percent want a Democratic-controlled Congress and 44 percent want a GOP-controlled one. By a 53 percent-to-40 percent margin, the poll also finds registered voters saying they’d be more likely to support a Republican candidate who will be a check and balance to Hillary Clinton and congressional Democrats, versus a Democratic candidate who will help Clinton and Democrats pass their agenda. Finally, the medianame/WSJ poll finds President Obama’s job-approval rating at 53 percent among registered voters, which is up one point from last month. It’s the six-straight month where the president’s rating has been above 50 percent in the poll, and it’s his highest rating since Dec. 2012, after he won re-election four years ago. The medianame/WSJ poll was conducted Oct. 10-13 of 1,000 registered voters – via both cell phones and landline phones – and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points. Among the poll’s 905 likely voters, the margin of error is plus-minus 3.3 percentage points.\n",

      "Pete Buttigieg: I would not have wanted my son on Ukraine board\n",
      "FORT MADISON, Iowa (AP) — Pete Buttigieg says he “would not have wanted to see” his son serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while he was leading anti-corruption efforts in the country, an implicit criticism of the controversy that has ensnared his 2020 Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden.          Hunter Biden’s position on the board of the company Burisma has been a rallying point for Republicans as they try to defend President Donald Trump against impeachment charges over Trump asking Ukraine’s new president to investigate the former vice president and his son while also withholding crucial U.S. military aid.          Buttigieg, the childless mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said in an Associated Press interview Monday that his administration would “do everything we can to prevent even the appearance of a conflict. That’s very important because as we see it can create a lot of complications even when there is no wrongdoing.”          Still, he insisted that the issues raised about Hunter Biden and his father by Trump and his defenders are a diversionary tactic.          “So, I would not have wanted to see that happen,” Buttigieg said when asked how he would have handled a situation like Biden’s. “And at the same time, again, I think this is being used to divert attention from what’s really at stake in the impeachment process. There’s been no allegation, let alone finding of any kind of wrongdoing.”          Biden campaign aides reached on Monday declined to comment on Buttigieg’s remarks.          Buttigieg — well organized in Iowa and New Hampshire, drawing large crowds and leading in polls in both first-voting states — has started to aggressively highlight differences with Biden, even on issues of foreign policy that the former vice president considers his strength, as both men compete for the vital middle of the electorate.          With little more than a month before the first votes in the Democratic nominating fight are cast, candidates are drawing sharper contrasts with one another in field where there is no clear leader.          To be sure, Buttigieg has repeatedly stressed that Biden is not a target in the impeachment proceedings.          “I just think it’s the wrong conversation to be having right now, though, given the spectacular misconduct that we have already seen in facts that are not in dispute, where the only argument to be had is over whether it rises to the level of removal” of Trump from office, Buttigieg said.          Still, Buttigieg, facing criticism from rivals for his scant national and foreign policy experience, has been quick to renew his argument that experience and judgment are separate issues.          Asked Sunday about his familiarity with global affairs, Buttigieg called Biden’s vote as a Delaware senator for the 2002 resolution authorizing military force in Iraq part of “the worst foreign policy decision made by the United States in my lifetime.”          In the wide-ranging AP interview, Buttigieg addressed criticisms of his foreign policy experience given the global challenges that would await a new president.          He has recently stressed more directly his record as an intelligence officer in Afghanistan in 2014, pointedly noting the contrast with Trump’s lack of military service. Working to use his service record and local government background to his advantage, he argued that Washington experience on foreign affairs can be remote from the effects on the ground in communities.          “The experience of being on the ground versus experiencing these things through the perspective of official Washington or legislation on Capitol Hill is different,” he said. “And I’d say that on the ground perspective is especially relevant right now at a time when sometimes the political debate and the debate on TV gets more and more decoupled from that on the ground reality.”          Buttigieg, who is openly gay, is often asked by voters how he would handle being attacked as the Democratic nominee for his sexual identity, a question he typically dismisses by noting he has known bullies throughout his life.          And though he referred to Trump on Sunday at a rally in Fort Madison as a “bully who specializes in identifying your vulnerabilities,” Buttigieg, wrapping up a three-day trip through central and eastern Iowa, stopped short in the interview of suggesting he was expecting Trump to make his sexual identity an issue.          “I don’t possess enough imagination to speculate exactly what forms of creative meanness this president will develop toward me or any fellow Democrat,” he told the AP.          A more predictable attack is coming from within the Democratic presidential field, notably from Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar: the suggestion that the mayor of a city of 102,000 is ill-equipped for the divisive politics of a polarized Washington controlled in part by hard-liner Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.          Buttigieg notes that, as the mayor overseeing a workforce of 1,000 people and a budget of $360 million, he has executive experience many of his rivals lack.          But his competitors have suggested that is not sufficient to take on problems on a global scale and politics that are dramatically more complex and bitter. He said a Democratic president would have a mandate for measures to advance health care, curb climate change and enact gun restrictions.          President Barack Obama, who had served as a U.S. senator, soon found that the solid wall of Republican opposition, led by McConnell, made even modest change fundamentally difficult. Buttigieg said he is not daunted by Obama’s experience.          He promises to staff his White House with savvy legislative aides, but more broadly, he is calling for circumventing McConnell to build public pressure for the issues that enjoy broad bipartisan majorities, larger than 10 years ago, he said.          “It’s not that I don’t understand the ways of official Washington,” he said. “It’s that I don’t accept them.”\n",

      "In the Wall Street Journal, two leaders of political-advocacy group Democrats for Life have an article called “The Democrats Biden Doesn’t Want,” pointing out that, although they’re liberal, their pro-life views have caused the Democratic Party to reject them.          “According to Gallup, roughly 1 in 3 Democrats consider themselves pro-life, but Mr. Biden has made no outreach to us,” write executive director Kristen Day and board member Xavier Bisits. “In fact, top Democrats have gone out of their way to make it clear that we are no longer welcome in the party.”          This is far from the first time that such a complaint has arisen from pro-life Democrats this year alone. At a townhall in late January, Day confronted former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, asking, “Do you want the support of . . . pro-life Democratic voters? There are about 21 million of us. And if so, would you support more-moderate platform language in the Democratic Party to ensure that the party of diversity, of inclusion, really does include everybody?”          Buttigieg offered a lengthy, equivocating reply, but the gist of his response was, essentially, “Take a hike.”          Shortly thereafter, asked about whether there was room for pro-life Democrats in his vision of the party, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders declared that “being pro-choice is an absolutely essential part of being a Democrat.”          When Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar told Meghan McCain on The View that “there are pro-life Democrats, and they are part of our party,” and argued that Democrats “need to build a big tent [and] bring people in instead of shutting them out,” she faced extensive criticism from the left. And Klobuchar’s concession was, of course, mere rhetoric; on abortion policy she is nearly as liberal as her competitors, gesturing only vaguely at the possibility of limiting some abortions in the last three months of pregnancy.          Day and Bisits, then, have a point. Biden, the party’s presumptive nominee, has shown little interest in appealing to pro-lifers, despite having spent decades touting his Catholic roots and calling himself anti-abortion. Instead of moderating on the issue to reach centrists, he has moved further to the left in response to pressure from progressives.          Last summer, he renounced his decades of support for the Hyde amendment, which prevents federal Medicaid spending from directly reimbursing for elective abortions. His latest overture in the culture war was vowing to require all religious employers, including Catholic nuns, to be complicit in funding abortion-inducing emergency contraceptives for employees.          Day and Bisits have a point when they write, “America’s 21 million pro-life Democrats face a choice between staying home, risking four more years of Donald Trump’s destructive agenda, and voting for Joe Biden, a candidate who snubs us and our values. We would love to vote for Mr. Biden, but if he wants our vote, he will have to earn it. And if he can’t earn it, he should at least ask for it.”\n",

      "Pete Buttigieg Is Not Intersectional Enough\n",
      "He’s way too bourgeois to suit some hardcore queer activists.          Last Friday, a group of disgruntled “queer activists” interrupted Pete Buttigieg’s campaign event in San Francisco. One of the protesters, Adiel Pollydore, told the Guardian that she decided to protest in part because “Pete Buttigieg represents a very small percentage of the experiences of queer and trans people in this country, being white and being cisgender and being a man, being someone who is highly educated. We know queer and trans folks of color, especially black queer and trans folks, live at the intersection of so many systems of oppression in this country.”          We would not want the “highly educated” speaking on Ms. Pollydore’s behalf.          The protester’s objection to Buttigieg’s melanin count and intact genitalia — “Why aren’t you a trans black woman, Mr. Mayor?” — highlights an ongoing debate on the left about the former mayor’s sexuality, and whether he is, in the words of Masha Gessen of The New Yorker, “gay enough” to represent the LGBT community.          One would think Buttigieg’s gay bona fides are obvious. He is “married” to another man, and frequently drones on about how Mike Pence “hates” him for his sexual preferences. Buttigieg is nevertheless accused of lacking a metaphysical “gayness,” one that obtains not by participation in certain sex acts but instead through the approval of the identity eunuchs in the commentariat and American sociology departments. The operative question, then, is not whether Pete Buttigieg is a homosexual — that much is beyond dispute — but instead whether he is gay, or “gay enough.”          Gessen attempted to explain the contempt “some queer people” hold for Mayor Pete, who they doubt “is gay enough” to represent their political interests. What the mayor’s relative “gayness” has to do with his aptitude as a political vessel for the interests of “queer people” is unclear, as is her operative definition of “gay.” Gessen nevertheless proceeds with an empiricist’s certainty, picking apart moments in Buttigieg’s life and asserting that “the notion that some of us think that Buttigieg is not gay enough has an identifiable relationship to the facts.”          Unlike those who are noticeably “queer,” Gessen argues, Pete Buttigieg has always appeared relatively normal (he can “pass” as a straight man) and therefore could “choose the circumstances and timing of his coming out.” This experience, in turn, led him to adopt a political platform that — in Gessen’s telling — is “profoundly, essentially conservative.” She concludes that Pete Buttigieg’s life experience and ideological commitments make him “a straight politician in a gay man’s body.”          It’s difficult to think of a sense in which a candidate who supports unfettered abortion access, compelling religious business owners to violate their consciences, abolishing the Electoral College, reengineering the Supreme Court, decriminalizing illicit border crossings, granting amnesty to more than 11 million illegal aliens, and banning all new fracking ventures might be understood to be “profoundly, essentially conservative.”          Gessen defends characterizing Buttigieg as “conservative” by citing his aversion to “revolutionary change,” a posture that signals to straight people that “we are just like you, and all we want is the right to have what you have: marriage, children, a house with a picket fence, and the right to serve in the military.” His refusal to embrace “revolutionary change”— a pars pro toto of his rejection of the gay “separatist” politics described by Andrew Sullivan — makes Buttigieg, in Gessen’s telling, “an easy and reassuring choice for these older, white, straight people, and a disturbing possibility for the queer people who seem to be criticizing him for not being gay enough.”          One is reminded of Anthony Kennedy’s famous ex cathedra decree that one “would misunderstand” the Obergefell plaintiffs “to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves.” Ultimately, he said, they “ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law.” The Court was advancing a fundamentally progressive suggestion at the time of Obergefell — at stake was the heretofore unchanged definition of a bimillennial institution — and within five years of Kennedy’s paean, Masha Gessen considers the Obergefell “ask” a sign of dyed-in-the-wool conservatism.          All of Gessen’s argument could, in earnest, be reduced to “Pete Buttigieg isn’t really gay because he doesn’t agree with me about politics.” That implication is clear enough in the “straight politician in a gay man’s body” quip, suggesting that gay men are authentically gay only if they hew to the political program prescribed by Masha Gessen. I do not, for what it’s worth, think much of “authentic gayness” — as moral lodestars go, I prefer the Pauline epistles to the fleeting approbation of a New Yorker columnist; chacun à son goût — but to the sort of person who suggests that Buttigieg is “not gay enough” to earn their vote, I echo the question recorded by the evangelist: What lackest he yet?\n",

      "Buttigieg defends using 'personal struggle' as gay man as 'motivation' to protect other civil rights\n",
      "ATLANTA — Pete Buttigieg stood by his attempts during the fifth Democratic primary debate to identify with civil rights struggles by evoking discrimination he has faced as a gay man.          \"This is a time for solidarity, and anyone who has experienced whatever personal struggle we bring to this fight needs to reach into that as a motivation to help others,\" the South Bend, Indiana, mayor, 37, said Thursday at a voter rights post-debate event with Stacey Abrams' Fair Fight Action group in Atlanta.          Rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, such as California Sen. Kamala Harris, one of the few black candidates in the race, criticized Buttigieg's comments as \"naive.\"          \"What he did on the stage, it's just not productive,\" Harris, 55, said Thursday at her own \"Black Women Power Breakfast\" campaign stop in Atlanta.          During the debate, Buttigieg countered digs over his inability so far to connect with black voters by saying he welcomed \"the challenge\" of introducing himself to those who did not know him yet.          \"While I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news, and seeing my own rights come up for debate,\" Buttigieg said at Tyler Perry Studios. \"And seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me, working side-by-side, shoulder-to-shoulder, making it possible for me to be standing here, wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn't have happened two elections ago, lets me know how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.\"          Although Buttigieg, who married his husband Chasten, 30, in 2018, is performing well in majority-white, early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, a Quinnipiac University poll released last week reinforced scrutiny he has received for his lack of appeal with black Democrats, registering less than 1% support. The voting bloc is crucial for the party to restore former President Barack Obama's coalition, at least in part, and win back the White House next year.\n",

      "Mayor Pete gains traction: Iowa poll finds Buttigieg in second place behind Warren\n",
      "Pete Buttigieg surged to second place in a poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers, ahead of Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.          The Iowa State University/Civiqs poll released Thursday found 20% said Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was their first choice in the Democratic primary, while Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren led the field with 28% support. Sanders was in third place with 18% and Biden in fourth at 12%. Buttigieg jumped 7 points from the September Iowa State University/Civiqs poll, when he was in fourth place.          “You can attribute some of his momentum to basic retail politics,\" said Dave Peterson, an Iowa State professor who organized the poll. \"Buttigieg is incredibly well organized and is spending a lot of resources in Iowa. His presence at the Iowa Steak Fry last month was better than any other candidate.\"          The poll surveyed a set of 598 individuals used in previous Iowa State University/Civiqs polls and has a margin of error of 5%. The poll took place Oct. 18-22.          A RealClearPolitics average of Democratic presidential primary polls in Iowa also shows Buttigieg gaining support. He is in third place with 15.8% in the average, behind Warren and Biden, up from 11.3% in fourth place a month ago and fifth place with 7.5% two months ago.          The Iowa State/Civiqs poll is a particular blow to Biden, who has spent considerable time campaigning in Iowa, the first-voting state. Biden began campaigning in the state in 1987, during his first of three presidential bids.\n",

      "Who spoke the most during tonight's debate\n",
      "Pete Buttigieg defend his level of experience on Wednesday in contentious exchanges with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, using the debate to argue “Washington experience is not the only experience that matters.”          The most contentious point of Buttigieg’s defense came when the mayor said, “There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country.”          Buttigieg’s experience – he leads a city of just over 100,000 people, has only ever been elected by a few voters thousand and lost his only statewide election – has been a central question about his candidacy. And it was clear on Wednesday that his competitors came into the debate looking to questions his qualifications.          When Buttigieg mentioned voting rights, Klobuchar jumped in and said the issue is a “good example of where (Buttigieg) has said the right words” but not followed it up with action and called the mayor a “local official.”          “I have actually done this work,” Klobuchar said.          “Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,” he said, nodding not only his time as mayor, but his experience as a war veteran.          “I would submit that this is the kind of experience we need, not just to go to Washington, but to change it before it is too late,” Buttigieg said.          Then Gabbard jumped and said Buttigieg showed a lack of judgment when he suggested using the U.S. military to help combat cartel violence along the border for security cooperation.          “That is outlandish, even by the standards of today’s politics, Buttigieg responded. “Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico? … I’m talking about building alliances.”          The mayor then hit Gabbard for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.          “Let’s also talk about judgment. One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al-Assad,” Buttigieg said.          Gabbard responded by noting how past leaders met with opposing leaders, citing when President John F. Kennedy met with Soviet Union Premier Nikita Khrushchev and former President Franklin Roosevelt met with Russian leader Joseph Stalin.          Buttigieg interrupted, “Like Donald Trump who met with Kim,” a nod to North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un.\n",

      "Why Democratic candidates like Buttigieg keep failing to usher in the \"Christian left\"\n",
      "For some Democratic voters, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg ticks all the boxes for the kind of progressive who could unite our divided nation: He’s young, educated, gay, and a former member of the military, and has experience in both the private and public sector.          He also speaks openly about his Christian faith. While noting his commitment to the separation of church and state, Buttigieg has said progressives and Democrats “need to not be afraid to invoke arguments that are convincing on why Christian faith is going to point you in a progressive direction.”          Having a progressive presidential candidate place their faith so squarely at the fore offers many liberal and Democrat-voting Christians the opportunity to more openly embrace their beliefs and progressive politics. It saves them from the embarrassment that such a significant number of white Christians voted for Donald Trump’s presidency. It also allows them to use their faith to highlight the hypocrisy of the religious right.          The early attention Buttigieg has garnered has pundits and analysts wondering if we’re witnessing a rise in the “religious left,” a religiously motivated political bloc analogous to the religious right.          Does Buttigieg’s candidacy signal that progressive Christians are forming a political coalition capable of wielding power like their conservative counterparts? If so, it’d be the reversal of a two-decade-long trend.          A recent Gallup poll documenting the overall decline in US church membership over the past 20 years reveals that membership among Democrats dropped sharply from 71 percent to 48 percent, while among Republicans it only declined from 77 percent to 69 percent. Perhaps a candidate like Buttigieg could reinvigorate Christian Democrats. As a Baptist pastor who considers myself a religious leftist, I’m fascinated by this possibility. But I have my doubts.          In fact, thus far in Buttigieg’s campaign, I’m having a hard time determining what actually constitute his religious beliefs, in much the same way that I struggle to understand his stances on issues like health care, student debt, or income inequality. On both, he provides just enough by way of vague platitudes to find something to agree with, but few details on what he actually wants to implement.          Last week, Buttigieg finally unveiled a more fully fleshed-out issues page with a slate of policy recommendations that help clarify his views. Some, like a Medicare buy-in as a way toward universal coverage, are concrete suggestions, but much of it remains frustratingly hazy. One policy description simply states “confront student debt.”          Similarly, regarding religion, he told the Post, “I think there’s an opportunity hopefully for religion to be not so much used as a cudgel but invoked as a way of calling us to higher values.” He also said that “the gospel is so much about inclusion and decency and humility and care for the least among us.” What Buttigieg often says about his religious convictions certainly sounds true, but it also leaves a good deal to the imagination as to what those convictions look like when translated into action. I definitely have a hard time imagining them exciting left-leaning Christians or pulling others from the right to a more progressive political agenda.          What worries me is the way Buttigieg’s brand of Christian leftism plays into the hands of the religious right. For decades, their pastors, theologians, and politicians have preached and organized around a theology that connects the everyday, moral struggles of millions of believers with a larger political struggle — one that proclaims that God wants to transform and save not only their souls but the soul of a nation.          The language of spiritual and moral strife animates the religious right          I recently attended a local Southern Baptist megachurch worship service one Sunday morning. Knowing the overwhelming support for Trump among white evangelicals, those on the outside might expect patriotism and right-wing political propaganda to saturate the morning’s sermon.          Instead, I was surprised at how so much of the messaging dealt with personal and moral struggle and emotions like anger, guilt, desire, jealousy, worry, and sadness. The pastor handled these not merely as slight personal defects, but as the real ways that people experience suffering and destruction in their lives. He wanted people to think about how to live as a better person, partner, friend, and worker and told them that God gave them the power to do it. He used a language of moral striving and struggle that I rarely hear in more theologically and politically liberal churches.          The pastor I heard that morning was J.D. Greear, the recently elected president of the Southern Baptist Convention, their youngest in 40 years. Knowing that so many white evangelicals voted for Trump, I looked up what he had to say prior to the 2016 election.          In two blog posts, Greear carefully avoids explicit partisanship, instead claiming Christians have a moral duty to vote and that particular issues ought to inform who they vote for: abortion, religious liberty, individual responsibility, and recognition of marriage as between a man and a woman, to name a few. While he says neither party has a lock on these policy positions, he makes specific mention of ways Democrats have sought to undermine many of them; his criticism of Donald Trump rests primarily on his character. I didn’t have a hard time seeing which critique white evangelicals prioritized when they voted in 2016.          One need not agree with their particular moral framework or vision (I certainly do not) to appreciate the force of their message: one of individuals and the larger nation striving for moral redemption. That’s a compelling narrative that often goes unnoticed by Christians of the left. It’s not a holy war battle but a collective struggle to be better according to a particular moral framework.          Buttigieg is correct when he says religion gives us higher ideal values that we might attain, but he seems to have no grasp that the acquisition of values entails struggle against the forces, institutions, and people that threaten to impede their acquisition. The religious right understands this. His lack of clarity around policy leaves Christians with little understanding of how a political movement matters to the transformation of their lives. It’s this language of struggle for power, both individual and collective, that anything worthy of the “religious left” moniker will have to adopt if it’s to gain a foothold in people’s lives.          Progressive Christians have taken a stand before          Several articles about Buttigieg’s religious left bona fides have made mention of his affinity to the “Social Gospel,” with Temple University professor David Maslin making the connection explicit by claiming Buttigieg is bringing values from this early-20th-century movement into the early 21st. The Social Gospel was a theological viewpoint that developed during the Gilded Age — amid the drastic inequality of the early 1900s, ministers had to find a way to speak to the working people of their congregation.          In his book Union Made, historian Heath Carter tells the story of the Social Gospel’s development in Chicago at the height of the conflicts between working people and their capitalist bosses. With both sides regularly clashing, Chicago ministers found themselves in a difficult spot: how to walk the delicate balance between the owners and captains of industry that financed their churches, and the working people they hoped to reach. Each group wanted to know what side the ministers stood on.          Many ministers sided with the owners, resulting in the loss of workers in their pews. Those workers did not, however, leave the religion for good, but instead joined other churches where they could work out the ways that their faith empowered collective movement against their bosses. Theologians at the time, like the Baptist minister Walter Rauschenbusch, then gave a theological understanding to the ongoing struggles of these working Christians against the Gilded Age robber barons. That perspective became known as the Social Gospel.          In his now-classic text Christianity and the Social Crisis, Rauschenbusch identifies the roots of the crisis as the clash between two distinct social strata, a working class and an owning class. Inequality between those two classes poses an imminent threat to democracy and equality. The wealthy class attempts to use their unequal power to shape legislation to further their own interests; the working class can only struggle together to overcome them. He writes, “These are two distinct classes, and no rhetoric can make them equal.” For Rauschenbusch and others in the Social Gospel movement, the problem of inequality animates a struggle, informed by their faith, for equality.          Which side are you on?          Buttigieg seems to recognize this incompatibility between the antagonisms of capitalism and a more cooperative spirit of Christianity. In an interview with medianame’s Zack Beauchamp, he said, “there’s tension between capitalism and democracy, and negotiating that tension is probably the biggest challenge for America right now.”          However, unlike the Chicago workers and Rauchenbusch, Buttigieg’s religion compels him only to identify a tension, not an incompatibility, and to say that a healthy capitalism remains possible so long as it’s one that operates within the rule of law. For Buttigieg, the antagonisms of class need to be not overcome through struggle, but contained and managed by sound leadership.          Buttigieg has said that his Christian faith encourages a “skepticism of the wealthy and the powerful and the established.” But one might rightly suspect the strength of his commitment to that skepticism. Based on a recent medianame report, it wasn’t nearly strong enough to keep him from bouncing around to a number of fundraisers hosted by wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. It wasn’t strong enough to prevent him from ushering in gentrification in South Bend in the name of “revitalization.”          Buttigieg’s invocation of his faith might enliven a small number of progressive Christians in the party, but his politics remains standard fare for Democratic politicians courting the whims of the wealthy while attempting to appeal to the masses’ religious values. His political religious vision elides struggle and, in turn, victory.          When I look at my congregation, I see families struggling not just with their devotion to God but devotion to paying their bills. I see older people on the brink of economic collapse because of rising health care costs. I see teachers going on strike to earn a raise. They each, in their own ways, live as victims of a capitalist system.          They don’t want to talk about values so much as they want to know that their religion has something to say about the struggle for health care, housing, a good wage, and a little more control over their lives. More often than not, they know what class they are a part of and who benefits from their misery, and they can tell which side a politician falls on no matter what their religious rhetoric says.          In 1910, during the clashes between working people and their bosses, Rev. Austin Hunter made this observation about the decline in church attendance: “The reason why workingmen are not found in larger numbers in the church is not due to the coldness of the church, nor to the dress parade, but primarily to the fact that the church has more often been on the side of capital than upon the side of labor.” Roughly a century later, with inequality higher than it’s been since Hunter’s words, his statement feels particularly pertinent for Christians, pastors, and politicians.          If there is to be a religious left, it will not be founded by answering the question, “Are you skeptical of the rich?” But: “Which side are you on?”          First Person is medianame’s home for compelling, provocative narrative essays.

      "Pete Buttigieg claims victory in Iowa before the results are in\n",
      "Pete Buttigieg took a victory lap after the Iowa caucuses on Monday — even though he hasn’t yet won them.          The Iowa outcome has been delayed due to a series of technical glitches and missteps by the Iowa Democratic Party that include trouble with a new app it’s using to calculate and report results at precincts across the state. That development put candidates in a bind: Generally, you give a speech at the end of the night and comment on the outcome. There was no outcome to comment on, but many of the candidates gave a speech anyway — including the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor.          “So, we don’t know all the results,” Buttigieg told a crowd of supporters at Drake University in Des Moines, acknowledging the awkwardness of the situation. “But we know, by the time it’s all said and done, Iowa, you have shocked the nation.”          He said his caucus performance, while still unconfirmed, meant “an improbable hope became an undeniable reality.”          We still don’t know how the results shook out, but Buttigieg’s campaign released a memo and precinct-level data to back up their claims that the evening went well for him. His campaign said its precinct captains had reported full results for about 75 percent of the total precincts in the state, and estimated he had come away with 28 percent of the “state delegate equivalents” from the reported precincts. “Our data shows that Pete built a coalition that proves he is the best positioned to beat Donald Trump,” the memo reads.          It is true that Buttigieg probably got delegates in Iowa, a first for an openly gay presidential candidate, which is historic in itself. But it’s also true that we really do not know the Iowa results, and there’s no guarantee he won. Bernie Sanders, who was leading the Iowa polls ahead of caucus night, also struck a victorious tone in his speech.          A campaign spokesperson declined to comment on Buttigieg’s speech and the events of the evening and referred medianame to the memo.          As he took to the campaign trail in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Buttigieg maintained his optimistic tone, despite the uncertainty over the Iowa results. “Everything we know is extremely encouraging,” he told Jim Donchess, the mayor of Nashua, New Hampshire, who endorsed him on Tuesday morning.          “Although that glitch or whatever that caused this,” Donchess said.          “It is frustrating, but —” Buttigieg said before Donchess cut in and said the New Hampshire primary results should be more clear-cut. One would hope.          Buttigieg declaring himself the winner before actually winning was met with skepticism in some corners. And, predictably, his move sparked some backlash on Twitter and questions from reporters.          Sure, it’s good to be confident, but it’s also probably wise to wait until the results are in before you declare victory.\n",

      "Loathing in Las Vegas: Amy and Pete’s resentment boils over\n",
      "After the Minnesota senator defended her “momentary forgetfulness” when she failed to name the president of Mexico in a recent Telemundo interview, Buttigieg leaped in, surely thinking of the criticism he’s taken from Klobuchar in recent debates.          “You’re staking your candidacy on your Washington experience. You’re on the committee that oversees border security. You’re on the committee that does trade,” Buttigieg said, turning to face Klobuchar just to his left on the stage. “You’re literally in part of the committee that’s overseeing these things and were not able to speak to literally the first thing about the politics of the country to our south.”          “Are you trying to say that I’m dumb? Or are you mocking me here, Pete?” Klobuchar shot back.          It exploded again when Buttigieg blasted Klobuchar on her vote to confirm President Donald Trump’s nominee for Customs and Border Patrol, who “was part of family separation policy,” Buttigieg said.          “I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete,” Klobuchar said. “But let me tell you what it’s like to be in the arena.”          It’s clear that the fury is rooted in the personal as well as the political for the two Democratic campaigners.          Politically, Buttigieg and Klobuchar are both hawking middle-of-the-road, tell-it-like-it-is personas, which they argue Democrats need to carry the Midwest, the region they call home. They are both competing to emerge as the main moderate alternative to Bernie Sanders, the current polling frontrunner.          But the rivalry runs deeper than their political positioning. Klobuchar has regularly spoken about sexism on the campaign trail, explaining that she is willing to call out “double standards” for female candidates because “we have to grapple with the fact that some people think a woman can’t win” against Trump, she told POLITICO in January. And this fall, Klobuchar said that a woman with the former mayor of South Bend’s resume and qualifications would likely not be on the presidential debate stage or get treated as a serious national candidate.          Klobuchar’s frustration with Buttigieg bubbles up most intensely when it comes to that experience.          Buttigieg, who served eight years as mayor of a 100,000-person city, is an up-and-coming candidate who quickly scaled the political ladder. For reference, Klobuchar served eight years as Hennepin County attorney and then another 12 years as a senator from Minnesota before she launched her presidential bid.          And while Klobuchar struggled to break out of the primary pack last fall, her fellow Midwestern colleague surged in Iowa and ultimately jumped into a tight battle for first place in the delegate count from the first caucus state earlier this month.          Klobuchar has hit Buttigieg hard before, accusing him of mocking the “hundred years of experience” represented on Democrats’ December debate stage and adding that she hasn’t “denigrated your experience as a local official.”          But Klobuchar often kept her criticisms narrowly focused on Buttigieg's lack of experience, a clear area of contrast between the two. Instead, on Wednesday night, Klobuchar hit out not only at Buttigieg’s experience but at his core principles.          When Buttigieg questioned her votes for Trump nominees, the moderators tried to cut Klobuchar short, but she cut back in as Buttigieg snapped back.          “You know what, Pete? If you could let me finish, since I’ve been in the arena,” Klobuchar said, rattling off the list of bipartisan efforts she worked on to address the immigration crisis. “You have not been in the arena doing that work. You’ve memorized a bunch of talking points.”          Buttigieg returned to his point that “you don’t have to be in Washington to matter.”          “I’m used to senators telling mayors that senators are more important than mayors, but this is the arena too,” he said. “You don’t have to be on Capitol Hill for your work to be significant.”          Klobuchar acknowledged the confrontation with Buttigieg was “personal” in an interview with MSNBC following the debate, calling the former mayor’s attacks “quite obvious.”          “We are surging,” said Klobuchar, who came in a surprise third-place finish in New Hampshire, behind Sanders and Buttigieg. “I think Pete decided he’s going to try to go after me.”          On Wednesday, the tensest exchange between Buttigieg and Klobuchar may have produced a different winner entirely: Elizabeth Warren, whose recent slide in the polls has appeared to benefit both Midwestern candidates. After Buttigieg and Klobuchar tangled over the Mexican president’s name, Warren jumped in to defend her Senate colleague.          “Can I just defend Senator Klobuchar for a minute? This is not right. I understand she forgot a name,” Warren said to applause. “It happens. It happens to everybody on this stage.”\n",

      "Buttigieg visits Morehouse College in effort to build black support\n",
      "ATLANTA — Pete Buttigieg will speak at historically black Morehouse College in Atlanta on Monday as he tries to expand his appeal among black voters who are critical to winning the Democratic presidential primary. The 37-year-old white mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is gaining momentum in the overwhelmingly white early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. But unless his campaign can broaden its reach to minorities, he could stall in more diverse states such as Nevada and South Carolina. Buttigieg has spent recent weeks reaching out to black Democratic figures, from well-known senior leaders to city and community level activists, and gets high marks for being an attentive listener. But the pressure is building to demonstrate he can win over black voters, who for now have largely sided with former Vice President Joe Biden. “I applaud his efforts” to “build out his coalition,” said Nikema Williams, the first black woman to become Georgia Democratic Party chairwoman. Still, she said, he “has a lot of work to do.”          That makes his appearance at the historically black, all-male Morehouse especially important. Buttigieg plans to unveil a post-secondary education plan that would, among other things, dedicate $50 million to Morehouse and other HBCUs. Buttigieg has risen into the top tier in Iowa, which hosts 2020’s first presidential caucuses, challenging his better-known rivals Elizabeth Warren, Biden and Bernie Sanders. Polls show similar traction for him in New Hampshire, home of the first 2020 primary and where he has built a robust campaign organization and traveled regularly in recent weeks. Warren and Sanders are also struggling to woo black voters away from Biden. Buttigieg has talked about systemic racism on the campaign trail and the debate stage, and unveiled a lengthy plan this summer aimed specifically at redressing generations of inequality in areas ranging from education to housing to health care. Buttigieg has spoken about his Douglass Plan — named for abolitionist Frederick Douglass — in front of white and minority communities. But since entering the national spotlight, Buttigieg has drawn attention for his handling of race issues as mayor of South Bend, which has a black population of about 27%. Critics slammed him for firing the city’s first black police chief shortly after taking office, for his handling of blighted neighborhoods and for a recent police-involved killing of an unarmed black man. Last week, his campaign faced fresh scrutiny for using a stock photograph of a black woman and her child on a campaign website, instead of images of people Buttigieg had met, and for listing among South Carolina Democrats who had endorsed the Douglass Plan a handful of people who said they had not given their permission to use their names publicly.\n",

      "Kamala Harris criminal justice plan calls for government loans to marijuana growers\n",
      "Tucked away inside 2020 Democrat Kamala Harris' criminal justice plan is a proposal to give government subsidies to \"socially and economically disadvantaged individuals\" who wish to start their own marijuana business.          The California senator's proposal, released Monday, describes how reforming the nation's marijuana laws can help end \"mass incarceration,\" and racial disparities in the criminal justice system. One way to deal with that, Harris proposes, is to give federal dollars to states and localities so they can give loans for qualifying Americans interested in hopping onto the country's partially-legalized agricultural sector.          \"[Provide] states and localities with funds to make loans to assist small businesses in the marijuana industry that are owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,\" Harris' plan reads.          The funds used for these new grants would come from a \"sales tax on marijuana and marijuana products.\"          During her presidential run, Harris has come under scrutiny for her marijuana prosecution record as California's attorney general. During her six years in office, at least 1,974 individuals were jailed for marijuana-related crimes. During the second Democratic debate, in July, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said she was \"deeply concerned\" by Harris' role in that marijuana crackdown.          The plan comes as states are increasingly voting to legalize marijuana, including California. The drug remains strictly prohibited by federal law.          The Obama administration's Justice Department largely took a hands-off approach to marijuana law enforcement. The Trump administration has cracked down to a degree, but states still largely have discretion to cultivate marijuana industries locally as they see fit.          Harris calls for the total legalization of marijuana in her criminal justice plan, as well as funding \"for programs that minimize marijuana licensing and employment for the individuals most adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.\"          Individuals previously arrested for drug-related offenses would also qualify for grants that would help with \"job training, re-entry services, [and] legal aid,\" the plan states.          \"So it is past time to end the failed war on drugs, and it begins with legalizing marijuana. Marijuana arrests account for over 50% of all drug arrests. Of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010, 88% were for simple marijuana possession,\" Harris' plan reads. \"Worse, despite roughly equal usage rates, Black people are about four times more likely than White people to be arrested for marijuana\n",

      "Kamala Harris Wouldn’t Apologize For Cynical Attack On Biden During Debate, Might Not Be ‘Lock’ For VP\n",
      "During the first round of Democratic primary debates in June 2019, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) attacked now-presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden over his opposition to federally mandated busing in the 1970s. Soon after the attack rocketed Harris to the national spotlight, she admitted she did not support such a policy. Her refusal to apologize for the fraudulent attack on Biden may cost her a chance to be his vice-presidential candidate. Biden has repeatedly said he would select a woman of color as his vice-presidential candidate, leading many to believe Harris would be a prime choice, despite her history of arresting African-Americans for low-level drug offenses in California. A new report from Politico, however, suggests Harris isn’t a “lock” for the VP nod. Not due to her history as California’s Attorney General that is now anathema to the Democratic Party, but because she didn’t apologize for what she did to Biden during that first debate. Former Sen. Chris Dodd is part of Biden’s vice presidential search committee and asked Harris about her attack on Biden during the debate. “She laughed and said, ‘that’s politics.’ She had no remorse,” Dodd told a Biden supporter and donor, who shared this exchange with Politico. “Dodd felt it was a gimmick, that it was cheap.”          That donor told Politico that Dodd was so concerned with Harris that he “helped elevate California Rep. Karen Bass during the vetting process, urging Biden to pick her because ‘she’s a loyal No. 2. And that’s what Biden really wants,’” the outlet reported. And people in three other competing camps privately said that while their candidates have a shot for VP, Harris is more likely to get the nod. Yet with Biden set to make his decision as soon as the beginning of August, there are still hang-ups over Harris — largely over the matter of trust. Former high-ranking Democratic Party officials and elected officials have expressed concerns about her to the vetting committee in recent weeks, according to four sources who’ve spoken to the Biden vetting team. Biden’s team apparently thinks Harris “is the closest Biden has to a ‘do no harm’ option,” Politico reported. Harris, however, imprisoned thousands of African Americans in California for low-level drug offenses and truancy, which contributed to over-policing. The Democratic Party is now allowing many high-profile members to openly call for abolishing police departments, with some liberal cities actually voting for such a measure. As The medianame previously reported, after Harris attacked Biden for his decades-old support for federally mandated busing, she changed her position, telling a crowd that she thinks “of busing as being in the toolbox of what is available and what can be used for the goal of desegregating America’s schools,” and not that it should be mandated. “I believe that any tool that is in the toolbox should be considered by a school district,” she said further, bringing her more in line with Biden’s old position. The medianame is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.\n",

      "Kamala Harris stands far left of true American principles\n",
      "Sen. Kamala Harris favors higher taxes on businesses, higher taxes on higher-income earners and social justice — that last, a catchall phrase that gives her carte blanche to press progressive policy into every hot button issue of the day, from the environment to coronavirus stimulus disbursements to housing to education. She’s a far leftist, all right. But she comes at a time in history when words like “socialism” and “collectivism” don’t carry the same negative connotations they once did, and economic descriptors like “capitalism” and “free market” are sold as code for unfair, unjust, racist even. That makes her dangerous. So do her many flip-flops of recent months. At first a Bernie Sanders-like believer in “Medicare for All,” Harris, from the presidential campaign trail, later watered and pressed a more hybrid version that didn’t completely kill the private insurance market. At first a critic of legalized marijuana, Harris, in a 2018 tweet, announced support for Sen. Cory Booker’s Marijuana Justice Act “making marijuana legal at the federal level.”          At first a willing partner with federal immigration and drug enforcement officials, Harris, in 2018, compared ICE to the Ku Klux Klan. At first a staunch supporter of the women — the many women — who accused Joe Biden of sexual harassment, saying at a campaign event in 2019 that she “believe[d] them” and “respect[ed] them being about to tell their story and having the courage to do it,” Harris, now, is a staunch supporter of Joe Biden. It’s #MeToo, with a twist. Would the real Kamala Harris please stand up? Harris, like many politicians — from both parties, too — is undoubtedly opportunistic and ambitious. But it’s her combined unprincipled far leftist views that set her apart from the average political bear. If Biden is the candidate who can’t put together a coherent sentence, Harris is the pit bull prosecutor who will stop at nothing to take advantage of his weakness to steamroll her progressive-to-the-point-of-socialist policies into the White House. She’s a social justice warrior who’s just been handed, via the VP ticket, one of the largest, most influential platforms America has to offer. “Let’s speak the truth,” she told Cosmopolitan in June. “People are protesting because Black people have been treated as less than human in America. Because our country has never fully addressed the system racism that has plagued our country since its earliest days.”          “Student loan relief for Pell Grant recipients is just one component of our plan to reduce the opportunity gap for Black entrepreneurs,” she wrote on Twitter in July, 2019. It’s a world view that promotes victimhood, not personal accountability. And frankly, that’s not American. Social justice, racial justice, criminal justice reform — these are action calls that have been commonly used by leftists to further the designs of Big Government while circumventing the limits of the Constitution. Think about it. If the case can be made that the primary reason Blacks, say, end up in jail is because of unfair policing rather than personal choice, well then, the whole criminal justice system becomes cause for suspicion. It becomes incumbent on government to make it fair. So, too, with housing, with education, with access to clean air and clear water, with job opportunities, with health care — if these are all seen as matters that are unequally doled and distributed to some, at the expense and unfair labors of others, then once again, it’s Big Government to the rescue. It’s Big Government who must step in and serve as the social justice reformer. Her flip-flops are problematic. It’s her political focus on pretend and fabricated disparities that makes her a real threat to America, though. America’s founding and governing documents aren’t inherently racist, inherently unjust; rather, they open up opportunities for all to shine, based on individual drive, motivation, persistence and determination. But Harris doesn’t represent the Constitution, the concept of limited government or the idea of individual over collective rights. And she’ll use her soft and squishy social justice phraseology to fundamentally change the shape of America so that citizens’ rights mean only what the government decides, allows and bestows.

      "Kamala Harris Names Her Four All-Time Favorite Politicians. One Is a Beloved Republican.\n",
      "Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) revealed the list of her four favorite politicians of all time on Friday while appearing on Will Ferrell’s “Ron Burgundy Podcast.”          The Democratic presidential candidate was quick to name her top three favorites, which consisted of former Rep. Shirley Chisholm (D-NY), who was the first black woman elected to Congress; former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy; and Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president.          “You know, one of the people I think is really great, who is still living but who has done really great work on an issue like climate change, for example, is Jerry Brown,” Harris said, seemingly placing the former California Governor as her number four pick.          “I mean, I didn’t agree with everything he did, but I do appreciate that he always, as a leader, had a vision of the future and tried to connect where we’re going to end up with where we are now,” she continued. “And thinking about solutions and ways to mitigate harm in the future.”          Harris acknowledged that as she often looks to these individuals for inspiration when she feels exhausted or overwhelmed by politics, especially while she has been campaigning for the Democratic nomination for the presidency.          “Someone I’ve been thinking a lot about, because I am running for president, is Shirley Chisholm,” Harris said. “I love the fact that she would just own that microphone and speak truth. And unburdened by what others might think of as the appropriateness of her being present and speaking as forcefully and as strongly as she did.”          Chisholm became the first black major-party candidate to run for president after she formally launched her campaign in 1972. Her campaign slogan at the time was “Unbought and unbossed,” which has been influential to the California senator.          “I take great inspiration from that [slogan] because she understood that she was a voice of truth and a voice that must be heard,” Harris said. “She just went to that microphone and took hold of it and didn’t ask permission.”          Harris has often expressed her admiration for the former New York congresswoman, especially during Black History Month and Women’s History Month.          “Shirley Chisholm created a path for me and so many others,” she tweeted in Feb. 2018. “She is one of the reasons I am serving the people of California in the U.S. Senate today.”          Days later, Harris penned an op-ed in Essence magazine where she called for more black women to follow in Chisholm’s footsteps and run for elected positions across the country, as well as urging for Congress to pass legislation that would place a statue of Chisholm inside the nation’s Capitol Building.          “Fifty years from now, I hope that statue stands among the other American icons we honor in the Capitol. I hope Black women crowd into the Senators-only elevator, giving every American equal voice and equal representation,” Harris wrote. “And I hope that all our nation’s leaders demonstrate the guts, grit, and grace that Shirley Chisholm taught us.”\n",

      "Good Riddance to Kamala Harris\n",
      "Per Edward-Isaac Dovere, Kamala Harris is no longer running for president. This is excellent, welcome news — the cause for celebration. Good riddance! May Harris’s failed attempt to find higher office destroy her career and sully her reputation for all time.          I’m told that I’m not supposed to feel like this — or, at least, that if I do feel like this, I’m not supposed to say so in public. People worked on that campaign, you see. People tried really hard. But that, I’m afraid, is a load of old nonsense. Harris was running for the presidency, which is another way of saying that she was running to acquire power. I did not want her to have that power. It is true that some people tried their best to help her gain that power. They’re probably upset today. But they’ll get over it. She’s not that special.          On the contrary: She’s a would-be tyrant whose primary contribution to American life thus far has been to fight “tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony and the suppression of crucial information by prosecutors”; who has openly promised to act without Congress; and who showed us exactly who she is during the Kavanaugh hearings, at which she implied that she knew something terrible about the nominee for the sole purpose of sharing the insinuation on her Twitter feed. Harris is a woman who, if successful (“successful”), would have overseen the mass confiscation of millions of firearms, the seizing of patents, the federalization of abortion law, and, depending on the polling, the elimination of (her word) the private health insurance plans of 180 million people.          Everything that is wrong with American politics is summed up in Kamala Harris. She’s a weather vane. She’s dishonest. She’s a coward. She’s condescending. And she’s a phony. She’s the answer to no useful or virtuous question. Nothing good has come from her election. She has nothing of value to offer America. Goodbye. Bad luck. That’s all, folks.\n",

      "Twenty Years After Busing Ended, School Segregation Is Back\n",
      "Busing, the transporting of public school children to end racial segregation, was thrust back into national conversations when Senator Kamala Harris criticized Vice President Joe Biden, over his record on it at the first Democratic presidential debate.          But while her words sparked a renewed conversation about the subject, busing itself has been dead for 20 years this month. Busing is a complex issue. I know this from both my personal and professional experience. I also know that the re-segregation of public schools means separate but unequal opportunities for African-American children.          Like Kamala Harris, I was bused. Like Harris, I went to law school. In 1999, as a young civil rights attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, my caseload included the landmark busing case Swann v Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education in North Carolina, in which white parents challenged busing and won.          When Brown v. Topeka Board of Education, in 1954, uprooted the racial segregation begun under Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896, the battle over segregation did not end. First, the Supreme Court ruled segregated public schools were unconstitutional. Then, in 1955, the Court decided the lesser-known Brown II case, requiring public schools to desegregate “with all deliberate speed.” They didn’t.          Instead, white parents left for the suburbs, created Christian schools, formed White Citizens’ Councils and filed lawsuits. Virginia even closed its public schools to avoid desegregation. In 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of busing as a way to end racial segregation because African-American children were still attending segregated schools. White children had been riding school buses for decades, but the idea of using the same mechanism to desegregate public schools triggered violent protests.          My hometown of Kansas City, Mo., fought desegregation, though not as viciously as Boston, where adults attacked buses carrying African-American children desegregating white schools. Still, I awoke before sunrise and rode school busses crisscrossing Kansas City. Strangers appeared in my high school classrooms with clipboards, asking questions. After they left, African-American students were moved next to white students. I was asked to run for class office and an African-American teacher was promoted to vice-principal. The strangers had been civil rights attorneys trying to erase vestiges of segregation.          Decades later, as a civil rights attorney myself, I watched the busses crisscross Charlotte-Mecklenburg’s 546 square miles. I checked for signs of racial inequality in classrooms, libraries, teacher salaries and extracurricular activities. The diverse student population inside Charlotte-Mecklenburg buildings belied its racially segregated classrooms. Instead of skin color, test scores and vocational tracking became a way to keep the color line. African-American children were disproportionally expelled. There remained work to do.          When white parents in North Carolina sued to end busing, Judge Robert Potter, who had actively worked against busing before ascending to the bench, presided over the case. He ruled that Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools were no longer segregated. It was Sept. 11, 1999. An appeal failed. Court-ordered busing was over.          Not all whites viewed busing as a loss of race-based power. But even those few school districts trying to voluntarily desegregate through busing were stopped, in 2007, by Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote, “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” He ruled, in effect, that not allowing a minority of white parents their school of choice was discrimination.          African-American communities bore the brunt of both segregation and busing. Separate was never equal. Instead of repairing or building schools, ours were torn down. Lost were locations of cultural pride, meeting places for dances where teenage awkwardness was not exacerbated by race. Busing meant African-American children, like me, withstood prejudice and loneliness.          Twenty years later, Charlotte-Mecklenburg and Kansas City schools are re-segregating. In fact, a report from UCLA’s Civil Rights Project and the Center for Education and Civil Rights, found that, in 2016, 40% of African-American students nationwide were in schools with 90% or more students of color. In New York City, where I live, controversy around segregated public schools is tragically similar to my early years. The benefit of desegregation, then and now, is the breakdown of racial stereotypes. This diverse nation cannot afford to live in silos of distrust and ignorance of one another.          Busing was essential to breaking segregation’s stranglehold. It was also a polarizing symbol, weighed down by racist fears and unrealistic expectations. But for African-American parents, like mine, busing was a chance worth taking. For me, and perhaps Kamala Harris, the scars and benefits of busing are a daily reminder of this nation’s short-lived attempt at addressing its past.          Educational equality is a form of reparations and an investment in America’s future. America created apartheid with Plessy v. Ferguson. Any desegregation plans must be a shared burden. But are we willing to take it on?\n",

      "Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is, it is now obvious, a rising star in the Democratic Party. Supporters compare her to a neo-Obama — and to Game of Thrones heroine and queen of dragons Daenerys Targaryen. There’s an unofficial Harris 2020 presidential campaign Facebook page with 1,137 followers. Just days after the 2016 presidential election, the New Yorker listed Harris among “Thirteen Women Who Should Think About Running for President in 2020.”          With a background as San Francisco district attorney from 2004 to 2011 and California attorney general from 2011 to 2016, Harris has been recognized as a bold but meticulous legislator for the DC Circuit.          And while she has said publicly that she doesn’t intend to run for president in 2020, her high-profile (and often interrupted) performance at recent Senate Intelligence Committee hearings has left several news outlets speculating that she is positioning herself to at least consider campaigning.          Let’s narrow in on some of her biggest achievements — and what they tell us about her legislative priorities.          1) During the housing crisis, she won a historic mortgage settlement case that helped more than 84,000 California families          Harris’s landmark accomplishment as California AG came on the heels of the financial crisis. In 2012, during her first year in the position, she brokered a $25 billion settlement deal with the nation’s five largest mortgage companies (Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, CitiFinancial, GMAC/Ally Financial, and Wells Fargo) citing improper foreclosure practices. California homeowners received $18.4 billion in mortgage relief, according to a 2013 report by the AG’s California Monitor Program.          To make this happen, Harris took a major risk. She pulled out of an earlier settlement deal in an effort to hold out for more money for the affected homeowners — a decision that was widely criticized at first. But in the end, her gamble paid off. The New York Times described it at the time:          2) She’s come out against for-profit colleges          Her next big victory as AG came in 2016 when she won a $1.1 billion settlement against the for-profit (now defunct) Corinthian Colleges for predatory and unlawful practices.          But her track record on predatory higher education schemes is far from perfect. The issue came up during her Senate race in 2016 when her opponent Loretta Sanchez criticized her for failing to investigate complaints against Trump University after it was revealed that her AG office received contributions from Donald Trump in 2003 and 2011.          The New York Times broke the story that Trump has made tens of thousands of dollars in contributions to at least four state attorneys general who were investigating Trump University, including Harris. The Harris campaign told the Times that she donated the money from Trump to charities after the then-presidential candidate made derogatory statements about Mexicans.          Since her election to the Senate, Harris has demonstrated strong support for affordable opportunities in higher ed. She co-sponsored a bill in May of this year with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). If it passes, it would allow students with outstanding loan debt to refinance at the (often lower) interest rates offered to new borrowers.          3) Her work with the LGBTQ community led to the SCOTUS decision in favor of marriage equality          During her time as DA from 2004 to 2011, Harris opposed both Proposition 22 and Proposition 8, which limited marriage to one man and one woman. Though they passed in 2000 and 2008, respectively, both were struck down while she was in office. As San Francisco DA, Harris also created a Hate Crimes Unit aimed at prosecuting hate crimes committed against LGBTQ teens in school.          Harris’s early support of marriage equality in California directly laid the legal groundwork for the US Supreme Court’s decision in 2012 that same-sex couples have the right to marry. The Court cited California’s success in striking down Prop 8 in its opinion. Within hours of the decision, plaintiffs to the Supreme Court case Kris Perry and Sandy Stier became the first gay couple to wed in San Francisco, and Harris officiated their wedding.          4) She has experience prosecuting human trafficking — and is sharply critical of the war on drugs          A major priority for Harris during her tenure as AG was prosecuting transnational gangs known for trafficking drugs, firearms, and humans. Her office also led a groundbreaking study on the impacts of transnational criminal organizations and human trafficking in California.          She’s channeled that experience in her criticisms of the Trump administration recently. At the 2017 Ideas Conference in May, hosted by the liberal think tank Center for American Progress — an event widely seen as a proving ground for potential Democratic presidential candidates — Harris gave a speech where she called out the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on their trafficking and drug policies.          “Let me tell you what California needs, Jeff Sessions,” she said, eliciting applause from the crowd. “We need support in dealing with transnational criminal organizations and dealing with human trafficking — not in going after grandma’s medicinal marijuana.”          5) She calls herself “smart on crime,” but some allege she’s really “tough on crime”          When she was first elected AG in 2010, Harris commanded a staff of nearly 5,000 people in the state with the country’s second-largest nonfederal prison system. At that time it had 135,000 inmates and 750 individuals on death row, per a New York Times report.          In 2014, BuzzFeed reported that the attorney general’s office lawyer had unsuccessfully argued against the release of eligible nonviolent prisoners from California's overcrowded prisons because the state wanted to keep them as a source of state labor. The federal judges disagreed with this argument and ruled against Harris’s lawyers.          Harris came under fire again in 2016 for signing off on California Gov. Jerry Brown’s sweeping prison reform ballot initiative that would repeal determinate sentencing laws and offer parole programs to inmates in state-run prisons. The state District Attorneys Association alleged that it was forced through without enough time for public comment. That year, Harris’s AG office was also the subject of a 2016 investigation by the Intercept into prosecutorial misconduct and informant misuse.          Meanwhile, Harris’s stance on the constitutionality of the death penalty is a bit of a mystery. During her time as San Francisco district attorney, in a highly publicized and widely criticized decision, she did not pursue capital punishment for then-22-year-old David Hill, an alleged gang member who shot and killed city police officer Isaac Espinoza.          But later in 2014, as attorney general, Harris went to the Ninth Circuit Court to appeal US District Judge Cormac J. Carney’s decision declaring the death penalty unconstitutional. According to reporting at the time by the LA Times, Harris offered a window into how she understands her responsibility to constituents, even those she disagrees with: She reportedly said that though she personally opposes the death penalty, she was elected by voters who supported it, and she pledged to enforce the law.\n",

      "Trump Promises to ‘Take a Look’ at Bogus Kamala Harris Birther Claim\n",
      "In a move that reeked of the birtherism, racism, and xenophobia that helped elevate him to office, President Donald Trump on Thursday said he’s “heard” that Sen. Kamala Harris may not “meet the requirements” to appear on the Democratic presidential ticket and vowed to “take a look” at the claim when someone asked the president if Harris is somehow not a natural born citizen.          Rather than immediately shutting down the birther conspiracy theory that erupted in the wake of Joe Biden’s pick of Harris as his VP, Trump appeared to lean into the baseless rumor when asked about it by a reporter at Thursday’s press briefing.          “I have no idea if that's right, I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for vice president,\" Trump said “But that's a very serious... you're saying that they're saying that she doesn't qualify because she wasn't born in this country?”          Trump admitted he had no idea if the claim he was being asked about over the senator’s background was accurate before rambling on to say, “I just heard about it, I'll take a look.\" He went on to praise the lawyer who first put forward the birther claims about Harris as “highly qualified” and “very talented.”          The questions about Harris are without merit. But the California Democrat, who had one parent come to the United States from India and the other from Jamaica, is already facing the same kind of racism that Trump elevated about former President Barack Obama during the Democrat’s time in office.          In a fact check earlier this week, The Associated Press thoroughly debunked the conspiracy charge being leveled at Harris, citing her being born in Oakland, California.          After Trump’s comments, communications officials with Biden’s campaign pointed to a statement they had made earlier in the day as the same line gained oxygen on the right.          “Donald Trump was the national leader of the grotesque, racist birther movement with respect to President Obama and has sought to fuel racism and tear our nation apart on every single day of his presidency,” Biden campaign rapid response director Andrew Bates said. “So it's unsurprising, but no less abhorrent, that as Trump makes a fool of himself straining to distract the American people from the horrific toll of his failed coronavirus response that his campaign and their allies would resort to wretched, demonstrably false lies in their pathetic desperation.”          Around a minute into the briefing Thursday, Trump used the opportunity to level a series of attacks on Joe Biden as his own administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic faces withering attacks from the newly announced Democratic presidential ticket.          And in the process, he mangled his own messaging on masks, the crucial public health measure he took months to practice himself despite his own administration encouraging the public to don masks in public since early April.          Earlier Thursday, the day after Biden appeared with Harris for the first time as a pair, both Democrats pushed for what would amount to a mask mandate across the country for three months. Biden urged governors to do the same thing. Harris used her introduction as the presumptive Democratic vice presidential nominee Wednesday to eviscerate the president’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.          At a time where one could hope the president would be using his platform to educate the American public about the pandemic that has killed more than 166,000 in the country, and on the same day the U.S. reported the most COVID-related fatalities since May, the first part of the briefing was filled with jabs and attacks at his political rival.          “He does not identify what authority the president has to issue such a mandate or how federal law enforcement could possibly enforce it or why we would be stepping on governors throughout our country, many of whom have done a very good job and they know what is needed,” Trump said.          Even some Republican governors in the United States have issued statewide mask orders because of the deadly nature of the virus, but others have shunned the move despite the clear public health benefit as the nation’s death toll continues to climb.          While Trump scoffed at Biden’s call for a mask mandate —dismissing the idea of a president having the “unilateral power” to order citizens to wear masks —the president himself has at least on one occasion claimed to have absolute authority in terms of other government bodies during the pandemic.          That pivotal moment came in April when he declared “when somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total and that is the way it’s gonna be. It’s total. It’s total. And the governors know that,” over states reopening decisions, though he later backed off from that aggressive rhetorical approach.          And by the end of May, Trump demanded places of worship be opened, championing that he would override governors if they didn’t follow along.          And on Thursday, citing the importance of Americans having “freedom” as a reason not to impose a nationwide mask order, Trump touted that his own administration is urging people to wear masks as “a patriotic thing to do.”          \"Maybe they're great and maybe they're just good, maybe they're not so good, but frankly what do you have to lose? You have nothing to lose,\" Trump said.\n",

      "Analysis | Who are the women probably on Joe Biden’s shortlist for vice president?\n",
      "Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.): Yes, the former presidential candidate memorably landed a punch on Biden in one of the first Democratic presidential debates, about busing during school desegregation. But Harris is also a well-known senator and before that was attorney general of her state, and she has endorsed Biden. “She’s qualified to be president; I’d consider her for anything she’d be interested in,” Biden said in January. The potential downside to picking Harris: California isn’t really a state Biden needs to campaign much in to win a general election against President Trump.          Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.): She’s another former 2020 candidate, who, unlike Harris, stayed in the race long enough to get votes. She came in third in the New Hampshire primaries in February. And she comes from a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 by only a point and a half. Also, Klobuchar dropped out of the race earlier this month and immediately endorsed Biden, contributing to the momentum that propelled him into the lead over Sanders.          Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer: She’s probably the least-known name on this shortlist, but Whitmer is beloved by national Democrats. She won the governor’s seat in Michigan in 2018, taking it back for Democrats for the first time in nearly a decade. She delivered the 2020 Democratic address to Trump’s State of the Union. She frames herself as a moderate. And — perhaps most importantly — she is from a state that Trump narrowly won in 2016 and that will be crucial to deciding who wins in 2020.          Update: On Monday, Whitmer said on MSNBC: “It’s not going to be me.\" She didn’t elaborate other than to say “But I am going to have a hand in helping make sure that he has the rounded-out ticket that can win.”          Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.): She and Biden don’t agree ideologically on issues such as health care, but the left took Warren’s presidential loss hard, and she could be a unifying pick for the party.          Stacey Abrams: The Georgia Democrat was one of the party’s stars during the 2018 midterm election, coming close to winning Georgia’s governor mansion. She has since dedicated herself to voting rights causes and delivered one of the Democrats’ responses to Trump’s State of the Union address. She is also from a state that Democrats would like to make competitive regularly, including a Senate race in November that could be key to which party holds the majority. The potential downside: Her highest office so far has been as a state lawmaker.          Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.): She is not a household name, but Cortez Masto has similar qualifications to Harris. She was Nevada’s attorney general before becoming its senator in a competitive election in 2016. She was the first Latina elected to the Senate, ever, and she is the first woman from Nevada to be a U.S. senator. Nevada is a state Democrats need to win for the White House, but it’s not as competitive as some of the other states on this list, like Michigan or Minnesota. She’s currently leading Democrats’ efforts to take back the Senate in November.          Other Democratic elected officials to watch: Govs. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island (she is in her second term there and has held national positions for Democratic governors) and Michelle Lujan Grisham in New Mexico, who as the former chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus could help activate Democratic Latino voters; Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) a war veteran with an impressive personal story, Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) a skillful campaigner who comes from a must-win presidential state, and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), another 2020 presidential contender who has championed women’s rights; and Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), who was a House impeachment manager during the trial to remove the president.\n",

      "Why is Kamala Harris gone while Pete Buttigieg is still here?\n",
      "Rafia Zakaria is the author of \" The Upstairs Wife: An Intimate History of Pakistan \" (Beacon 2015) and \" Veil \" (Bloomsbury 2017). She is a columnist for Dawn newspaper in Pakistan and The Baffler. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on medianame.          (medianame) On Tuesday, Sen. Kamala Harris ended her campaign for president. With her decision, a dream -- mine and so many others' -- of seeing a brown woman become president of the United States faded. Harris' historic run, the first by an Indian/Jamaican-American woman, undoubtedly inspired many American women, particularly those who do not see their own ethnic or racial background reflected in the largely white American political sphere.          Harris' attempt to win the nomination for president may be over, but her candidacy reveals truths about the American political landscape that Americans in general and the Democratic Party in particular need to take seriously.          There are many reasons that Kamala Harris could not sustain her presidential run but one central obstacle is that she made her presidential bid in a country that is unused to seeing women who look like her in power -- let alone in the highest political office. Ninety percent of elected offices in America are held by whites with 65% held by white men, according to the Reflective Democracy Campaign . Harris, who had occupied the top law enforcement positions in San Francisco and then all of California, won statewide office as a moderate in a majority minority state (where notably political offices are still held mostly by whites).          With that resume, Harris then tried to contend for America's political center as a candidate. On healthcare, she took the centrist position of supporting a version of Medicare For All while stopping short of a Bernie Sanders-esque complete overhaul of the healthcare system. She argued that her record as a prosecutor who pursued pragmatic rather than ideological solutions to thorny problems ( such as the death penalty) uniquely qualified her to do the same if she won the presidency. That argument largely fell on deaf ears.          What Harris saw as political dexterity, essential to bringing people together, others saw in this moment of ideological tribalism as a damning failure to pick a side. Meanwhile, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, white and male and espousing many of the same positions as Harris (but with far less time holding political office under his belt) has fared a lot better , even leading the polls in Iowa. Like Harris, Buttigieg supports a version of Medicare For All but without a total overhaul of the healthcare system. Both come from middle-class academic families who have supported their political ambitions.          There is one crucial difference. Buttigieg is a white man who like the other 90% of whites who hold political office in America, appears to many to be more electable than a strong brown woman. Some of this can be seen in how Buttigieg's cool-headed pragmatic rationality becomes in Harris case an unwelcome tendency to be bent by political circumstance. So unquestioned is this discrepancy that one commentator recently wrote that it was Mayor Pete , a white man, (and not Harris, with her status as a fellow centrist and former Obama ally) who most reminded him of President Obama. Of course, while there is no direct evidence (there never is) that a combination of race and gender hastened the end of the Harris candidacy, it is true that all the front-runners left in the democratic field are white.          In the post-2018 Democratic Party landscape, brown and immigrant women like Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York are welcome -- but only if they keep to the far left edges of the party. Harris' effort to occupy the center indicated a refusal to adhere to the implicit stay-in-your far-left lane message being doled out. Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez may have won in their minority dominated districts and been celebrated by the Democratic Party as emerging leaders, but when it came to Harris' bid to represent all Americans, the support was far less ebullient.          This is not to say that race alone sank the Harris candidacy. She was slow to outline her position on Medicare For All. When she scored a debate win against former Vice President Joe Biden in the first contest, pointing out how his position against federally mandated busing to desegregate school districts (she was one of the minority students who benefited from it) she wasted a poignant moment that could have established her as belonging to a new generation of politicians. But her campaign had no discernible plan to capitalize on the defining moment and its impact, or to effectively position Harris as a heroic woman of color who had been front and center in the country's efforts toward racial equality. She was soon lost again in the scrum of candidates.          Unsurprisingly that misstep may have contributed to her ability to define herself as a black/brown candidate. Like Obama was during his candidacy and administration, her blackness was questioned . Critics pointed to the fact that she is the child of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father and that she is married to a white man to question whether she really qualified as black. Harris admitted that the questions were hurtful but did not substantively engage them. Nor did she take up in a deep way the fact that her history as a prosecutor, inevitably putting away black men, left her open to being labeled a traitor.          Her silence has cost her. In the weeks before her withdrawal from the race, it was Biden who was leading among black voters , followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Older and moderate black voters themselves preferred Biden and younger black voters, particularly women, were attracted to the promises of Medicare For All and an end to student debt . It is also possible that while a black man for president was a dream come true, a Jamaican/Indian woman taking the same shot appeared overconfident. Misogyny after all is not simply a problem that afflicts the white majority.          When the presidential race began, the diversity of the candidates vying for the Democratic Party's nomination seemed to make a welcome and hopeful statement. However, as the race has progressed, the white candidates have been the ones to dominate the field. This is so even when there is (as is the case with Harris and Buttigieg) little difference in policy positions between white and non-white candidates. With Harris gone and the candidacies of Sen. Cory Booker and Julian Castro flailing , it seems that the Democratic Party's salute to diversity was only skin deep -- and the real contenders left standing at the end will all be white.\n",
