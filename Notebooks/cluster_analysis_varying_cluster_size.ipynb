      "Oklahoma couple accused of murdering teen as ‘payback’ for STD\n",
      "A twisted couple in Oklahoma has been charged with murdering a 17-year-old girl as “payback” over a sexually transmitted disease, court documents show.          Andrew Hall, 30, and Cheyenne Blalock, 17, were charged Friday with first-degree murder in the death of Kirstan Patterson, who was found shot in the head Wednesday just hours after she was reported missing, KOTV reported.          “Be very careful who you hang out with and who you run around [with], because it can make a difference,” Mayes County Sheriff Mike Reed told the station. “I promise you your parents would rather get up at 1 in the morning and come and give you a ride home than something detrimental happen to you.”          Blalock told investigators that Hall had discussed killing Patterson as “payback” for a sexually transmitted disease and told her to text the teen to meet up with them on New Year’s Day, court documents show.          Hall made Blalock ride in the back of his car beneath a blanket as they picked up Patterson, she told deputies.          But Hall told investigators he thought Blalock — who was armed with knives — was “only going to physically assault” Patterson and was afraid she would turn violent if he didn’t comply with her demands, court records show.          Deputies allege that either Hall or Blalock then shot Patterson with a rifle they grabbed from Hall’s trunk. Investigators from the Mayes County Sheriff’s Office said Blalock and Hall have implicated each other in the slaying, the Tulsa World reported.          Blalock, meanwhile, has denied witnessing the fatal shooting, but said she heard two gunshots while at the Spring Creek Recreation Area. She admitted touching Patterson’s body to confirm that she was dead and claimed Hall tried to clean up the scene, according to an affidavit.          “Blalock said Hall poured bleach on the body in some effort to destroy evidence, and then Hall moved the body into the water,” the affidavit says.          Hall and Blalock had allegedly discussed several ways of killing Patterson. The teen, who attended Chouteau-Mazie Public Schools, played volleyball for her high school, KTUL reported.          “Our heart goes out to the family,” Mayes County Sheriff’s Office Maj. Rod Howell told Tulsa World. “I’ve got kids, and I just couldn’t fathom.”          Hall and Blalock, who are set to return to court Thursday, remain jailed on $1 million bond, the newspaper reported.\n",

      "Autistic boy, 6, and his sister, 5, are found after they went missing\n",
      "Two young siblings who disappeared from their front yard have been found in a wooded area less than a mile away from their Florida home on Tuesday.          Braxton Williams, 6, and his sister Bri'ya Williams, 5, first went missing on Sunday morning outside their home at the Paradise Valley mobile park in Jacksonville.          The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office announced the children had been found safe and alive in a dilapidated pumphouse near their home, News4Jax reports.          'We are happy to announce that Braxton and Bri’ya Williams have been located. Thank you to the community for your support and to our partner agencies for assisting in this search,' the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office wrote on Twitter.          Nineteen Jacksonville Sheriff's Office deputies and other authorities were doing a line search in a wooded area on day three of the probe into their disappearance.          Sheriff Mike Williams said that one of the rescue team members heard a child's voice, prompting authorities to fan out and search other parts of the area.          They eventually discovered Braxton and Bri'ya in the pumphouse around a quarter mile into the wooded area from their home off West Beaver Street.          The children were brought out of the woods of around 3.30pm and were met by a cousin who ran over after noticing the commotion.          She said: 'I didn’t know what to expect. I didn’t know if it was good, bad or whatever, but they reassured me that everything was perfectly fine. We just thank God, because the only thing we wanted was the kids home and safe with their parents, so it has been a glorious day.'          Williams said the children were slightly dehydrated and had a few bumps, but appeared in good health and were very talkative.          They reportedly clung to first responders as they were transported to a waiting Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department ambulance.          'They asked for a cheese pizza, that we quickly delivered to them,' Williams told NBC News.          Afterwards, first responders could be seen kneeling in prayer as the ambulance took the siblings to the UF Health medical center for observation.          'It’s a blessing. A lot of hard work been done and that’s all I want to say. Thank God for it,' she said.          JFRD Chief Keith Powers said: 'A lot of times we don’t have great outcomes. I think this is a glorious day for the city that we were able to do this.'          'But it all goes to show you what the partnership that works and how we can make a difference in people’s lives. The good thing is, is that family is fixing to have a wonderful Christmas,' he continued.          As of Tuesday, investigators searched more than 430 homes, 20 bodies of water and a 130 acres of land, using additional air units and K-9s.          Braxton and Bri'ya initially went missing around 11.30am on December 15 while playing outside their home.          Bryan Williams, the children's father, was setting up a barbecue in the family's yard and briefly went inside.          When he came out, the siblings were gone and he later called local authorities when he couldn't find them.          'I've been doing this for the last three years,' he told NBC News,' and called it a 'normal' day.          Authorities said Braxton 'on the Autism Spectrum but will communicate with others,' after they released an Amber Alert.          Williams urged neighbors and Jacksonville residents to 'remain vigilant' and help search for the children.          'If you live in the area, please search your property including under mobile homes, in sheds, in and around abandoned cars,' he said in a previous press release.\n",

      "Former High Sheriff of Derbyshire named as victim who died in floods\n",
      "A woman who died after being swept up by floodwater and found two miles away has been named as former High Sheriff of Derbyshire, Annie Hall.          Police said Mrs Hall's body was found in the early hours of Friday after she was swept away by water in Darley Dale, near Matlock.          Mrs Hall served as the county's High Sheriff in 2017 and has been described as a 'great leader'.          Sheffield in South Yorkshire received 84mm of rain over 36 hours, which is almost the average monthly rainfall for Yorkshire, Met Office weather forecaster Marco Petanga said. Gringley on the Hill in Nottinghamshire had 65mm of rain in that time.          The Environment Agency issued seven severe flood warnings on Saturday morning suggesting there is a 'danger to life'.          The warnings were in place for the River Don at Barnby Dun, Bently, Fishlake, Kirk Bramwith, Kirk Sandall, South Bramwith and Willow Bridge caravan site.          There were also 55 warnings telling people to take immediate action in light of expected flooding, along with 88 alerts urging residents to be prepared.          Tributes to Mrs Hall came as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for better flood management ahead of a visit to deluged communities today.          During a visit to Leeds on Saturday, Mr Corbyn said better upstream river management and flood defences in towns were needed and called for more funding for emergency services.          'Obviously we need much better flood management and prevention schemes,' he said.          'It also means properly funding our fire and rescue services and properly funding our Environment Agency to deal with this.          'The Environment Agency has lost a fifth of its staff, the fire services have lost more than a fifth of their staff. They're struggling to cope with this.'          The Labour leader said the UK could expect more extreme weather due to climate change.          As Mrs Hall was identified earlier today, Derbyshire Police's Chief Constable Peter Goodman said: 'I am shocked and deeply saddened by the untimely and tragic death of my friend, and former High Sheriff, Annie Hall.          'Annie was a great leader in Derbyshire in both industry and on the civic front. She will be hugely missed.'          Her family also released a statement, saying: 'It is with great sadness that we, the family of Annie Hall, report her sudden passing.          'We are in great shock and grieving.'          Pauline Latham, former MP for Mid Derbyshire, paid tribute to Mrs Hall in a post on Twitter.          'My heart goes out to the family and friends of former Derbyshire High Sheriff Annie Hall who died tragically in yesterday's floods,' she said.          'She was a great champion of our county and will be sorely missed.'          Mr Corbyn is due to visit flood-hit areas of South Yorkshire on Saturday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Matlock in Derbyshire on Friday.          During the visit, Mr Johnson said the widespread flooding across the UK 'is not looking like something we need to escalate to the level of a national emergency'.          Mr Johnson said the Government will 'certainly stand by ready to help' after the country was hit by a deluge of water described as 'almost biblical' by residents in Toll Bar, near Doncaster.          Severe warnings were issued for the flood-hit North and Midlands after devastating torrents left streets waist-deep in water.          Snow fell in parts of Wales with some predicted to drop in south-west Scotland and Cumbria on Saturday.          Mr Petanga said most of the snowfall will be across the hills in Wales.          'It's falling from the sky and a little bit is settling on higher grounds,' he said.          'It shouldn't accumulate too much. It's unlikely to cause too much of an issue.'          Temperatures were predicted to go down to minus 8C in parts of Scotland on Saturday with the potential of more snow on higher grounds, he added.          Yorkshire and the Midlands were among the areas worst affected by heavy downpours on Thursday and Friday.          The body of the woman was recovered in Darley Dale, near Matlock, at about 10.40am on Friday, Derbyshire Police said. She was reported to have been swept away by floodwater in Rowsley in the early hours.          The heavy rain forced the closure of train lines in north England on Friday with several lines still affected on Saturday.          Parts of Britain which have been battered by heavy floods are set to receive respite with dry weather and sunshine forecast.          Mr Petanga said the weather on Saturday would be 'much improved' for the areas which were affected by heavy downpours and floods on Friday.          'Those areas are going to escape with dry weather,' he said.          Mr Petanga said parts of the country experienced a frosty start to the weekend with minus 7C recorded in Braemar, Scotland, on Saturday morning.          'It's a cold start but there will be some sunshine throughout the day and a lot of dry weather,' he said.          'Once the fog lifts many eastern areas will have quite a nice day today with some sunshine.'          There were two yellow rain warnings, with one in place from 11am to midnight stretching from Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, to Eastbourne and Portsmouth and another from 5am to 8pm covering Northern Ireland from Ballycastle to Newry.          Northern Ireland could see up to 50mm of rain on Saturday, Mr Petanga said.          Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn visited flood-hit areas of South Yorkshire on Saturday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Matlock in Derbyshire on Friday.          During the visit, Mr Johnson said the widespread flooding across the UK 'is not looking like something we need to escalate to the level of a national emergency'.          Mr Johnson said the Government will 'certainly stand by ready to help' after the country was hit by deluge of water described as 'almost biblical' by residents in Toll Bar, near Doncaster.          His visit came after the death of a woman who was reportedly swept away by floodwater as parts of the Midlands and northern England were battered by a month's worth of rain in one day.          Mr Johnson attended a briefing from emergency personnel including members of the East Midlands Ambulance Service and Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service at Matlock Police Station as he arrived in the Midlands to see the impact of the weather.          He also met some of the police officers who had helped with the flooding. Speaking at the meeting, the Prime Minister said: 'You must have been at it all day. Thank you very much. I remember Whaley Bridge, you did an amazing job. Absolutely fantastic. Very sad about the fatality this morning.'          He then helped mop up flood water inside a Specsavers opticians during his visit to Matlock. He told staff: 'You're lucky none of your stock has been damaged.'\n",

      "Nevada county approves ‘Storm Area 51’ events\n",
      "PIOCHE, Nev. — A rural Nevada county has given final go-aheads to two events centered around a “Storm Area 51” drive that began as an internet joke.          Lincoln County commissioners accepted a promoter’s plan to host 5,000 people at a music festival in tiny Hiko, and an inn owner’s effort to let perhaps 10,000 camp on her property in Rachel, the town closest to the once top-secret Area 51 military base.          The board last month drafted an emergency declaration, with the sheriff planning to team resources with the state and neighboring counties ahead of Sept. 20-22 events inspired by the internet invitation.          Commissioners and Sheriff Kerry Lee say promoters’ plans to bring in food, water and entertainment could help people survive in the desolate desert nearly three hours’ drive from Las Vegas.\n",

      "Palm Beach County Sending Reusable Masks to Households\n",
      "Florida’s Palm Beach County will send every household two reusable masks as part of its greater effort to slow the spread of the Chinese coronavirus and enforce the county’s mask directive, Mayor Dave Kerner (D) announced on Friday.          Kerner said the county, which ordered 1.5 million masks, will send them to the roughly 660,000 households. The move will cost the county $2.5 million, but there is no set date on when they will arrive and be distributed to residents.          “We want to make sure that every member of this community, no matter where you live, has access to the personal protective equipment that is needed to keep yourself safe and members of the public and community at large safe,” County Mayor Dave Kerner said Friday.          He said he is “pushing the pedal to the metal” on getting the masks into the hands of residents. They will reportedly begin to go out in July, according to the Palm Beach Post.          “If the doctors say we need to load up on [personal protective equipment] then we’re going to get it to them as soon as possible,” Kerner stated.          Palm Beach County commissioners unanimously approved of the ordinance, which went into effect on Thursday.          Facial coverings must be worn by all persons, other than those specifically exempted, while obtaining any good or service or otherwise visiting or working in any business or establishment, including entering, exiting, and otherwise moving around within the establishment. Facial coverings must be worn by all persons in public places where social distancing in accordance with CDC guidelines is not possible or not being practiced.          Individuals under the age of two and those with medical conditions are among those who are not required to wear a face covering. Violators could be subject to fines.          Palm Beach County has experienced a higher concentration of cases than many of the counties in Florida, accounting for over 10 percent of the state’s overall coronavirus cases. It has reported 12,498 positive cases since March 1, according to the state’s coronavirus dashboard Saturday morning.          Similarly, the St. Augustine City Commission voted unanimously on Friday to require those in the City of St. Augustine — a historic city in Northeast Florida — to wear masks, with a handful of standard exceptions. The order went into effect Saturday. Penalties include a fine of up to $500, according to the resolution.\n",

      "Suspect ID'd in slaying of transgender woman found in burning car\n",
      "Police in south Florida say they have identified a suspect in the slaying of a transgender woman found dead in a burning car this month. The Hendry County Sheriff's office is searching for 29-year-old Jamson Richemond in the September 4 murder of Bee Love Slater.          The office is investigating the case as a possible hate crime, Hendry County Sheriff's spokeswoman Capt. Harelle told CBS News, but they haven't yet confirmed a motive.          Richemond is also believed to be connected to the killing of Jamal Hubert, a 30-year-old father found dead in a South Bay canal in June, Harelle said.          Authorities have not said how Slater or Hubert died, or why they believe Richemond is linked to the cases. He has not been charged in either death.          On September 4, police responding to a 911 call reporting a car fully engulfed in flames in Clewiston, Florida, found 23-year-old Slater's body inside. Her remains were burned beyond recognition, Harelle has said.          Hendry County Sheriff Steve Whidden told news outlets his department is working diligently to solve the crimes.          \"We are following up on every lead, every bit of information we get,\" Whidden told NBC affiliate WBBH. \"This homicide has been one of the most gruesome homicides I've seen.\"          Slater's best friend, Kenard Wade, told CBS Fort Myers affiliate WINK he believes Slater was targeted as a member of the LGBTQ community. He told the station Slater, who lived in Pahokee, about 30 miles from where her body was found, had received threats the day she was found slain. She reportedly told him she wanted to leave town to avoid trouble.          ''She had a really, really good heart,\" Wade told WINK. \"She would never harm anyone, never put anyone in harm's way. How could someone go to that extreme to get rid of her?\"          On Friday, deputies searched a home about two and a half miles from where Slater's body was found. Deputies were seen removing bags of evidence from the home, which the Palm Beach Post reports is Richemond's last known address.          Social media has played a key role in the investigation, according to the sheriff. Speaking to WBBH, Whidden said deputies were investigating a Facebook post made before the crime that read, \"Somebody need to kill B. Love.\" He told the station the post was linked to the home.          \"A lot of the stuff we're looking into is based on social media,\" Whidden said.          According to the Human Rights Campaign, Slater is at least the 18th transgender person slain in 2019. The advocacy group tracked 26 killings of transgender people last year; the majority of the victims transgender women of color. In June, the American Medical Association called fatal attacks against transgender people of color an \"epidemic.\"\n",

      "Young mom still missing, last seen walking out of Kentucky woods\n",
      "Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.          For many, Mother’s Day is a day to celebrate their mom or mother-figure; for others, the holiday can highlight a painful absence in their lives.          This Mother’s Day, Kim Jones had to talk to her four-year-old niece about why her mom, Samantha Sperry, still isn’t home.          Samantha, 25, was reportedly last seen in Graves County, Kentucky on the morning of Wednesday, March 28, 2018, according to Graves County Chief Deputy Sheriff Davant Ramage. Authorities told Dateline that the last people to see the young mother alive were Rhen Hendrickson, Samantha’s boyfriend, and Rhen’s biological father, Dusty Holder.          Dateline reached out to both Rhen and Dusty for comment but had not heard back by Monday evening.          “We were told by Rhen that Samantha and him showed up where Dusty lives [on that Tuesday afternoon. And there] may or may not have been an argument between Samantha and Rhen,” Chief Deputy Sheriff Ramage told Dateline, adding that Dusty claims the argument took place, but Rhen claims it didn’t.          Dusty later told police, that while Rhen decided to go back to Samantha’s Murray, Kentucky home to spend the night, he and Samantha decided to go four-wheeling in the woods near Dusty’s house. They became stuck in the mud close to nightfall, according to Dusty, so the two of them decided to spend the night on the four-wheeler.          “They left the four-wheeler running to use the heat from the engine. They do this all night. The four-wheeler eventually runs out of gas. And in the morning, they walk out of the woods,” Chief Deputy Sheriff Ramage explained. “Dusty said he went one direction, but she went another.”          That’s the last time anyone saw Samantha. Police say Dusty told them he didn’t question why Samantha wanted to walk a different direction, because he was wet, cold and tired from having spent the night in the woods.          Samantha’s sister Kim says she and family members had been calling and texting Samantha’s cell phone, but her phone was off. Rhen was looking for Samantha, too, since she hadn’t returned home from four-wheeling with Dusty.          Police say later that day, after Dusty told Rhen what happened, Rhen placed a troubling phone call to his mother.          “He called his mom and said he was going to kill himself,” Chief Deputy Sheriff Ramage told Dateline. Police were told of Rhen’s situation and began looking into the case.          Samantha’s sister Kim told Dateline that their brother, Tyler, is a member of the volunteer fire department.          “He heard the call go out and was told it was Rhen and called to tell us about it,” Kim said. That night, search crews found an abandoned car on Dooms Chapel Road at the KY-131 intersection just south of Symsonia, Kentucky. Kim says Tyler became very concerned when they found out the car was Samantha's Ford Taurus.          Samantha’s sister Kim says their mother’s worry increased even more that night when she called Samantha’s work and learned her daughter hadn’t shown up for her 9:00 p.m. shift at McDonald’s. Police told Dateline that Dusty also called them Wednesday evening to say Samantha was missing.          By this point, it was already dark out, so police didn’t look any further for Rhen till the next morning. Police explained to Dateline that they have “had interactions with Rhen before where he was violent and armed,” so they held off searching for him until daylight on Thursday.          That day, police posted on Facebook to say an investigation was underway to locate both Rhen and Samantha.          During ground searches with volunteers and authorities, police also located the four-wheeler that Dusty says he and Samantha spent the night on earlier that week. They found the keys to Samantha’s car on the ground, but were unable to find any evidence of foul play, or anything that would lead them to locate Samantha or Rhen.          “We’re in a wooded area, a swamp,” Chief Deputy Sheriff Ramage told Dateline. “It’s not like going to a crime scene at a home or building, where evidence would be easily seen or noticed.”          That Sunday, April 1, police say Rhen walked up to his father’s house of his own accord, looking for help.          “He was dehydrated and hypothermic, and was transported to a local hospital for treatment of his injuries,” a Graves County Sheriff’s Office news release said. Samantha was not with him.          Chief Deputy Sheriff Ramage told Dateline police have questioned Rhen and Dusty multiple times about Samantha’s disappearance and said both men passed polygraph tests on the subject.          Samantha’s sister Kim says Samantha had recently separated from her husband, and shares joint custody of their kids with him. Police told Dateline they have interviewed the husband and Samantha’s mother and stepfather multiple times, but haven’t learned any significant information from those interviews.          Kim believes foul play is involved in her sister’s disappearance.          “She couldn’t have gotten lost in the woods,” Kim told Dateline. “We are out in the woods all the time. This is our hometown. She couldn’t have gotten lost.”          Chief Deputy Sheriff Ramage says police have since executed search warrants on both Samantha and Dusty’s homes, but were unable to find anything of significance. However, Ramage says that, one week later, a Murray police officer did find blood in an undisclosed part of Samantha’s house.          “Samples of the blood were taken, and all that was sent to the lab,” Chief Deputy Sheriff Ramage told Dateline. “At this point, we don’t have anything back on that. And we don’t know when we will get results back on that.”          Family members and authorities have also since worked with several search and rescue groups and K-9 teams to search the Kaler Bottoms area where Samantha was last seen.          Chief Deputy Sheriff Ramagetold Dateline police don’t have any physical evidence at this time to show that Samantha went missing under suspicious circumstances.          “Do we feel that it smells bad? It looks funny? Yes,” he said. “But what we have right now is just a missing persons case.”          Kim told Dateline she is hoping for the best outcome, but knows she has to be realistic about the situation.          “I don’t think my sister will come home safe and alive,” she said. “She would have contacted us by now. She wouldn’t have done this to us.”          West Kentucky Crime Stoppers and the family of Samantha Sperry are offering a $5,000 reward to the person or persons who provide information to law enforcement which results in discovering Samantha’s location, or results in the arrest and conviction of the person or persons involved with her disappearance. Samantha is described as being 5’6” and weighs about 125 lbs. She has hazel eyes and blonde hair, and was last seen wearing gray sweatpants and a hoodie. Anyone with information on Samantha’s whereabouts is asked to contact the Graves County Sheriff’s Office at 270-247-4501.\n",

      "For $295, This ‘Sheriff’ Will Teach You to Be an Ass Like Him\n",
      "Never mind the tens of thousands of preventable deaths from COVID-19.          Never mind the many thousands of COVID survivors who will suffer lasting, perhaps lifelong, damage to their lungs or hearts.          Never mind those left with circulatory complications that can result in the loss of fingers, toes, or entire limbs.          Never mind thousands of others suffering neurological damage with an array of cognitive and psychological effects, including terrifying hallucinations.          Never mind reports that the wearing of masks and observance of social distancing seems to have begun to temper the spike of coronavirus infections in Arizona, Texas, and California.          A former Arizona sheriff is ready to ignore all that and charge people $295 to attend a virtual seminar where he will coach them on how to oppose those very lifesaving mandates.          Onetime Graham County Sheriff Richard Mack is the 67-year-old head of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Public Safety Officers Association (CSPOA). The “CSPOA Certification Class” he plans to begin teaching on Thursday will enable those who pay the fee to “connect with like minded people and help each other create more Liberty across the country!”          “Are You Ready To Create A Liberty Movement With Us?” the website asks. “End Tyranny In Your City & State... Help Restore Liberty Across The Country...End Mandated Masks.. End Mandated Vaccines.”          Participants will “get to ask Sheriff Mack questions , which means you can get knowledge from the first Sheriff in US history to sue the federal government and win in the Supreme Court!”          Mack did indeed sue the federal government back in 1994, challenging the constitutionality of the Brady Bill’s requirement for local sheriffs to run background checks at their own expense for gun-buyers. And he did in fact push it all the way to a successful 5-4 ruling in the Supreme Court.          At the time of that victory, Mack was in his second and final term as sheriff in his native Graham County. He left office in 1997, but continued to bill himself as Sheriff Mack as he became an activist against all forms of gun control. He was, after all, an inductee into the NRA Hall of Fame as well as a onetime NRA Law Officer of the Year.          He also became a passionate voice against such “big government” measures as Obamacare.          “The States do not have to take or support or pay for Obamacare or anything else from Washington D.C. The States are not subject to federal direction,” he declared on his website.          One hitch about being a self-appointed champion of liberty was that he did not have health insurance when he suffered a heart attack in 2015. His wife then fell ill, requiring multiple surgeries. He started a GoFundMe page.          “Because he and his wife are self-employed they do not have insurance to pay for their medical bills,” a friend wrote.          “Sheriff Mack credits you with helping him to avoid bankruptcy and enabling him to resume his work with CSPOA and says he doesn’t know what he would have done without you,” the GoFundMe announced.          The page reported a new development in Mack’s life that carried what he had apparently come to recognize as a necessary benefit:          “He has accepted a new teaching position which provides health insurance and plans to make an even stronger recovery and work for better health in the year ahead, like the rest of us.”          Mack is now teaching American history with full benefits at a Phoenix high school high he prefers not to name. Any concern he has for the health of others is eclipsed by his view that mask mandates and social distancing requirements are dire threats to his constitutional rights. His face will be uncovered when he reports to the school on Wednesday for training in preparation for an online semester commencing next month.          “I’m sure some of the other teachers will be upset,” Mack told The Daily Beast on Monday. “I’ll tell them I’m one of the huddled masses yearning to breathe free… I'll just say, ‘It’s an individual choice. I don't tell you what to wear and don’t you tell me what to wear. And if you don’t like it, stay away from me.’”          Never mind that he and his fellow teachers will be preparing to teach an online semester due to a virus spike fueled in part by people who failed to wear masks and observe social distancing. Never mind that COVID has claimed the lives of such stellar Arizona teachers as Kimberly Byrd of Superior.          “ I’m not here to talk about the efficacy of wearing a mask,” Mack told The Daily Beast on Monday, the start of a work week where he would both return to school and begin his CSPOA seminar. “I’m here to talk about liberty.”          He added, “To force me to wear a mask, force me to social distance, they don’t have the authority.”          He was not persuaded by the argument that this was a public health issue, despite the near-universal medical opinion that masks and social distancing can curtail the spread of the virus that has killed nearly 150,000 Americans.          “The Constitution protects us from our own best interests,” he actually said.          A considerable number of sheriffs across the country share his view of mask mandates. But he was not able to give a reporter an immediate tally of how many are presently affiliated with CSPOA.          The ex-lawman who still calls himself sheriff said that he personally refuses to observe the city and county mask mandates when he walks around the malls in his area.          He was asked if he worried that he was endangering the health of others.          “I don't want to endanger my neighbor, but it’s not my responsibility to take care of my neighbor,” he said. “I still see my next door neighbor and he’s not wearing a mask, and neither am I.”          He offered advice to those who do not want to be around him and others who refuse to wear a mask that suggested his liberty comes before that of others.          As for himself, he insists that he no longer shakes hands with people and uses hand sanitizer and keeps a certain distance when he can. But he will not wear a mask no matter who it might endanger.          “I’m going to go about my life as best I can as a free American,” he said.          That includes when he goes to his school on Wednesday to prepare for another semester teaching kids forced to learn online at least partly because too many people in Arizona, like Mack, chose “liberty” over public health.          “I’d rather be doing it in person,” he said. “I absolutely love the kids.”\n",

      "Google Earth Uncovers Submerged Car, Skeleton of Person Missing for 22 Years\n",
      "The skeletal remains of a man missing for 22 years were discovered after someone noticed what appeared to be a submerged car on Google Earth. When authorities came to investigate at the gated community in Wellington, Florida, they found a 1994 Saturn SL at the bottom of a pond in the backyard of resident Barry Fay. Inside, authorities discovered the remains of William Earl Moldt, who was last heard from in 1997. “The vehicle’s exterior was heavily calcified and was obviously in the water for a significant amount of time,” the Sheriff’s Office said. The community where Fay’s house now stands was only under construction at the time of Moldt’s disappearance.          “I called the former owner of my house and asked if she knew about this,” Fay told the . “She was shocked.” According to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, Moldt, then 40, was driving home from a night club around 9:30 p.m. when he disappeared.\n",

      "DA in Rayshard Brooks case ousted in runoff after 23 years in office\n",
      "(CNN) Paul Howard, who handled the Ray Lewis murder case, Atlanta school cheating scandal and the police killing of Rayshard Brooks during his lengthy tenure, has been ousted as Fulton County's top prosecutor.          Opponent Fani Willis, who prosecuted cases for years in the county district attorney's office, outpaced her old boss in June's Democratic primary, but neither contestant received 50% of the vote, spurring Tuesday's runoff.          Willis trounced the incumbent Howard on Tuesday by a 3-to-1 margin, according to county election results . With almost 91% of precincts reporting, Willis had more than 43,000 votes, about 73% of the tally, to Howard's 15,800.          There were no Republican candidates on the ballot during the June primary.          \"What is important to me is protecting the people of this community, and I want to make sure that when her first day in office is a reality that she's able to continue to protect the people who live in Fulton County,\" he said.          Howard has much to be proud of, he said. Not only is he the first elected African American district attorney in Georgia, but he won re-election on five occasions.          He leaves office under a pall of accusations, but he didn't address those in his concession speech. Rather, he touted his success in tackling violent crime and homicides, reducing the Fulton County Jail population and making cities safer during his 23 years in office.          \"I came with pride and I'm leaving with pride,\" he said, explaining he is particularly proud of his efforts to prosecute police officers charged with killing Black men.          He will continue to combat police brutality in his post-prosecutor life, he said.          \"It is really rough when you are a man and you have to tell your kids to watch out for the police and be careful. I don't think that's the way we ought to live in this country and so I'm going to be working to change that,\" he said.          \"My hope has always been that we would have one system of justice, that it would be the same system for the police as it is with any defendants,\" he said Tuesday night. \"I'm hoping that Ms. Willis will continue that tradition -- that when a policeman is involved in some misconduct that the DA is the person that's responsible.\"          \"I would like to thank all the elected officials who really had the courage to stand against an incumbent and for what was right,\" she said. \"I want to thank the voters of this county for believing in me. Tonight's a good night. We made 'herstory.' I am just humbled and thank you.\"          The good and the bad          Howard had previously said he would be \"totally exonerated\" in both matters.          \"I think people can see through it,\" he said. \"Guy's been in office for 23 years and then a month or two before the election these harassment suits are filed.\"\n",

      "Safety commission has dubbed crib bumpers a suffocation hazard\n",
      "A common adornment of the well-apportioned baby crib — protective cloth “bumpers” — have been linked to dozens of accidental infant suffocation deaths in recent decades, a new investigation revealed.          Padded crib bumpers have been implicated by medical examiners in at least 35 baby deaths across the country, the Washington Post reported.          The National Institutes of Health, American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention all have warned the public against using bumpers for years, the paper reported.          Still, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission has failed, until now, to rule that padded bumpers were to blame in the deaths.          The commission has a new acting chairman — longtime commissioner Robert Adler — who told the paper he plans to invite outside experts to come in and debate the safety of crib bumpers at a public hearing in early 2020.\n",

      "CDC website lists over 3,700 virus deaths caused by 'intentional and unintentional injury, poisoning and other adverse events'\n",
      "The website for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists 3,721 coronavirus deaths that are characterized as \"intentional and unintentional injury, poisoning and other adverse events.\"          “We all saw the motorcycle accident with COVID on the death certificate,” political analyst Phil Kerpen tweeted. “A rarity? Not really The CDC reports that 3,721 death certificates in the COVID count also list ‘intentional and unintentional injury, poisoning and other adverse events.’”          Kerpen added, “And these accidental injury deaths are a bigger share of the COVID death certificate counts in the younger age groups. 9.1% of under 25 and 8.6% of 25-34.”          The motorcycle accident Kerpen is referring to took place in Florida, and a health official in the state that the man died in the accident but was listed on the coronavirus death count.          “I don’t think so. I have to double-check,” Dr. Raul Pino, a health officer in Orange County, Florida, said when asked if the death had been removed from the coronavirus count. “We were arguing, discussing, or trying to argue with the state. Not because of the numbers ⁠— it’s 100 … it doesn’t make any difference if it's 99 ⁠— but the fact that the individual didn’t die from COVID-19 … died in the crash. But you could actually argue that it could have been the COVID-19 that caused him to crash. I don’t know the conclusion of that one.”          Across the country, other questions have been raised about the death count, including from a coroner in Colorado who that a man who died from alcohol poisoning was listed as a coronavirus death, and coroners in Pennsylvania similar concerns.          Health officials in Texas recently over 3,000 coronavirus deaths that had be listed as “probable” who never tested positive for the virus, leading one news reporter in Texas to ask the question, “What other departments make this same mistake?”\n",

      "India surpasses Russia as country with third-most reported coronavirus cases\n",
      "India's recent spikes in coronavirus cases have made it the country with the third-most reported infections, trailing only the United States and Brazil.          India now has more than 720,000 cases, and more than 20,000 people who have become infected have died. This beats out the official count in Russia, where there have been more than 700,000 cases and more than 10,000 deaths.          Over the weekend, India reported its highest single-day spike, with 25,000 new cases. Monuments, including the Taj Mahal, that were expected to reopen to tourists this week have remained closed indefinitely, according to NPR.          The hardest-hit parts of the South Asian country, which has a population that exceeds 1.3 billion people, remain its urban centers of New Delhi and Mumbai, leaving hospitals overcrowded and prompting makeshift medical centers to be constructed in convention centers.          After the nationwide caseload rose to 500,000 late last month, Indian officials made efforts to screen New Delhi residents for any symptoms of COVID-19.          Though India now has the third-highest number of cases, it ranks eighth in its death toll, according to Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. leads the world in cases and deaths, seeing nearly 3 million cases of the coronavirus and 130,000 deaths. Brazil follows in both cases and deaths, seeing more than 1.5 million cases and more than 65,000 deaths. Russia, now ranking fourth in cases, still has a lower reported death toll than India.          Russian President Vladimir Putin previously praised the country's handling of the coronavirus, referring to its disparity in deaths compared to its caseload. Russia has a population of about 144 million people.\n",

      "Between 1,900 and 3,200 people catching Covid-19 per day in England\n",
      "Between 1,900 and 3,200 people are catching the coronavirus every day in England — but the speed at which the outbreak is shrinking has 'levelled off', according to data.          The estimate is lower than last week, when two separate projections from King's College London experts and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) ranged from between 3,200 to 3,800.          King's College's COVID Symptom Tracker app predicts 1,978 people in England are getting struck down daily. The ONS, whose estimate is based on population swab testing, puts the figure at approximately 3,142.          But statisticians cautioned the number of people infected with Covid-19 could have even gone up — from 33,000 people a fortnight ago to 51,000 on June 21, around 0.09 per cent of the population (one in 1,100 people).          The ONS explained that the extremely small sample size — the number is based only on 14 positive tests, up from 10 last week — is likely to have swayed the estimate. Experts stopped short of saying the outbreak had rebounded and started to rise again, instead saying there was no evidence it was either growing nor shrinking.          Government advisers today claimed the R rate for the UK and England remains between 0.7 and 0.9 for the third week in a row. But they admitted it could be as high as 1.0 in the North West. Number 10's scientific advisory panel SAGE today also revealed the growth rate — how the number of new daily cases is changing day-by-day — is still between minus four and minus two per cent.          Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week dramatically unwound the coronavirus lockdown, bringing the country out of 'hibernation' — with a return for pubs, haircuts and weddings and family and friends getting the green light to meet up indoors for the first time in months.          The Prime Minister said he wanted to 'make life easier' after an 'incredibly tough time' with bars, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers in England able to get back up and running from July 4 - dubbed 'Super Saturday'.          Today's data from the ONS, part of a set published every week, revealed that 0.09 per cent of the population was thought to be infected with coronavirus at any given point between June 8 and June 21.          This is one in every 1,100 people, and equates to a total 51,000, it said. It is based on 14 positive tests from a total of 24,256 carried out across the country.          The estimate has risen from 0.06 per cent last week, which was the lowest one so far. It remains lower, however, than every other week since the data began, leaving experts hesitant to say the virus was rebounding.          In its report the semi-independent body said: 'Modelling of the trend over time suggests that the decline in the number of people in England testing positive has levelled off in recent weeks.          'These estimates suggest the percentage testing positive has clearly decreased over time since our first measurement on 26 April, and this downward trend has now flattened.          'The [possible ranges] overlap with the previous two time periods. This suggests that the actual number of individuals testing positive in the period 8 June to 21 June could be higher or lower than in the two previous periods. We therefore do not at this point have evidence that the current trend is anything other than flat.'          The ONS data added that there are thought to be four new infections per 10,000 people each week. This was a total of 22,000 new infections per week - the lowest number predicted so far and a 33 per cent drop from 33,000 in last week's data.          The reason ONS's estimate of total infections rose but the daily estimate fell was that it changed the way it records the data, no longer using overlapping data periods - using each week twice -as it does for the other measures.          The report added: 'This means that this analysis cannot be directly compared with that presented in previous bulletins.'          King's College London's COVID Symptom Tracker app also estimates that cases in the UK have shrunk by a third in the space of a week. Its estimate for Britain as a whole has seen daily infections fall from 3,612 to 2,341 in a week.          The researchers, working alongside health tech company ZOE, have collected data on symptoms and test results from one million UK citizens since the crisis began to unfold.          Last week they used this data to estimate that there were 3,612 people catching the virus every day in Britain — 35 per cent more than today's figure of 2,341.          Most of the new cases — 1,978 — are appearing in England, the team said, along with 241 per day in Wales and 122 in Scotland. No estimates are made for Northern Ireland, however.          The data suggests the virus is spreading most widely in the Midlands, which is experiencing 716 daily cases, above the 330 in the North East and Yorkshire and 319 in the East of England.          The scientists running the project claimed the steady decline showed the crisis was 'tailing off' but warned people need to be 'cautious when heading back to normal life'.          Professor Tim Spector, an epidemiologist at King's, said: 'With lockdown being eased over the last few weeks and more changes soon to come it’s interesting to see that we are now seeing a tail off in the decline.          'With Covid-19 very much still in the population it’s really important that the UK continues to be cautious when it comes heading back to normal life.          'If we want to make this lifting of lockdown a success everyone needs to educate themselves on Covid-19 such as knowing all 19 symptoms that are associated with Covid-19.          'Especially important is the first few days when cases are being missed when it is important to self isolate if unwell and getting tested rapidly.          'Also using technology like our app will give us valuable data and help us build a clearer picture of how much Covid-19 is in the population at any one given time, which will help us catch any potential second waves sooner rather than later.'          The team running the mobile app 'Covid-19 Symptom Tracker' have been collecting data from people self-reporting symptoms and test results for months.          Data in this week's update was taken from one million people's self-reports on their own health, and the results of on 14,422 swab tests taken by app users.          People are asked to log on regularly to report whether they have any signs of illness or whether they feel healthy.          They are asked to get tested if they have symptoms that may be linked to Covid-19, and to report the results of the test.          Because of this, the app cannot reliably track the number of people who are catching the virus but not developing symptoms, which may be thousands more.          The estimate does not include Northern Ireland or care homes, where the virus is still thought to be spreading, meaning the true rate could be much higher.          The Office for National Statistics, the governmental stats department, collects data differently and uses regular testing of a representative sample of the population.          ONS experts then estimate the levels of infection based on how the proportion of that group testing positive changes over time.          Last week the ONS suggested there were between 3,800 new infections per day in England per day — which was in line with the COVID Symptom Tracker's estimates last week.          The estimate was based on testing in a representative sample of almost 25,000 people across England, only 10 of whom swabbed positive.          But the drawback of the ONS data is that it does not include people who are diagnosed in hospitals or care homes. The COVID Symptom Tracker does not rule them out.          Dr Paul Birrell a researcher at the University of Cambridge, who has been working with Public Health England on different predictions, said none of the estimates are perfect.          He explains: 'The symptom tracker tracks only symptomatic infection. You would need to add the asymptomatic proportion onto this to get a number comparable with our estimate. Unfortunately, this proportion isn't well known.          'Analysis of data from the cruise ship outbreaks suggest this is about 50 per cent, whereas the ONS study says that as many as 70 per cent are asymptomatic.'          Department of Health statistics yesterday revealed just 653 Brits were diagnosed with coronavirus, in the lowest daily jump since before the lockdown was imposed on March 23.          But these figures never show the true scale of the outbreak because many people who catch the virus never swab positive because they don't realise they are sick, couldn't get a test, or the result was wrong.\n",

      "White House: Coronavirus Numbers Appear to Be Stabilizing\n",
      "President Donald Trump and his coronavirus task force on Sunday noted that the number of infections and deaths from the virus is stabilizing in many areas, offering Americans some hope.          “As you can see from the hopeful signs in Italy and Spain, where we see, finally, new cases and deaths declining, it is giving us hope of what our future could be,” Dr. Deborah Birx said during the White House coronavirus press briefing on Sunday.          She said that both countries had completed four weeks of social distancing, which had a positive effect on driving down the numbers.          “We can look like that,” she said, urging Americans to continue following the presidential guidelines.          Italy reported its lowest daily death toll in two weeks, and deaths have fallen for three straight days in Spain.          In a series of slides, Birx noted at the White House that there is even some stabilization in large metro areas such as Detroit and Louisiana.          New York also reported its first decline in deaths from coronavirus.          Trump cheered on the American people for their efforts.          “I will say that they are doing maybe a better job than we all thought were possible,” he said, pointing to the empty streets in New York City as evidence that people were taking the guidelines seriously.          Vice President Mike Pence also voiced hope about the “glimmers of progress” in the numbers.          “The truth is we are starting to see cases, and most importantly losses as hospitalizations begin to stabilize,” he said.          He cheered on Americans for continuing to follow the 60-day guidelines to slow the spread of the virus.          “Make no mistake about it, I want to say to the American people: if that holds, if that is happening, it is because of what all of you are doing,” he said.          Reporters during the briefing voiced skepticism about the positive message sent by the president and his staff, but even Dr. Anthony Fauci took the podium to say Americans should continue finding hope in the numbers.          “It seems to be inherently contradictory, but it is not,” he said.          Fauci said that the “light at the end of the tunnel” is still about two weeks away, but that Americans should see that their commitment to social distancing is working.          “If we start seeing now a flattening or stabilization of cases, what you are hearing about — potential light at the end of the tunnel — does not take away from the fact that tomorrow and the next day will look really bad,” he said.\n",

      "Brazil edges toward being next big coronavirus hot spot\n",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil is emerging as potentially the next big hot spot for the coronavirus amid President Jair Bolsonaro’s insistence that it is just a \"little flu” and that there is no need for the sharp restrictions that have slowed the infection’s spread in Europe and the U.S.          As some U.S. states and European countries moved gradually Monday to ease their limits on movement and commerce, the intensifying outbreak in Brazil — Latin America's biggest country, with 211 million people — pushed some hospitals to the breaking point, with signs that a growing number of victims are now dying at home.          “We have all the conditions here for the pandemic to become much more serious,\" said Paulo Brandão, a virologist at the University of Sao Paulo.          Brazil officially reported about 4,500 deaths and almost 67,000 confirmed infections. But the true numbers there, as in many other countries, are believed to be vastly higher given the lack of testing and the many people without severe symptoms who haven’t sought hospital care.          Some scientists said over 1 million in Brazil are probably infected. The country is heading into winter, which can worsen respiratory illnesses.          Worldwide, the death toll topped 210,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The number of dead in the U.S. surpassed 55,000 — close to the 58,000 U.S. troops killed during the Vietnam War. Italy, Britain, Spain and France accounted for more than 20,000 deaths each.          — U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that deaths in the United States from the coronavirus could reach as high as 70,000, after putting the number at 60,000 several times earlier this month.          — The Trump administration worked to draw up new guidelines for how restaurants, schools, churches and businesses can safely reopen. The administration also unveiled a “blueprint” for states to scale up their virus testing in the coming week. Still, there were doubts from public health experts that the new testing targets were sufficient.          — The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded the list of people to be prioritized for virus testing to include those who show no symptoms but are in high-risk settings such as nursing homes.          — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to work after a bout with the virus and warned strongly against easing his own country’s lockdown too soon: “I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life.\"          — New York canceled its Democratic presidential primary, set for June 23, since Bernie Sanders has already conceded the nomination to Joe Biden. In a bit of encouraging news, the state reported 337 deaths for the lowest daily count this month, down from nearly 800 almost three weeks ago.          — Massachusetts recorded its 3,000th known death from the virus. The state is “still in the surge and very much in the fight against COVID-19,” Gov. Charlie Baker said.          In Brazil, Bolsonaro has disputed the seriousness of the coronavirus and said people need to resume their lives to prevent an economic meltdown. But most state governors in the country have adopted restrictions to slow the spread and pushed people to stay at home.          In mid-April, Bolsonaro fired his popular health minister after a series of disagreements over efforts to contain the virus, replacing him with an advocate for reopening the economy. Residents protested, leaning out their windows to bang pots and pans.          Medical officials in Rio de Janeiro and at least four other major cities have warned that their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse or too overwhelmed to take any more patients.          Officials in Sao Paulo — the largest city in South America, a tightly packed metropolitan area of over 21 million residents, many living in poverty — have issued death certificates over the past two weeks for 236 people who succumbed at home, double the number before the outbreak, according to the SAMU paramedic service.          Manaus, an Amazon city of 1.8 million, recorded 142 deaths on Sunday, the most yet, including 41 who died at home. In the main cemetery, workers have been digging mass graves. Brazil's funeral industry warned last week that the city was running out of coffins and \"there could soon be corpses left on corners.”          In the U.S., the governors of Nevada and Colorado announced their states will join California, Oregon and Washington state in coordinating their reopenings. The governors of all five states are Democrats.          In Georgia, where Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has let businesses reopen, restaurants received the go-ahead to resume dine-in service as long as they follow certain restrictions, including keeping tables 6 feet (2 meters) apart.          At Plucked Up Chicken & Biscuits in Columbus, Georgia, eight regulars showed up in the morning to have their coffee and breakfast and “chatted at each other across the room,” manager Alesha Webster said. But only 10 customers could be inside at a time, well below the capacity of 45.          Alex Brounstein, owner of the Atlanta-based chain Grindhouse Killer Burgers, had no plans to reopen right away. “You’re talking about people putting their mouths on things in your restaurant. You now have dirty dishes going back into your kitchen. To me, it’s just completely illogical,” he said.          Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday outlined a slow reopening, allowing restaurants, retailers, movie theaters and malls to start letting customers trickle into their establishments starting Friday. The state has one of the world's largest economies.          Technology is likely to play an important role in helping countries ease their restrictions. Many countries, including Italy, France, Switzerland and Britain, are working on virus-tracking apps and other means of reducing the labor-intensive task of tracing infected people's contacts.          In Australia, with about 80 COVID-19 deaths, 1.1 million of the country's 26 million people downloaded a new contact-tracing app within 12 hours of its becoming available.          Biller and De Sousa reported from Rio de Janeiro and Geller from New York. Associated Press journalists around the world contributed to this report.\n",

      "Germany now has 150 confirmed cases\n",
      "The total number of coronavirus cases in the US jumped by two dozen over the weekend, as the first two deaths from the outbreak were confirmed.          New cases of the virus were announced in Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state, and Florida on Sunday, bringing the US total to 89.          The new cases prompted emergency declarations in at least two states and sparked new warnings and travel restrictions.          Washington outbreak: One of the deaths was among four new cases confirmed Sunday -- all residents of a long-term nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington, where officials have been investigating a possible outbreak of coronavirus.          More than 50 residents and staff from the Life Care Center are experiencing symptoms, and will be tested for coronavirus, said Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County. The facility has about 108 residents and 180 staff members.          The investigation was sparked after two people linked to the facility -- a resident and a health care worker -- both tested positive for the coronavirus, Duchin said.\n",

      "Fatality rates for covid-19 could vary enormously\n",
      "A of deaths among people infected by the new coronavirus mounts, it is tempting to divide that figure by the number of reported cases and conclude that the result is the fatality rate. Apply such maths to the world’s total of confirmed cases and deaths on March 11th and you get a fatality rate of 3.6%. But this figure, which epidemiologists call the “naive” case fatality rate, may be wrong in two different ways. First, many of the infections detected at this early stage of the epidemic are recent, so some will eventually result in deaths. That will push the fatality rate up. Second, many infections have not been spotted because testing for the virus has been patchy. Lots of mild cases of the disease have gone unnoticed. If all infections were actually counted, the result would be a bigger denominator. That would push the fatality rate down. As China began to trace infections more carefully, its fatality rate fell (see chart 1).          A conclusive measure of the denominator requires testing for antibodies against the virus in a large sample of people in a place which an outbreak has already swept through. Such studies are under way in China. In the meantime, researchers have estimated the fatality rate for covid-19 using a cohort of people for whom there is a full count of infections and deaths: passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. A bungled quarantine on board led to nearly 700 cases of covid-19. Eight people have died so far. A working paper published on March 5th by Timothy Russell at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and an international team of researchers estimates that the fatality rate among infected passengers will end up being 1.2%.          The researchers applied the results from the ship to data on covid-19 cases and deaths in China. They conclude that the fatality rate for covid-19 in the country’s outbreak was 0.5%. For comparison, that is five times the fatality rate for the seasonal flu in America.          The covid-19 fatality rate among those on the Diamond Princess was higher partly because their average age was 58, older than the general population in any country. At the same time, they are probably in fairly good shape. They must be healthy enough to embark on an extended holiday. People who go on cruises tend to be richer. So the fatality rate among these passengers may be lower than it would be among people of a similar age in their home countries.          A recent study by researchers at the University of Bern, in Switzerland, sheds more light. It provides estimates of covid-19 fatality by age group in Hubei, the province in China with the worst outbreak of the disease (see chart 2). Fatality is dramatically higher among people older than 60, rising to 18% among those in their 80s or older.          But covid-19 may prove no less devastating for poor countries, which tend to have younger populations. The disease is more severe in people whose immune systems are weakened by chronic diseases, so those who are malnourished or have / will probably be hit hard.          The fatality rate in any country will depend primarily on the quality of care it can provide—and how many people have access to it. About 5% of people diagnosed with covid-19 in China have needed intensive care, which is in short supply or non-existent in most hospitals in developing countries. A surge in cases even in rich countries can soon overwhelm hospitals and result in higher fatality rates. ■\n",

      "Coronavirus Death Toll in Seven Hard-Hit States Could Be 50% Higher Than Official Figures Suggest\n",
      "The coronavirus death toll worldwide is thought to be far higher than official records suggest, and now reports that total deaths in seven U.S. states hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic are up nearly 50 percent from the usual figures. The analysis of the seven states—Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and New Jersey—shows 9,000 more excess deaths over and above the 18,000 already attributed to COVID-19. Increasingly, analysts around the world are using the difference between total deaths from all causes during the pandemic and total death from all causes in normal times, saying this figure paints a clearer picture of the true impact of the pandemic, as it also captures deaths caused by knock-on effects of the virus, such as stresses on the health-care system or, on the flip side, reduced road traffic accidents. “It gives you an overall sense of how big things are,” said Samuel Clark, a professor of sociology at Ohio State University whose work is in demography and epidemiology, of the total excess-deaths figure. “For now, you can basically attribute the excess mortality to COVID-19. But you also grab all the things that are not COVID at all, but are probably created by the situation.”\n",

      "Coronavirus updates: Pediatric cases up 90% from last month, report finds\n",
      "A pandemic of the novel coronavirus has now killed more than 732,000 people worldwide.          Over 19.9 million people across the globe have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The actual numbers are believed to be much higher due to testing shortages, many unreported cases and suspicions that some national governments are hiding or downplaying the scope of their outbreaks.          Since the first cases were detected in China in December, the United States has become the worst-affected country, with more than 5 million diagnosed cases and at least 163,282 deaths.          Here's how the news is developing today. All times Eastern. Please refresh this page for updates.          7:46 p.m.: Pediatric cases up 90% from last month, report says          There were nearly 180,000 new COVID-19 cases in children over the last month, according to a weekly report from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association.          The latest report found that between July 9 and Aug. 6, there were 179,990 new child cases -- an increase of 90% over the previous month.          There have been 380,174 child COVID-19 cases reported so far, representing 9.1% of all cases, the survey found.          The report compiles state-by-state data on COVID-19 cases in children. Most cases in children are less severe and do not require hospitalization, the AAP noted.          In the 20 states plus New York City that reported hospitalizations, children were 0.5%-5.3% of total reported hospitalizations, according to the latest report. In the 44 states and New York City reporting mortality data, children were 0%-0.4% of all COVID-19 deaths.          The number of hospitalizations and ICU patients in hard-hit California have been trending down for weeks, Gov. Gavin Newsom said.          Hospitalizations fell by 19.6% and ICU admissions fell by 15.4% in the last two weeks, according to the California Department of Public Health.          California has more coronavirus cases than any other state in the U.S., with over 561,900 people diagnosed.          At least 10,359 people in California have died, according to state data.          3:40 p.m.: Royal Caribbean says testing 'very likely'          It's \"very likely\" that COVID-19 testing will be part of Royal Caribbean's new safety plan when operations resume, cruise line executives said during a second quarter earnings call. No final decision has been made, they added.          The executives said they've been \"humbled and surprised\" by the amount of bookings made for 2021, calling the demand \"remarkable.\"          \"The tone of our bookings, especially as we get into the second half of 2021 has been encouraging,\" CEO Richard Fain said. \"Our guests want to come back. Families want and need to vacation.\"          The CDC's no-sail order is set to expire at the end of September, but it may be extended. Major cruise lines have voluntarily suspended operations in the U.S. until the end of October.          \"We will not rush to return to service until we are confident that we have figured out the changes that we must make,\" Fain said.          Royal Caribbean expects to submit a return-to-sailing plan to the CDC by the end of the month.          The Philadelphia Public League is suspending all interscholastic sport competitions until 2021 following a recommendation from Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, ABC Philadelphia station WPVI reported.          Wolf said Thursday, \"We ought to do everything we can to defeat that virus ... the guidance from us, recommendation, is that we don't do any sports until January first.\"          The Philadelphia Public League said, according to WPVI, \"If guidelines released by the Governor's office change, or are updated in a way that would allow programming to resume, we reserve the right to revisit our decision and provide further guidance on a safe return to play.\"          12:40 p.m.: COVID-19 is not demonstrating a seasonal pattern, WHO says          COVID-19 \"has demonstrated no seasonal pattern\" so far, World Health Organization (WHO) emergencies chief Dr. Mike Ryan said Monday.          \"What it has clearly demonstrated is: you take the pressure off the virus, the virus bounces back,\" Ryan warned.          \"You can call that a second wave, you can call that a second spike, you can call it a flare-up, you can call it anything you like,\" he said. \"Take the pressure off the virus, the virus will bounce back. And that's what we would say to countries in Europe: keep the pressure on the virus.\"          Many countries in Europe -- like France, Germany, Spain and Italy -- had major outbreaks but when they took action they were able to suppress it, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.          \"We all want to see schools safely reopened but we also need to ensure that students, staff and faculty are safe. The foundation for this is adequate control of transmission at the community,\" Tedros said. \"My message is crystal clear: suppress, suppress, suppress the virus. If we suppress the virus effectively, we can safely open up societies.\"          12:15 p.m.: DC adds 5 new states to its quarantine list          Washington, D.C. has added Alaska, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Minnesota to the district's quarantine list.          Those traveling to D.C. from these high-risk states must quarantine for two weeks: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin.          States are added to the list if their seven-day moving average of daily cases is 10 or more per 100,000 people.          Traveling to and from D.C.'s neighboring states, Maryland and Virginia, will not apply to the list.          11 a.m.: 20% of Florida's ICU beds available          In hard-hit Florida, 20.79% of the state's ICU beds were available as of Monday morning, the state's Agency for Healthcare Administration reported.          Thirty-eight hospitals had no available ICU beds Monday while 22 hospitals in the state had just one available bed, the agency said.          These numbers are expected to fluctuate throughout the day as hospitals and medical centers provide updates.          Florida has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. behind California.          Florida has over 536,900 diagnosed cases and at least 8,406 fatalities, according to the state's Department of Health.          9:40 a.m.: TSA screens over 800K people for 1st time since March          The TSA screened 831,789 people on Sunday, marking the first time over 800,000 people traveled in one day since March 17.          This is still down about 70% compared to the same day last year when the TSA screened 2,647,897 travelers.          Major U.S. airlines don't expect recovery to be linear as infection rates and state quarantine rules change over time in different parts of the country.          9:10 a.m.: Cases rising in Lebanon after explosion          Coronavirus cases are rising in Lebanon after the explosion in Beirut last week that killed at least 160 people.          Lebanon reported 294 new cases on Sunday, according to Health Ministry data. Seven days earlier, the daily number of new cases was 155, according to the data.          Lebanon now has a total of 6,517 diagnosed cases and at least 76 COVID-19 fatalities.          8:35 a.m.: Clorox says demand for its wipes is up 500%          Clorox says demand for its wipes is up 500% during the pandemic.          \"We are making wipes in record numbers and shipping them to stores in record numbers,\" Clorox CEO Linda Rendle told \"Good Morning America\" on Monday.          Since January, Clorox has made 100 million more disinfecting products than before -- a 50% increase, Rendle said.          Clorox is now making nearly 1 million packages of disinfectant wipes every day, Rendle said.          7:25 a.m.: UK has 'moral duty' to fully reopen schools next month, PM says          U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson reiterated Monday that he's \"very keen\" for all schools to fully reopen in England next month.          \"It’s not right that kids should spend more time out of school,\" Johnson told reporters while visiting a school in East London. \"It’s much, much better for their health and mental wellbeing, obviously their educational prospects, if everybody comes back to school full-time in September.\"          \"It's our moral duty as a country to make sure that happens,\" he added.          Johnson said he's been \"impressed\" by the work administrators and teachers have done to make sure schools are safe.          Last month, the U.K. government outlined a plan for the \"mandatory\" return to classrooms across England in September, with students being restricted to \"class or year sized bubbles\" and teachers being told to \"address gaps in knowledge.\"          Schools across the United Kingdom shuttered in mid-March at the start of the pandemic. Some pupils returned to classrooms in England in June.          Meanwhile, Scotland is set to fully reopen its schools on Tuesday.          6:49 a.m.: India's former president tests positive for COVID-19          India's former president, Pranab Mukherjee, has tested positive for COVID-19.          \"On a visit to the hospital for a separate procedure, I have tested positive for Covid-19 today,\" Mukherjee, who served as president of India from 2012 to 2017, announced via Twitter on Monday. \"I request the people who came in contact with me in the last week, to please self isolate and get tested for Covid-19.\"          With more than 2.2 million diagnosed cases of COVID-19, India has the third-highest tally in the world, behind the U.S. and Brazil.          A coronavirus testing site will open soon near the U.S.-Mexico border in Southern California's San Diego County, according to a report by San Diego ABC affiliate KGTV.          The appointment-free, walk-up testing site will be located at the San Ysidro Port of Entry’s PedWest crossing, one of the world's busiest pedestrian international border crossings. The site, among more than two dozen others across San Diego County, will be the closest one to the border with Mexico so far for the region.          The United States and Mexico are two of the worst-affected nations in the coronavirus pandemic.          The Hispanic community makes up just 34% of San Diego's population and yet, as of Sunday, they accounted for 62% of the city's COVID-19 cases, according to KGTV. That figure will likely rise after the new testing site opens up within the next couple weeks, since the area is dominated by Spanish speakers.          However, Chicano Federation Chief Strategy Officer Roberto Alcantar said many in the Latino community are still afraid of getting tested.          \"Our community is nervous about losing their jobs, not being able to go to work, the real economic impact that comes from being positive and feeling that that might hinder them in a way,\" Alcantar told KGTV.          An additional 19 coronavirus-related deaths were recorded in the Australian state of Victoria on Sunday -- the highest single-day increase in fatalities that the country has seen since the start of the pandemic,          \"This news is devastating no matter what age COVID affects people, and we just want to reaffirm again our support through every channel we can provide it,\" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra on Monday.          Victoria’s Department of Health and Human Services also reported 322 new cases of COVID-19 -- the lowest daily count recorded in the state since July 29.          \"We are seeing some stability. That's a good thing. But that's not enough,\" Victoria's state Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in Melbourne. \"And that's the product of masks and Stage 3. That's what the experts tell us. The next stage, though, is all about these restrictions that we've had to painfully impose.\"          Andrews declared a state of disaster in Victoria on Aug. 2, giving authorities additional powers to ensure people are complying with public health directions. Victoria is home to Australia's second-largest city, Melbourne, which has become a hotspot in the country's novel coronavirus outbreak.          In total, Australia has reported more than 21,000 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 with at least 313 deaths.          3:45 a.m.: US records under 50,000 new cases for 1st time in 6 days          There were 46,395 new cases of COVID-19 identified in the United States on Sunday, bringing the nationwide total soaring past 5 million, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.          It's the first time in six days that the nation has recorded under 50,000 new cases. An additional 516 coronavirus-related deaths were also reported.          Sunday's caseload is well below the record set on July 16, when more than 77,000 new cases were identified in a 24-hour reporting period.          A total of 5,045,564 people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with COVID-19 since the pandemic began, and at least 162,938 of them have died, according to Johns Hopkins. The cases include people from all 50 U.S. states, Washington, D.C. and other U.S. territories as well as repatriated citizens.          By May 20, all U.S. states had begun lifting stay-at-home orders and other restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The day-to-day increase in the country's cases then hovered around 20,000 for a couple of weeks before shooting back up and crossing 70,000 for the first time in mid-July.          Many states have seen a rise in infections in recent weeks, with some -- including Arizona, California and Florida -- reporting daily records. However, new data published last week in an internal memo from the Federal Emergency Management Agency suggests that the national surge in cases could be leveling off.

      "FBI Discovers Homegrown Islamic Terror Compound In Alabama\n",
      "The FBI has uncovered a homegrown, jihadist compound in Macon County, Alabama.          The FBI‘s search warrant described the property as a “makeshift military-style obstacle course” in a story first reported by Sinclair Broadcast Group. The land where the group gathered reportedly looked like an “abandoned dump,” and was led by Siraj Wahhaj, who allegedly trained children to commit school shootings in a similar terrorist breeding ground in New Mexico last year. (RELATED: After Dropped Charges, FBI Re-Arrests Five ‘Extremist Muslim’ New Mexico Compound Suspects)          Wahhaj and four other alleged Islamic extremists were indicted on terrorism, kidnapping, and firearm violation charges earlier this year. (RELATED: Convicted Islamic Terrorist Vallmoe Shqaire Held US Citizenship, Lived In Country For Years)                     In an interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group, former FBI agent Tim Fuhrman warned of the increasing threats of domestic terror that “exists in every region of the United States and affects all walks of life.”          “Just because you’re in a small town or a small state does not mean you might not potentially have individuals engaged in the types of activities that would call into question threats to national security,” Fuhrman said.          The FBI is currently involved in 850 domestic terrorism investigations, Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Michael McGarrity said earlier this week while speaking to the House Homeland Security Committee, according to CNN.          “The FBI assesses domestic terrorists collectively pose a persistent and evolving threat of violence and economic harm to the United States,” McGarrity said.\n",

      "GOP congressman say IG report will be 'indictment' of Adam Schiff\n",
      "A Republican congressman has predicted the soon-to-be-released inspector general's report on the origins of the investigation into Donald Trump's presidential campaign will reveal serious misconduct.          Rep. John Ratcliffe from Texas, who has been briefed on Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report, said it will likely be released in early December and expose Justice Department wrongdoing.          'We know this - the report is supposedly 500 pages. It doesn't take an inspector general 500 pages to say that everything was done correctly and properly,' Ratcliffe said during an interview on Fox News on Sunday. 'The IG report is going to find that there were problems.'          Horowitz is probing whether proper procedure was followed in obtaining a FISA warrant to surveil Trump campaign advisor Carter Page, and how British ex-spy Christopher Steele's 'dirty dossier' became key FBI evidence.          Ratcliffe said that Democrats fear that the report will come out before they complete their impeachment inquiry, which is being led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.          'I think it's going to be an indictment of Adam Schiff, who has written his own FISA rebuttal memo in 2018 saying how dare Republicans criticize people like Peter Strozk, Lisa Page and Andy McCabe, and Bruce Ohr, who have done nothing wrong,' Ratcliffe said.          Strozk and Page, key figures in the Trump-Russia investigation, were ousted from the FBI after text messages revealed their secret love affair and anti-Trump sentiments.          McCabe, who signed some of the Carter Page FISA warrants, was fired as FBI deputy director after an internal investigation found he lied about feeding information to the media.          Ohr, who was Steele's pipeline for feeding information to the FBI and DOJ, remains employed by the Justice Department.          'The Democrats are racing to get through this impeachment as quickly as possible,' Ratcliffe said in the interview.          'They know that the inspector general's report is likely to be damning about the origins of the 2016 investigation into the Trump campaign, the role that the Obama-Biden administration officials played in that,' he said.          The IG report is currently undergoing a final review ahead of its public release.          Horowitz told Congress in a letter last month that he did not expect a lengthy review period and that he intended to make as much of the report public as possible, with minimal redactions.          The inspector general provided a draft copy to Attorney General William Barr in September, and the Justice Department has since been conducting a classification review.          Horowitz's team has reviewed over one million records and conducted more than 100 interviews, including several who were interviewed in the last few months, the inspector general has told Congress.          The investigation is one of several inquiries into the origins of the FBI's investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.          Barr, meanwhile, has appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to conduct a separate investigation that has since turned into a criminal matter, according to a person familiar with the situation. It's unclear what potential crime is being looked at.          Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, has previously led investigations into the FBI's cozy relationship with Boston mobsters such as James 'Whitey' Bulger and the CIA's use of tough interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects.          The Justice Department has said Trump recently made several calls at Barr's request to foreign leaders, including Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, to help the attorney general with the current Durham probe of the investigation.          Barr also traveled with Durham to Italy in August and September, and the two met with Italian intelligence officials to seek information about the activities of FBI agents assigned there, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte has said.          It was in Italy that George Papadopoulos, who served as a foreign policy adviser to Trump's campaign, was told by a mysterious Maltese professor, Joseph Mifsud, that Russia had 'dirt' on Clinton in the form of the stolen emails.          The FBI says it opened its probe into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia after Papadopoulos gabbed to Australian diplomats about what he'd heard about the stolen emails.          Papadopoulos later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Mifsud.          In his interview, Ratcliffe said that investigators withheld exculpatory information about Papadopolous from the courts.          There are reports that Papadopolous was approached by an informant wearing a wire, who tried to entice him into a criminal conspiracy involving Russia, but was rebuffed by Papadopolous.          Mifsud's whereabouts have remained a mystery, but four days ago an audio recording purporting to be his voice was sent in an encrypted file to the Italian publication Adnkronos.          'First of all I would like to say that I have absolutely no contact with friends and family and that I have not had contact with friends and family for several months,' the voice on the recording says.          'It has been almost two years now that the whole matter has exploded and been presented to the world media and on the world stage as if I had something to do with matters concerning countries or had I tried to infiltrate it, it is absolutely absurd,' says the voice.\n",

      "Kat Timpf: Michael Flynn case isn't about politics – this is what should concern all Americans\n",
      "Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.          Ever since Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn’s lawyers released documents revealing that the FBI had openly considered whether or not their “goal” in interviewing Flynn was to “get him to lie” so they could “prosecute him or get him fired,” the response has been largely divided along partisan lines.          Here’s the thing: I reject the idea that Flynn, President Trump's first national security adviser, did nothing wrong. At the same time, I also reject the idea that, because Flynn did something wrong, I must also be OK with how the FBI approached this interview. And I will never understand how anyone is using “But this happens all the time!” in defense of the FBI. The prevalence of such a process doesn’t make me feel better; it makes me feel worse. I’d love to see more Americans standing up for our rights – universally, and without any partisan spin.          SOL WISENBERG: MICHAEL FLYNN CASE — HOW FBI OFFICIALS, STEP BY STEP, ABUSED THEIR POWER          Unfortunately, I haven’t seen our discourse making room for much nuanced thinking. Ever since those controversial handwritten notes – which Fox News reports were penned by former FBI head of counterintelligence Bill Priestap after a meeting with then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and then-FBI Director James Comey – became public last week, most of the responses have been predictably partisan, with each side sticking to whatever set of talking points make their side look better.          The Republican response, for example, has been pretty much in line with that of the president, who said the revelations amount to an “exoneration” of Flynn.          “He's in the process of being exonerated. If you look at those notes from yesterday, that was total exoneration,” Trump said on Thursday. “These were dirty, filthy cops at the top of the FBI.”          “He is essentially exonerated,” Trump continued. “Now, that’s not official yet, but when you read the notes, how can you do anything else?”          Trump’s base, of course, sees the news as a welcome confirmation of what they’ve been saying all along – the Russia investigation was little more than a partisan hack job, and Flynn one of its victims – and they’re singing it from the rooftops.          The liberal side, of course, has a much different take on the story. Many have been quick to point out that none of the recent news changes the fact that Flynn admitted to lying. Others have argued that examining the full context of those FBI meeting notes and learning more about law enforcement practices in general effectively melts the controversy away.          In The Washington Post, Aaron Blake argues that “the documents make clear … that the FBI believed it had strong evidence against Flynn going into the interview… so strong that either Flynn would admit to his wrongdoing or be forced to lie about it,” and that it is “not a terribly unusual approach to such situations when you have strong evidence.”          This duality has been incredibly frustrating, and I doubt I'm the only one who feels this way. I don’t think the recent news “exonerates” Flynn. He admitted to lying, after all, and the lying had apparently started before the interview in question had even occurred. We should all acknowledge that – but it shouldn’t stop us from also acknowledging that the FBI’s treatment of him was outrageous.          There are many excellent arguments to be made about politics playing a role in the Russia investigation, but more than a year after its conclusion, I’m far less interested in any debate about those particulars than I am in expressing my outrage over a system in which these sorts of law enforcement practices are acceptable.          Government investigators should investigate crimes. They should not blatantly discuss potentially using an interview to create a crime. That kind of behavior should infuriate every American, regardless of the political implications of a particular case.          CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER          Too often, people get so wrapped up in partisan politics that larger points get lost. This is one of those times. It's OK to argue over politics (that's healthy and inevitable), but we must make sure those political passions don’t blind us from seeing what's at stake – in this case it's the abuse of power by law enforcement officials.          The Flynn interview notes tell us that something in the system has to change. Not for the sake of Republicans and not for the sake of Democrats, but for the sake of protecting the inalienable rights of all Americans.          CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n",

      "Republicans Focus on Joseph Mifsud as Key to Investigation's Origins\n",
      "Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee repeatedly asked Special Counsel Robert Mueller why he never indicted Joseph Mifsud, who was key to the Russia collusion narrative.          They appear to believe that Mifsud was possibly used by opponents of then-candidate Donald Trump to implicate his campaign in wrongdoing, and provide the basis for later surveillance and investigation (as well as, though they did not succeed, prosecution and impeachment).          Mifsud was key to the prosecution of junior Trump campaign foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos, who admitted that he lied to the FBI about meeting Mifsud before joining the campaign. (They had met afterwards.)          Their [the media] story reportedly was that a Maltese professor named Joseph Mifsud told Papadopoulos the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails, and Papadopoulos passed that on during a meeting at a bar with Australian diplomat Alexander Downer in London, prompting Downer to tell U.S. officials, and prompting the FBI investigation. However, Mifsud’s lawyer would later tell CNN and other outlets that the professor was never a Russian agent, but instead working on behalf of Western intelligence.          A report in October from the Associated Press described Mifsud as having a “bizarre academic career punctuated by scandals and disappearing acts.” Some have rumored that Mifsud has died, but his Swiss-German lawyer, Stephan Roh, told the AP that Mifsud is still alive. Mifsud faced scandals in the early 2000s while working at the University of Malta, where he was accused of “financial mismanagement.” He then disappeared in 2007 and began to work at the Euro-Mediterranean University in Slovenia. He reportedly left the university with close to the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars in debt, before vanishing once again. Mifsud then began working at the London Academy of Diplomacy in 2013. It was is in London that Mifsud met Trump’s advisor Papadopolous to discuss the Russia emails.          The Mueller report itself says:          Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos made early contact with Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who had connections to Russia and traveled to Moscow in April 2016. Immediately upon his return to London from that trip, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that the Russian government had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails. One week later, in the first week of May 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to candidate Clinton. Throughout that period of time and for several months thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government. No meeting took place.          The report adds that Papadopoulos’s false statements about his meeting with Mifsud “hindered investigators’ ability to effectively question Mifsud when he was interviewed in the lobby of a Washington, D.C. hotel on February 10, 2017.”          It goes on to say that Mifsud himself made false statements to FBI investigators, denying the extent of his contacts with Papadopoulos, and denying “that he had advance knowledge that Russia was in possession of emails damaging to candidate Clinton, stating that he and Papadopoulos had discussed cybersecurity and hacking as a larger issue and that Papadopoulos must have misunderstood their conversation.”          Republicans asked Mueller several times why Mifsud had not been prosecuted for making false statements to the FBI, when others — including Papadopoulos, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort — had been.          Mueller declined to comment on that. However, given previous reports that the FBI used at least one source to infiltrate the Trump campaign, Republicans seemed to be implying that Mifsud had been spared prosecution for a reason.          Ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes (R-CA) said in May that he believed Mifsud had ties to the U.S. State Department. As the Washington Examiner noted at the time, Nunes sent a letter to the Special Counsel detailing Mifsud’s ties to Western agencies, and included a photograph with Mifsud and British politician Boris Johnson — who became prime minister Wednesday, and who was mentioned at the hearing.          In the letter, Nunez raised the possibility that Mifsud was an intelligence risk to the U.S. and its allies, if he was indeed a Russian operative, as the Special Counsel’s report suggested. Alternatively, Nunes said, the FBI had been using Mifsud as an informant, which would explain why it knew to ask Papadopoulos about Clinton’s emails.          Attorney General William Barr is currently conducting an investigation into the origins of the investigation of the Trump campaign. Republicans are flagging Mifsud as someone Barr needs to understand in the course of that inquiry.\n",

      "Break the Ice: Trump ramping up US presence in the Arctic as Russia, China threats loom\n",
      "President Trump, in a recent memo, asked executive departments to report back by early August on how they can develop a U.S. \"fleet\" of icebreaking ships to navigate the frozen Arctic and Antarctic -- marking yet another step in the administration's efforts to strengthen U.S. influence in the region as it faces challenges from Russia and China.          Specifically, the Trump memo ordered the State Department, Defense Department, Commerce Department and Office of Management and Budget to review how the U.S. could acquire \"at least three heavy polar-class security cutters,\" better known as icebreakers.          The U.S. currently lags behind Russia in the icebreakers department, and sees this deficit as a problem. Energy resources, security concerns and more are driving the push to catch up.          The memo, which also considered using smaller icebreakers to support national security priorities like \"unmanned aviation\" and \"space systems,\" even flicked at the possibility of a more militarized presence: \"This assessment shall also evaluate defensive armament adequate to defend against threats by near-peer competitors and the potential for nuclear-powered propulsion.\"          STATE DEPARTMENT APPOINTS SPECIAL ENVOY TO ARCTIC AMID CONCERNS OVER RUSSIAN, CHINESE INFLUENCE THERE          Below is a look at three major areas where the U.S. faces challenges in the Arctic, and what the Trump administration has done about them.          Icebreakers: The terminology in the memo speaking of a \"fleet\" of icebreakers is perhaps a bit misleading -- the U.S. currently only has one heavy icebreaker that is used for missions in both the Arctic and Antarctic. That icebreaker, the USCG Polar Star, is more than 40 years old. In addition, the Coast Guard maintains the medium icebreaker, the USCG Healy. Other icebreakers in the U.S. are privately owned.          Russia, meanwhile, has dozens of icebreakers, including several that are nuclear powered, multiple large icebreakers and what can legitimately be called a fleet of medium icebreakers. China has a handful of medium icebreakers and is angling for new ones as well.          \"We really don't have the ability to project the presence we need to project in both the Arctic and the Antarctic,\" Vice Adm. Scott Buschman, the Coast Guard's deputy commandant for operations, told Fox News of U.S. capabilities with just the Polar Star and the Healy. Buschman's rank is the equivalent of a three-star general.          \"We do need additional polar icebreakers to do what we need to do both in the Antarctic and the Arctic at the high latitudes. In the past they used the term... 'six, three, one.' We need six icebreakers, at least three of which are heavy icebreakers. And we need one now.\"          Nick Solheim, the founder of the Wallace Institute for Arctic Security, told Fox News that although the U.S. has little Arctic territory compared with Russia, and therefore it makes sense why Russia would have more icebreakers, America's capabilities are woefully insufficient.          PENTAGON PREPARING TO OPEN SCHOOLS ON MILITARY BASES WORLDWIDE THIS FALL          \"There was an instance a couple of years back where an Alaskan city contracted a Russian icebreaker to deliver fuel and supplies so the city could continue running through the winter,\" he said. \"Because we were not able to get there. That's alarming when you have to, as a city in the United States, as an American citizen with the same rights as every other American citizen, have to... charge a foreign country with supplying your own city. That's absolutely insane.\"          The Anchorage Daily News reported in 2011 that a Russian icebreaker named the Renada was contracted to deliver fuel to Nome, Alaska, as the Polar Star was undergoing repairs in its homeport of Seattle and the Healy, which was near Nome at the time, was unable to break through the thick ice separating land from sea.          Buschman warned that the U.S. needs to keep pace with its rivals in order to maintain all its responsibilities and guard its interests in the Arctic.          \"There is a lot more interest by countries in the Arctic. Certainly by Russia. Certainly by China. They're also increasing their ability to build out their fleet and operate in the Arctic,\" he said. \"At the current pace, China's got the potential to have more icebreaking capacity than the United States by 2025.\"          Diplomacy: It's not just in numbers of ships that China is attempting to overtake the United States, with regard to the Arctic. China, in the model of its Belt and Road Initiative, is attempting to set up a \"Polar Silk Road.\" With climate change making shipping lanes through the Arctic more plausible, China sees an opportunity to dominate what is likely to be a stepped-up level of Arctic commerce by establishing diplomatic and economic relationships with Arctic countries.          Solheim notes China's increased activity on the Arctic Council, an international organization of Arctic countries, which China is not technically a member of, and its efforts to court individual members of the council as well. China in the last decade, for example, signed a free trade agreement with Iceland. It's also tried to use its Confucious Institutes -- Chinese government-programs that exist in American universities as well -- to spread propaganda in Arctic countries.          China also tried to build airports in the Danish territory of Greenland before the U.S. put the brakes on that enterprise, and in May gained majority control of a Norwegian airline through several degrees of corporations owning other corporations.          GORDON CHANG: US-CHINA RELATIONS -- 4 REASONS TO SCALE BACK DIPLOMATIC FACILITIES IN BOTH COUNTRIES          \"We're all familiar with the way that China instituted debt trapping scams in Africa. They'll come in and they'll say, 'Hey, we'll build you this port at this really high interest rate, and if you don't pay, it's ours.' And then that exact sequence happens. So now China owns your port,\" Solheim said.          \"It's different in the way that it works in the Arctic because these are not poor countries with very high debt-to-GDP ratios,\" he continued. \"These are real developed countries. And so what China is attempting to do instead is be diplomatic, which is not really good at it, but it's trying to do it anyway.\"          And when diplomacy or subtle propaganda doesn't work, China has resorted to threats.          On Swedish public radio in November, according to The Economist, Chinese Ambassador to Sweden Gui Congyou said, \"We treat our friends with fine wine, but for our enemies we have shotguns.\" Sweden, according to Radio Free Asia, had closed all the Confucius Institutes in its country by April, as its relationship with China continued to deteriorate.          And when the Faroe Islands were considering whether or not to use the Chinese-controlled tech company Huawei for their 5G infrastructure, the Chinese ambassador to Denmark, which controls the Faroe Islands, threatened to tank a trade deal between China and the Faroe Islands if Huawei was not given the job, according to the Danish newspaper Berlingske.          The U.S. has taken concrete steps to reinforce its relations with other Arctic nations as recently as last month, specifically with Denmark. The day after Trump issued his memorandum, it opened a consulate in Greenland, the icy Arctic territory of Denmark and the largest island in the world.          \"I am proud to celebrate the reopening of the United States Consulate in Nuuk, Greenland, on June 10, 2020, reflecting America’s commitment to deepening our cooperation with the people of Greenland and the entire Kingdom of Denmark,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a June statement. \"Our presence in Nuuk will enhance the prosperity we share with our friends in Denmark and Greenland, as we work together with other Arctic allies and partners to ensure the stability and sustainability of development in the region.\"          And Wednesday, the State Department appointed career diplomat Jim DeHart to fill the position of U.S. Coordinator for the Arctic Region, a slot that had been created under the Obama administration but was open for the past three years after its previous occupant stepped down following Trump's election.          Buschman said that for the U.S. to successfully accomplish its goals in the Arctic there needs to be a \"nuanced response to complex issues,\" including cooperation between the Defense Department and State Department.          \"Strong partnerships are really a key component of our Arctic strategy,\" Buschman said. \"We recognize that success in the Arctic requires a very collective effort across public sectors, across private sectors and includes international partnerships... Competition does not need to necessarily lead to conflict.\"          Solheim also emphasized the need for engagement with Arctic allies.          \"You get a lot of experts in the United States that want to say 'If we fund this polar security cutter program, America will be safe and secure and that will be it. I vehemently disagree with that,\" he said. \"We need to be collaborating with our allies and our partners and even international organizations like the Arctic Council to ensure that we are working together and collaborating on keeping the Arctic a free and safe place for everyone who lives there.\"          Infrastructure: Also addressed in the president's memo was a request for \"at least two optimal United States basing locations and at least two international basing locations.\"          A new \"basing location\" in Alaska, for example, could help the Coast Guard more efficiently carry out its duties without having to steam its ships up and down the West Coast from their homeport in Seattle          \"The main problem is, and the president brings this up in this memorandum, that we don't port our polar security cutters in Alaska or the Arctic. We port them very far away from where they're actually needed,\" Solheim said. \"And the fact we don't have bases that we can port polar security cutters at for long periods of time there or do repairs on is insane.\"          Solheim also mentions that the international basing locations could include \"a cooperative base with an allied country\" and that there's been an effort to build, for commerce, a deepwater port in Nome, Alaska, which could prove helpful to the Coast Guard.          Buschman mentioned that the Coast Guard also has plenty of real estate in Alaska, and said there is no \"specific requirement for a deepwater port\" -- just the ships -- but he said that if a deepwater port was built in Alaska, the Coast Guard could take advantage of it.          CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP          The vice admiral emphasized that Americans should care about what happens in the Arctic, even though it might seem like a far-off region.          \"From a resource standpoint, 13 percent of the world's undiscovered conventional oil resources are projected to be in the Arctic, 30 percent of undiscovered natural gas, about a trillion dollars in minerals,\" he said, also emphasizing that the Bering Sea fishery is about 50 percent of the United States' fishing resources, by volume.          He added: \"Certainly China and Russia are much more interested in the Arctic... the United States is a leader in the Arctic region. The Coast Guard is a leader, as part of the overall U.S. effort. And I think that if the United States doesn't continue to show leadership someone else will.\"\n",

      "Trust deficit: The roots of Russia’s standoff with the West\n",
      "“When you wonder why Putin often opposes the West, and Russians tend to support him, you need to see that side of it,” says Yevgeny Bazhanov, a retired professor.          Western examples also soured Russian perspectives. The 1999 war over Kosovo illustrated to Russians that NATO was not simply a defensive alliance. The 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and subsequent Middle East misadventures created the impression that the U.S. was an aggressor that didn’t know what it was doing. The 2008 financial crash tarnished the U.S. economic model.          Defanging the hostility in part requires understanding what Russians see as historic wrongs inflicted by the West. Western leaders gave Mikhail Gorbachev assurances NATO would not be expanded into the former Soviet sphere, but following the USSR’s demise, U.S. President Bill Clinton took office and adopted other plans.          It’s difficult to hold a conversation with any Russian foreign policy specialist today without getting dragged into arguments with the underlying assumption that the other side – be it Russia or the West – must change its behavior. But most agree that, in a world facing common challenges including a relentless coronavirus pandemic, the replay of the Cold War is a serious obstacle to international efforts to stave off global disaster.          It was Dec. 25, 1991, when the USSR abruptly ceased to exist.          Just before midnight, the Soviet red hammer-and-sickle banner was pulled down from the Kremlin for the last time, and up fluttered an unfamiliar white-blue-red tricolor that proclaimed the birth – or rebirth – of Russia.          It was truly an inflection point. The Soviet Union, the communist behemoth that had defined one pole of a binary world order for decades, had simply evaporated. It had already abandoned its Eastern European empire and dissolved its military alliance. Now its rivalry with the United States, complete with a hostile anti-capitalist ideology, a costly nuclear arms race, and multiple proxy wars around the world, was gone.          Commentators hailed this not merely as an end to a divided world with its permanent threat of nuclear war, but as a chance to create an inclusive, ideology-free order that might improve the lot of all humankind.          It was a world that seemed within reach thanks to the discovery, as the walls crumbled and the Cold War stereotypes receded, that most Russians were surprisingly, enthusiastically pro-Western. Vladimir Pozner, an American-Russian who grew up in New York, then spent 30 years working in the bowels of the Soviet propaganda machine before becoming a TV personality in both the U.S. and Russia, recalls it as the most exhilarating moment of his life.          “There was this emotional upsurge in the country. People felt like they were coming out of a cocoon after a very long time,” he says. “Many of us thought, finally, we are going to become part of the world – as we always really wanted to be – be accepted, be participants. It was a really enthralling vision.”          Things have, conspicuously, not turned out that way. Tracking polls that showed Russians overwhelmingly pro-American in the 1990s now show majorities of Russians suspicious of the U.S. Even though today’s Russia is a capitalist country, without an empire or an antagonistic ideology, American attitudes toward Russia have turned as negative as they ever were toward the old USSR.          It’s difficult to hold a conversation with any Russian foreign policy specialist today without getting dragged into polemics: angry accusations, defensive responses, and the underlying assumption that the other side must change its behavior before a more constructive global order becomes feasible.          But most agree that, in a world facing common challenges like climate change, the persisting danger of nuclear conflict, and a relentless coronavirus pandemic, the replay of the Cold War is a serious obstacle to international efforts to stave off global disaster. Some even offer a few practical ideas for how Russia and the West might at least formulate some new priorities to minimize confrontation and maximize cooperation.          “I do believe that most of the issues between us can be solved, not by one vanquishing the other, but by finding new terms of mutual acceptance,” says Andrei Klimov, deputy chair of the foreign affairs committee of Russia’s upper house of parliament. “My dream is, maybe during my lifetime, that we will see normal politicians on both sides sit down together with a readiness to formulate pragmatic answers to the questions that vex our relationship.”          From the Russian perspective, the evolution of disillusionment with the West was a natural progression.          Alexei Gromyko, as director of the official Institute of Europe, often serves in an advisory role to today’s Russian leaders. On an overcast afternoon in mid-March, the institute, an ornate 19th-century building near the Kremlin, was empty amid the beginnings of Russia’s coronavirus shutdown. But Mr. Gromyko was in his office, willing to talk about how he sees East-West relations.          In his view, today’s inflamed geopolitical crisis was rooted in the post-Cold War failure to create a security system, primarily in Europe, that would fully include Russia. Western leaders gave Mikhail Gorbachev strong verbal assurances NATO would not be expanded into the former Soviet sphere but, as Mr. Gromyko ruefully notes, Mr. Gorbachev failed to get that in writing. Following the USSR’s demise, U.S. President Bill Clinton took office and adopted other plans. That lesson was not lost on the Russians.          “After the collapse of one pillar of the former bipolar world order, it became fashionable in the West to think that the world order could become unipolar, with the U.S. at the helm,” he says. “In the 1990s, Russia descended into its worst crisis since 1917. It not only ceased to be a superpower, it suffered political, economic, and social collapse as well. It was not even clear that Russia would survive physically. So, perhaps believing that Russian interests and views didn’t matter anymore, Clinton made the decision to enlarge NATO to the east.”          “But just because Russia couldn’t do anything about it at the time doesn’t mean that we accepted it. We never did. Since then the process of NATO expansion has been unstoppable, and so has the subsequent chain of events.”          The Western alliance has since taken in all of the former Soviet Union’s Warsaw Pact allies, as well as the three former Soviet Baltic republics. Mr. Gromyko says the Russians signaled repeatedly to Western counterparts that inducting Ukraine or Georgia into the alliance would be a red line. At its 2008 Bucharest Summit, NATO shelved those countries’ applications, but issued a statement insisting they would eventually join.          A few months later Georgia attacked the Russian-backed statelet of South Ossetia, which belongs to Georgia but had de facto independence since the early ’90s. Russia staged a military intervention and drove Georgian forces back.          In early 2014, after a disorderly change of power in Kyiv brought pro-Western nationalists to power, Russia again intervened, seizing the Crimean Peninsula – where the main base for Russia’s Black Sea naval fleet is located – and orchestrating a referendum in which Crimeans voted to join Russia. Moscow subsequently stirred up, armed, and gave military support to anti-Kyiv separatists in Ukraine’s east.          Mr. Gromyko insists Russia has nothing to apologize for. The idea of Ukraine joining NATO is as unthinkable for Moscow as, say, Mexico joining a Chinese-led military alliance would be for Washington, he suggests.          “It’s not that we view NATO as an existential threat right now,” he says. “But Russia cannot accept that a country next door would be a member of a military alliance that is hostile to Russia,” he says. “We are not opposed to Ukraine being democratic. It’s fine with us if a neighbor has a different political and social system. But not a member of an adversarial bloc. Security is the central issue.”          He says that, at least in Europe, people have concluded that NATO expansion has reached its natural limit. If that can be formalized, he suggests, it might ease the standoff over Ukraine and lead to wider negotiations for a more stable security order in Europe.          But he is not optimistic about relations with the U.S. Only one of the Cold War-era networks of nuclear arms-control agreements remains in force, and it will soon expire. And the U.S. keeps ramping up sanctions.          “Even if we have a breakthrough on Ukraine tomorrow, we are quite sure that U.S. sanctions will not be lifted,” Mr. Gromyko says. “Sanctions have taken on a life of their own, and new ones have no direct connection with the situation between Ukraine and Russia.”          Sanctions have also hastened Russia’s drift into China’s strategic and economic embrace. But the pivot wasn’t just about the Kremlin’s desire to show the West it has alternatives, say Russian experts. “The process of strengthening ties with China has been going on since 1989,” says Mr. Klimov. “That ship sailed well before the current crisis.”          The public’s view of Russia’s standoff with the West is not well covered, and the story gets told in the voices of political leaders. But Russian experts note that Russians’ disenchantment with their system played a role in the USSR’s collapse, while the widespread perception of the West as a superior civilization conditioned the pro-American orientation of Boris Yeltsin’s post-Soviet government.          Yevgeny Bazhanov, now retired, was a longtime professor and for some years the rector of the Diplomatic Academy, which trains Russian diplomats. He recalls watching students over the years morph from admirers of the West into hardened critics. That tendency was informed by the examples they perceived the U.S. setting, he says.          “You can blame Putin, or some kind of Russian stubbornness, but that wasn’t the main thing,” he says. “In the early ’90s we wanted to be a prosperous, democratic country, and the West was the model for our development. But reforms enacted on Western advice produced economic disaster and mass misery. People started to believe that the West didn’t want Russia to succeed. It looked like the U.S. wanted Russia to become a junior partner, like Germany or the U.K. But most Russians wanted to follow an independent policy, to be friends and partners with the West, but to be ourselves.”          He says several events led many Russians to question not only the idea of U.S. leadership, but competence. The 1999 war over Kosovo illustrated to them that NATO was not simply a defensive alliance. The 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and subsequent Middle East misadventures, created the impression the U.S. was an aggressor, and one that didn’t seem to know what it was doing. The 2008 financial crash tarnished the U.S. economic model.          “When you wonder why Putin often opposes the West, and Russians tend to support him, you need to see that side of it,” says Mr. Bazhanov.          “Citizen diplomacy” might be the best antidote to the war of words, says Mr. Pozner. He may be uniquely qualified in that respect. For the past three years he has given lectures at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, in Monterey, California, addressing mainly Russia-studies students, but also holding events with wider audiences. He travels Russia to give public talks, and hosts one of the most popular public affairs shows on state TV.          “Sometimes Americans ask me, how can you live with your government when it does things like poisoning the Skripals, or interfering in our elections? I answer that, like most Russians, I have no idea what Russian secret services are doing, but I am dubious about these accusations,” Mr. Pozner says. “In Russia, people are long accustomed to our authorities blaming the ‘foreign hand’ when things go wrong. It’s convenient because it displaces blame and tars critics with enemy associations. I’m sorry, I just don’t believe that anything Russia did could have swayed an American election. It’s a bit depressing to hear Americans talking like this, as if they were in the Soviet Union, and uncritically believing something their secret services tell them.”          During the 1980s Mr. Pozner took part in “Space Bridge” programs that brought ordinary Americans together with Soviets over a satellite link, and let them converse.          “The whole Cold War mood simply evaporated as they started comparing their lives, their hopes, talking about their families, even emptying their handbags to show each other what kind of stuff they had. The real Cold War disappeared shortly thereafter. I am convinced that if you get people together to dialogue, they may not become friends but they will find terms of coexistence,” he says.          It’s hard to guess at the future. Most Russian experts agree the coronavirus pandemic is an urgent global wake-up call, and fostering international cooperation an existential issue.          But before Russia and the West can establish areas of cooperation, it is probably necessary to address the gaping “trust deficit,” or the urge to see everything the other side does through a dark prism. An example is Russia’s efforts to provide coronavirus assistance to Italy, and the U.S., during the pandemic’s worst days. What might have been greeted as a good deed – albeit with the ulterior motives that usually apply with aid – was almost universally treated in Western media as a propaganda ploy and an attempt to disrupt European unity.          “During the old Cold War, the West was genuinely united and self-confident. They not only claimed to be right, they were fully convinced of it,” says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs, a Moscow-based foreign policy journal. “Today, many Western countries face deep internal discord and uncertainty. There are serious strains within the alliance.          “I believe this urge to disproportionately blame Russia comes from that new place of insecurity and lack of confidence. I doubt there is much we can do to change this atmosphere of acrimony and recrimination until they start to fix their own problems. Amid this crisis we all need to work on that, and Russia too will need to change itself to survive. Maybe after we come through this we can find modes of dialogue.”\n",

      "Russians are still meddling in US elections, Mueller said. Is anybody listening?\n",
      "Washington (CNN) The biggest takeaway from Robert Mueller 's appearances on Capitol Hill is not that Donald Trump may have obstructed justice , although that's what most people continue to argue about.          It's that Russians are still interfering in US elections.          \"They're doing it as we sit here,\" Mueller told lawmakers of Russian interference. Earlier he'd said how that aspect of his investigation has been underplayed will have a long-term effect on the US.          Yet despite Mueller's testimony, the special counsel report and alarming statements from elsewhere in Washington, public urgency on addressing Russian interference for the 2020 election appears lacking.          \"Russians massively intervened in 2016 and they are prepared to do so again in voting that is set to begin a mere eight months from now,\" said House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, pointing out the one thing the Mueller report makes absolutely clear.          \"(The) President seems to welcome the help again,\" Schiff alleged, adding, \"And so we must make all efforts to harden our elections infrastructure, to ensure there is a paper trail for all voting, to deter the Russians from meddling, to discover it when they do, to disrupt it and make them pay.\"          It's not just lawmakers and Mueller saying the Russians want to meddle again. FBI Director Christopher Wray said it during his own testimony on Capitol Hill Tuesday, but he said the bureau has the problem in hand.          \"The Russians are absolutely intent on trying to interfere with our elections through the foreign influence,\" Wray told the Senate Judiciary Committee. And he added they're still at it. \"Well, my view is until they stop, they haven't been deterred enough.\"          He said that the FBI handles efforts to deter foreign influence and they don't need any new laws to help.          Trump joked with Russian President Vladimir Putin this year about it.          But it is very much an active cyber war.          Democrats say the spreading of false information and other efforts by Russians to interfere are a massive and continuing issue. While leaders in the party are split over whether to pursue impeachment hearings against Trump for obstructing justice, they are united behind a new proposal to secure elections.          And there is bipartisan support for efforts to make campaign ads more truthful and to require citizens to report offers of election help for foreign actors.          But these proposals seem to be going absolutely nowhere at the moment.          Democratic senators came to the floor shortly after 6 p.m. ET Wednesday to ask for unanimous consent to pass three different election security bills they have authored, two of which would require campaigns to report to federal authorities any attempts by foreign entities to interfere in US elections, and a third aimed at protecting from hackers the personal accounts and devices of senators and some staffers.          In keeping with GOP arguments that Congress has already responded to election security needs for the upcoming election, Hyde-Smith of Mississippi objected to each unanimous consent request.          \"The Democrats would like to nationalize everything,\" McConnell said on Fox News in June. \"They want the federal government to take over the election process because they think that would somehow benefit them.\"          That election security has taken on such a partisan tinge might be some of the lasting effect on US democracy that Mueller is talking about.\n",

      "Donald Trump Gave Russia Leverage Over His Presidency\n",
      "Consider the implications. At the very beginning of Trump’s presidency, as soon as he lied in that press conference, Vladimir Putin and Russian intelligence possessed the ability to unmask Trump as a liar to the American public, revealing damaging information to Congress and the public about which they had previously been ignorant. BuzzFeed’s account of the negotiations involving a potential Trump Tower in Moscow hints at the wealth of documentary evidence that the Russians would possess to back up their claims.          As it would turn out, that was merely the beginning of their leverage. In September 2017, Donald Trump Jr. gave sworn Senate testimony that may be contradicted by Thursday’s revelations, raising the prospect that the Russians have been in possession of evidence suggesting that the president’s son may have committed a felony. And once Cohen lied to Congress about the matter, the Russians were in a position to expose the unlawful behavior of Trump’s personal attorney.          Those particular bits of Russian leverage over Trump are gone now that Robert Mueller’s investigation has revealed the truth to Congress and the public. But there is so much that we still don’t know about the Trump Tower deal, the president’s role in negotiating it, and the reasons his inner circle took extraordinary legal risks to hide the truth about it.          “The Kremlin knows the answer to these questions,” says Susan Hennessey, a former National Security Agency lawyer, on a Lawfare podcast. “And unless the answers here are the most innocent possible explanations … if it’s anything other than that, the United States is in an incredibly dangerous position, because the United States is in a position where the American president is aware that a hostile foreign adversary potentially has devastating—politically devastating and potentially legally and criminally devastating, if not for him, then for members of his family or organization—that a hostile foreign adversary has that information on him, and those really are the kinds of conditions where your worst nightmare is about blackmail and influence.”          Perhaps the public will ultimately learn why Trump and some of his closest associates lied about business opportunities that they were pursing in Moscow during the 2016 election. But the mere fact that they did lie, for whatever reason, gave a powerful geopolitical adversary at least some leverage over an American president and his son. And Trump knew about the leverage as soon as he lied to the public about Russia, and again when he watched his son and his then attorney lie to Congress, raising the stakes to a matter of clear criminality. Elected officials have resigned in disgrace for less serious transgressions.\n",

      "Russia is main suspect in mystery attacks on U.S. diplomats in Cuba\n",
      "WASHINGTON — Intelligence agencies investigating mysterious \"attacks\" that led to brain injuries in U.S. personnel in Cuba and China consider Russia to be the main suspect, three U.S. officials and two others briefed on the investigation tell NBC News.          The suspicion that Russia is likely behind the alleged attacks is backed up by evidence from communications intercepts, known in the spy world as signals intelligence, amassed during a lengthy and ongoing investigation involving the FBI, the CIA and other U.S. agencies. The officials declined to elaborate on the nature of the intelligence.          The evidence is not yet conclusive enough, however, for the U.S. to formally assign blame to Moscow for incidents that started in late 2016 and have continued in 2018, causing a major rupture in U.S.-Cuba relations.          Since last year, the U.S. military has been working to reverse-engineer the weapon or weapons used to harm the diplomats, according to Trump administration officials, congressional aides and others briefed on the investigation, including by testing various devices on animals. As part of that effort, the U.S. has turned to the Air Force and its directed energy research program at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, where the military has giant lasers and advanced laboratories to test high-power electromagnetic weapons, including microwaves.          Although the U.S. believes sophisticated microwaves or another type of electromagnetic weapon were likely used on the U.S. government workers, they are also exploring the possibility that one or more additional technologies were also used, possibly in conjunction with microwaves, officials and others involved in the government's investigation say.          The U.S. has said 26 government workers were injured in unexplained attacks at their homes and hotels in Havana starting in late 2016, causing brain injuries, hearing loss and problems with cognition, balance, vision and hearing problems. Strange sounds heard by the workers initially led investigators to suspect a sonic weapon, but the FBI later determined sound waves by themselves couldn't have caused the injuries.          This year, one U.S. worker in China was diagnosed with similar symptoms after hearing bizarre sounds in Guangzhou, and more from China are being tested.          The precise motive remains unclear, but the incidents have driven a wedge between the U.S. and Cuba that has led Washington to remove most of its diplomats and spies from the island. Early in the investigation, senior U.S. officials raised the possibility the illnesses were unintended consequences of some new spying technology. But the fact the incidents continued long after they became publicly known has cast doubt on the possibility that the damage was accidental.          In testimony before Congress last week, State Department officials were unanimous that the incidents should be considered \"attacks.\"          \"The State Department has come to the determination that they were attacks,\" Ambassador Peter Boode, who leads the task force responding to the incidents, told a House Foreign Affairs Committee panel.          A U.S. official separately tells NBC News that the U.S. has \"no reason to believe this was anything but an intentional act.\"          If Russia did use a futuristic weapon to damage the brains of U.S. personnel, it would mark a stunning escalation in Russian aggression toward Western nations, compounded recently by the use of a military-grade nerve agent to poison an ex-spy and his daughter in Britain. Although the full extent of the resulting diplomatic fallout is difficult to predict, a determination that Russia was behind the Cuba attacks would trigger outrage in Congress and foreign capitals and calls for an immediate, concerted response, especially as President Donald Trump faces continued questions about his willingness to challenge Russia and President Vladimir Putin.          Russian government officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.          In a statement, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, \"The investigation is ongoing. We have made no determination on who or what is responsible for the health attacks.\"          The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.          After initial publication of this story, Cuban officials blasted it as irresponsible via Twitter. Carlos de Cossio, director general of the Cuban Foreign Ministry's U.S. Department, tweeted, \"Cuba does not act and does not allow anyone to act against the diplomats of any country in its territory.\" Cuban ambassador to the U.S. Jose Ramon Cabanas said it was \"painful to see how NBC News echoes others to mount speculation without evidence, using dark sources. … Where are Cuba sources?\"          On Cuban television, de Cossio said the U.S. has not produced any objective evidence that attacks of any kind occurred in Cuba, and that the \"scientific community\" has rejected successive U.S. theories about the source of the alleged attacks. \"The way in which the United States government has dealt with this matter of the supposed health damages to its diplomats is worrisome,\" he said. \"From the beginning, it has been handled with a high dose of political manipulation. For more than a year and a half, the State Department has launched specific accusations against Cuba without any evidence whatsoever supporting those claims and without any credibility.\"          The strong U.S. suspicion that Russia is behind the incidents means that Cuba's government is no longer considered the likely culprit. Still, officials did not rule out the possibility that the Cuban intelligence services may have offered the Russians some level of cooperation or tacit consent. Russian intelligence agencies operate in force in Cuba, as do Chinese spies, officials say.          Cuba's government has repeatedly denied any knowledge of or involvement in attacks on Americans in Cuba, and has argued there is no evidence the attacks even took place. The U.S. maintains that whoever perpetrated the attacks, Cuba bears responsibility for failing to protect U.S. diplomats on Cuban soil.          Although the U.S. has never disclosed their identities, officials tell NBC News that in addition to State Department diplomats, the victims include multiple CIA officers, at least one member of the U.S. military, and representatives of other agencies.\n",

      "Tillerson talks Russia with members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee\n",
      "Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with a handful of House members and staffers for seven hours Tuesday to discuss President Donald Trump's foreign policy decision-making, including on issues related to Russia.          Tillerson served roughly a year as America's chief diplomat before the president fired him in March 2018. Still, he had a hand in several major policy matters, including how to deal with challenges from North Korea and Iran.          A congressional aide confirmed that Tillerson met with New York Rep. Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, the panel’s top Republican. House staffers also joined the conversations.          The talks, which were first reported by The Daily Beast, covered \"a wide range of topics including Russia and the foreign policy decision-making in the administration,\" the aide said.          The aide described the gathering as an interview of Tillerson, adding that the former secretary of State reached out to the committee and volunteered for a sit-down after learning members were interested in talking to him.          It was unclear whether the discussions touched at all on the topic of Russia's suspected support of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of those allegations.          Tillerson, who previously served as the chief executive of ExxonMobil, was not part of the 2016 Trump campaign. He was tapped for Foggy Bottom midway through the transition period.          But he may have insight into how Trump dealt with Russia once he took office. The U.S. president has been criticized for his efforts to curry favor with Russian President Vladimir Putin.          The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tillerson's quiet session with the House members. But generally speaking, Trump has tried to block congressional efforts to talk to or get testimony from his current and former aides.          Trump fired Tillerson after the two clashed on several fronts, including on how to handle the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump abandoned despite reservations from Tillerson. Tillerson is reported to have once called Trump a “moron” behind his back.          Since leaving the State Department, Tillerson has largely avoided the spotlight. But in one appearance, he said Trump had at times wanted to take actions that Tillerson had to explain to him were against the law.          Tillerson was a deeply unpopular figure at the State Department, and many diplomats felt he was too isolated and unwilling to listen to their advice.\n",

      "Bernie Sanders praised segregationist George Wallace as 'sensitive' in 1972\n",
      "Seven years after Martin Luther King, Jr. referred to George Wallace as \"perhaps the most dangerous racist in America today,\" a young Bernie Sanders praised the segregationist Alabama governor.          In an interview with the Brattleboro Reformer in 1972, Sanders, then 31, said Wallace \"advocates some outrageous approaches to our problems, but at least he is sensitive to what people feel they need.\"          Sanders, now a Vermont senator and 2020 Democrat, said, \"What we need are more active politicians working for the people.\"          The 1972 remarks surprised the interviewer at the time, who wrote that \"even though [Sanders] has been labeled a 'leftist radical' by some persons, Sanders had some praise for [Wallace].\"          On other occasions, Sanders was more critical of Wallace and warned about the allure of white identity politics.          At the time, Sanders was in the midst of his first political bid, as a gubernatorial candidate for the socialist Liberty Union Party. During that race, Sanders garnered only single-digit support — the first in a series of losses in bids for political office, before winning the Burlington mayor's office, Vermont's single House seat in 1990, and his current Senate seat in 2006.          Wallace was among the most well-known segregationists of his era. Wallace declared in his 1963 inaugural address as governor — he served three different non-consecutive terms — that he stood for \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\" Wallace won further infamy for standing in the front of the entrance of the University of Alabama, blocking the paths of black students.          He died in 1998 at 79, after becoming a born-again Christian and apologizing to black Americans for his previous policies.          The resurfacing of Sanders's comments come after many Democrats begin fearing his rise in the presidential primary. For nearly a year, most of Sanders's rivals have refrained from directly targeting his long paper trail of controversial statements and positions.          While there was a bipartisan consensus in the 1970s and 1980s against the totalitarian policies of the Soviet Union and Cuba, Sanders regularly touted what he saw as positive aspects of the regimes.          And last year, the Washington Examiner reported on Sanders's history campaigning for the Marxist Socialist Workers party in 1980 and 1984. At one point, Sanders's involvement with the SWP led to an FBI investigation when he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont.          Never an official member of the Democratic Party until his presidential bids in 2016 and 2020, many primary voters view his presidential bids with suspicion.          Sanders never endorsed a Democratic presidential candidate until 1988, when he first had his eyes on federal office. That year, he backed Jesse Jackson. Sanders was first elected to Congress as an independent in 1990 after a failed House bid two years earlier.          In other writings, Sanders expressed concern about the racist fervor of Wallace’s supporters.          \"I came away from these Wallace interviews with two basic feelings. First, that democracy in America (in any sense of the word) just might not make it,\" Sanders wrote in 1972. \"My mind flashed to scenes of Germany in the late 1920's. Confusion, rebellion, frustration, economic instability, a wounded national pride, ineffectual political leadership -- and the desire for a strong man who would do something, who would bring order out of the chaos.\"          The interview and subsequent writings demonstrate the balancing act many on the left faced when dealing with segregationists.          Despite his rivals attempting to capitalize on Sanders's past, other Democratic White House hopefuls have their own racial-tinged history to grapple with.          In 1975, then-Delaware Sen. Joe Biden told the Philadelphia Enquirer that \"the Democratic Party could stand a liberal George Wallace.\"          The following year, however, Biden vowed not to back Wallace should he win the Democratic Party's nomination.          \"If Wallace got the [Democratic nomination], I would support the Republican nominee, if it were Gerald Ford,\" said Biden, then 34 and in the fourth year of his 36-year Senate career, which preceded two terms as President Barack Obama's vice president.          In 1974, Biden also pledged to stop Wallace from winning the nomination in the next presidential race.          \"Over my dead political body is George Wallace going to get it,\" Biden said.          Editor's note: This story has been updated to include other comments Sanders made about Wallace.\n",

      "The Sanders Campaign Rolls On, but How Long Will the Senator Be Recovering?\n",
      "Yesterday brought the dramatic news of Bernie Sanders’ surgery and hospitalization and simultaneous news that the campaign had postponed some commercial ad purchases. This fueled speculation that Sanders 2020 might not be around for much longer. Separately, Slate ran a column by Dr. Jeremy Samuel Faust, an instructor at Harvard Medical School, looking at the publicly released information and concluding, “this was very likely a heart attack.” Faust concludes that if Sanders did not suffer a heart attack, he suffered “unstable angina,” which is basically knocking on the door of a heart attack. Faust wrote that the Sanders campaign would not answer his question on the record. He concludes:          Given that Sanders is running for president at the age of 78, I’d suggest it is perfectly reasonable to want to know whether he has just experienced a heart attack and how extensive the damage was. Patients who have had heart attacks have lower life expectancies and are far more likely to have strokes. If he’s going to continue in the race, he certainly should expect to disclose a bit more information about his health.          Beyond the hospital, the Sanders campaign is operating as if they expect Sanders to be back on the trail in the near future. In Virginia, the Bernie Sanders campaign is still hosting a “Bernie on the Ballot” event for Saturday and is emailing reminders.\n",

      "Sanders promises new jobs for 'tens of millions of Americans' during Democratic debate\n",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., stood by his claim that he would provide jobs for every single American, purportedly ending unemployment in the United States.          His comments came during the fourth Democratic debate on Tuesday when CNN anchor Erin Burnett asked him about his jobs guarantee.          \"You say your federal jobs guarantee is part of the answer to the threat of automation, that tens of millions of Americans could end up losing their jobs. Are you promising that you will have a job for every single one of those Americans?\" she asked.          GROUP USING DEM DEBATE TO DEBUT AD CAMPAIGN ABOUT 'SKYROCKETING' COSTS OF 'GREEN NEW DEAL'          \"Damn right we will,\" Sanders quickly responded. Sanders initially made a jobs guarantee when he released his version of the \"Green New Deal\" in August.          According to Sanders' plan, his sweeping overhaul to combat climate would require 20 million new jobs.          \"These jobs will be good-paying, union jobs with strong benefits and safety standards in steel and auto manufacturing, construction, energy efficiency retrofitting, coding and server farms, and renewable power plants,\" Sanders' plan read.          \"We will also create millions of jobs in sustainable agriculture, engineering, a reimagined and expanded Civilian Conservation Corp, and preserving our public lands.\"          Sanders' ambitious climate plan also included nationalizing the bulk of U.S. energy production and drastically reducing carbon emissions.          He has acknowledged that the effect of his plan would be widespread job losses in the energy industry and promised to provide a slew of public assistance measures to those individuals.          CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP          \"This plan will prioritize the fossil fuel workers who have powered our economy for more than a century and who have too often been neglected by corporations and politicians,\" he said.          \"We will guarantee five years of a worker’s current salary, housing assistance, job training, health care, pension support, and priority job placement for any displaced worker, as well as early retirement support for those who choose it or can no longer work.\"\n",

      "CNN, MSNBC ratchet up attacks against Sanders as Biden surges as Dem alternative\n",
      "Democrats have begun coalescing around former Vice President Joe Biden after he won handily in the crucial South Carolina primary on Saturday, but CNN and MSNBC appear to be renewing their hostile coverage of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who the Democratic establishment reportedly fears will run away with the nomination.          There has been a bitter feud between MSNBC and the Sanders campaign in recent weeks as the self-described socialist began emerging as the clear 2020 front-runner. \"Meet The Press\" anchor Chuck Todd suggested that Sanders supporters were part of a \"digital brownshirt brigade,\" which was condemned by the Anti-Defamation League. \"Hardball\" host Chris Matthews, who suddenly retired from the network Monday night, similarly invoked the Holocaust by comparing Sanders' victory in Nevada to the Nazi takeover of France. He later apologized for those remarks.          The Sanders campaign had been vocally critical of MSNBC's coverage of the candidate. Campaign manager Faiz Shakir accused the network of \"undermining\" the front-runner's candidacy.          “It’s been a struggle to change the tone and the tenor of the coverage that we receive,” Shakir told Vanity Fair. “They’ve been among the last to acknowledge that Bernie Sanders’ path to the nomination is real, and even when it’s become real, they frequently discount it.”          Page Six reported last month that Sanders himself had an explosive confrontation with top MSNBC executives before taking the stage at the network's Democratic debate in Las Vegas, one source saying, “Bernie marched right up to NBC and MSNBC’s head of creative production and began jabbing his finger right in his face, yelling, ‘Your coverage of my campaign is not fair ... Your questions tonight are not going to be fair to me.’ \"          He even sparred with network president Phil Griffin, according to Page Six, telling him, \"Phil, your network has not been playing a fair role in this campaign. I am upset. Is anything going to change?... I hope you will do better.’\"          While it was being reported that Griffin was \"taking the complaints seriously,\" signaling that his network would be turning a new leaf, its coverage of Sanders suggests that the status quo remains.          During its coverage of the South Carolina primary, MSNBC star Rachel Maddow claimed that Sanders \"continues to underperform systematically with black voters\" despite his placing second among black voters in Nevada and his surge among black voters in recent national polls.          On Monday, \"Morning Joe\" co-host Joe Scarborough appeared to pressure former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to get out of the race since he, as he claims, is not \"taking votes away\" from Sanders.          “There’s nobody in America that thinks that Michael Bloomberg is taking votes away from Bernie Sanders. What in the world can be his logic of staying in this race when all he’s going to do is take away votes from Bernie Sanders’ competitors?” Scarborough asked.          However, it's not just MSNBC that is going after Sanders.          Over the weekend, CNN host Michael Smerconish asked \"Can either coronavirus or Bernie Sanders be stopped?\" which was also written in a graphic that was blasted on social media. After facing backlash, CNN told Mediaite, \"The banner was wholly inappropriate and a mistake. We are addressing internally.\"          MSNBC'S HOSTILE COVERAGE OF SANDERS HITS BOILING POINT AS HE SOLIDIFIES FRONT-RUNNER STATUS          CNN was also accused of \"choreographing\" a Biden endorsement with one of its own contributors.          \"Following its first commercial break, Saturday night, after declaring Joe Biden the winner of the South Carolina primary, CNN went right to contributor Terry McAuliffe — the ex-Democratic National Committee chair and former governor of Virginia. McAuliffe... And so — with no numbers yet on the board, but ample evidence pointing to a Biden rout — CNN anchor Anderson Cooper teed up McAuliffe to deliver the big news,\" Mediaite senior editor Joe DePaolo wrote. \"What followed was nothing short of a three-minute Biden commercial, with an unchallenged McAuliffe making the case for his preferred candidate, and — unfathomably — even calling for others to drop out of the race.\"          He continued, \"Joe Biden – prior to a post-South Carolina windfall – could not afford to buy much airtime on CNN. But what he got, in the B-Block on Saturday night, was worth far more than a bushel of 30-second spots... Did CNN, in allowing – and even encouraging – paid network contributor Terry McAuliffe to make his unchallenged endorsement of Joe Biden in the manner that he did, and at the time that he did, intentionally tip the scales in the vice president’s favor?\"          Both MSNBC and CNN gave continuous coverage of Biden's Texas rally on Monday evening, featuring his former competitors Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke, all who gave their endorsements to the ex-vice president.          A CNN panel on Tuesday compared the group of endorsements to the \"Avengers\" being assembled to stop Sanders as the declared supervillain \"Thanos\" in the analogy.          \"CNN and MSNBC are essentially recycling bins of old-guard corporate Democratic establishment figures,\" progressive journalist Jordan Chariton told Fox News. \"The metamorphosis from the cacophony of distraught, befuddled, perplexed faces across television news as Bernie Sanders won Iowa, New Hampshire, and crushed Nevada, to the reinvigorated and commanding voices we're now seeing across the corporate media as Joe Biden won South Carolina, should serve as a case study for future media ethics collegiate courses (if those exist anymore).\"          He continued, \"Watching these partisan, pro-status quo corporatists pretending to be good-faith political analysts is why an overwhelming majority of the country are programmed to think big, substantive change can't really happen in America.\"          CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP          NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck expressed a similar sentiment, telling Fox News \"it's clear as day\" that CNN and MSNBC are \"feeling much more confident about their chances of securing a Biden nomination.\"          \"CNN and MSNBC have circled the wagons around Biden as their savior to defeat Donald Trump,\" Houck said. \"If you're a Bernie Sanders supporter and watching either channel, what was annoyance or even anger either has already or will be coming to a roaring boil.\"\n",

      "Bernie Sanders wants to nationalize at least 30% of the American economy\n",
      "In the ideal America outlined by 2020 hopeful Bernie Sanders, the majority of the economy would be centralized and socialized.          Atop our existing government spending, comprising some 40% of GDP, the Vermont Senator wouldn't just nationalize one-fifth of the economy with a \"Medicare For all\" bill eliminating private health insurance. Under his Green New Deal plan, he would also nationalize most of the energy sector.          At a mere $16.3 trillion, the Sanders plan would go beyond simply spending measures to increase climate-focused research and development. It would literally centralize the means of domestic energy production, supposedly in that process \"creating\" 20 million union jobs in \"steel and auto manufacturing, construction, energy efficiency retrofitting, coding and server farms, and renewable power plants.\"          Sanders states in his plan that he would pay for his Green New Deal, in part, from the $6.4 trillion he expects to earn in revenue through the federal government-operated utilities that he expects will be generating \"green\" power for all of us for the first 12 years of the plan. This revenue includes renewable power that would come online to replace the nation's nuclear capacity, which Sanders wants to phase out, in addition to all fossil fuel sources of electricity.          The energy industry comprises 9% of the American economy. Throw in every associated cost of auto manufacturing, public transit, and sustainable agriculture that the Sanders plan specifically demarcates, and that figure could maybe even double. Between \"Medicare For all\" and the Green New Deal, Sanders is seriously calling for the outright nationalization of 30% to 40% of the American economy.          The senators running for president all jumped on the Squad's bandwagon to co-sponsor the Green New Deal without even knowing what would be in it. Republican Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, effectively cajoled them into voting against it when brought to a floor vote, granting the socialist Christmas list a mercy-killing, and allowing the 2020 hopefuls to return to their empty gesturing on other issues.          But in bringing back a Green New Deal in earnest, Sanders reminds us how far left the Democratic primary has run and the stakes of preserving a free, privately operated economy.\n",

      "New York's move to cancel its Democratic primary gets slammed as 'bad for democracy'\n",
      "The New York Board of Elections on Monday decided to remove Sen. Bernie Sanders from the state’s presidential primary ballot, a move Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner denounced as “bad for the Democratic Party” and “bad for democracy.”          HuffPost‘s Daniel Marans reported that “the board’s two Democrats, co-chair Douglas Kellner and commissioner Andrew Spano… voted unanimously to remove Sanders. The state’s June 23 presidential primary is now canceled.”          “Their decision is bad,” Turner, a former Ohio state senator, told HuffPost. “It has a chilling effect on democracy as we know it, because the ability of the people to weigh in was stripped from them before they had an opportunity to cast a ballot.”          Kellner and Spano said their decision to remove Sanders and cancel the New York presidential primary was motivated by concern for public health amid the coronavirus pandemic, but Stephen Wolf of Daily Kos Elections argued that justification “makes no sense.”          “New York’s downballot primaries are still taking place the same day, and New York recently moved to waive the excuse requirement to vote absentee and mail absentee ballot applications to every registered voter,” Wolf tweeted. “This will dampen downballot turnout.”          “One can’t help but see this as the New York Board of Elections trying to protect machine Dems from insurgent progressive primary challengers,” Wolf added.          The board’s decision came just hours after the legal team representing the Sanders campaign warned New York election officials that removing the Vermont senator from the ballot would “would sow needless strife and distrust, impeding Senator Sanders’ efforts to unify the Democratic Party in advance of November elections.”          “Senator Sanders wishes to remain on the ballot, and is concerned that his removal from the ballot would undermine efforts to unify the Democratic Party in advance of the general election,” Sanders attorney Michael Seymour in a letter to the board on Sunday.          The board’s move was made possible by a provision tucked in a budget measure signed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on April 13 authorizing state election officials to remove from the ballot candidates who are seen to have ended their presidential campaigns.          Sanders suspended his presidential campaign on April 8 but said he wished to remain on the ballot in upcoming primary contests to continue accumulating delegates in an effort to exert influence over the Democratic Party platform.          “While Vice President Biden will be the nominee,” Sanders said at the time, “we should still work to assemble as many delegates as possible at the Democratic convention where we will be able to exert significant influence over the party platform and other functions.”\n",

      "Florida Dems in uproar after Sanders’ Cuba comments\n",
      "Though he’s essentially tied with Trump in Florida polls now, Trump’s campaign says that will change amid a planned saturation ad campaign designed to boil the campaign down to a choice between a conservative and a socialist.          “We’re ready to dump it all on Bernie. But not yet,” said a top Trump campaign official, who was not authorized to discuss internal strategy publicly.          Polls show Bloomberg, prior to the Wednesday debate, was leading in Florida matchups against primary rivals as well as Trump. In the primary, Bloomberg led Biden 26-20 percent with Sanders at third with 13 percent, according to one survey of the primary by Ryan Tyson, the Republican pollster who in Florida.          Sanders’s relatively low standing in Florida contrasts sharply with his top position in national polls and his results in the first three early states. And Sanders might not be so easy to beat as some forecast, Tyson said.          “The Republican Party was overtaken by populism in 2016, so it wouldn’t shock me to see the Democrat Party overtaken by a socialist this cycle,” said Tyson. “He’s got problems with Florida Hispanics but it’ll still be close race here. It’s the nature of our state.”          In at least two South Florida congressional seats, Democrats are as concerned about a Sanders nomination as Republicans are rooting for it. Both Hispanic-heavy districts were won by Democrats in 2018 and now two Republicans are running to unseat them by making socialism a top issue.          After the 60 Minutes interview, Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell that “As the first South American immigrant member of Congress who proudly represents thousands of Cuban Americans, I find Senator Bernie Sanders’ comments on Castro’s Cuba absolutely unacceptable ... The Castro regime murdered and jailed dissidents, and caused unspeakable harm to too many South Florida families. To this day, it remains an authoritarian regime that oppresses its people, subverts the free press, and stifles a free society.”          Last month, when asked about Sanders’s positions and statements about Latin America, Mucarsel-Powell, who is neutral in the primary, declined to comment.          Democratic Rep. Donna Shalala, who is neutral in the presidential primary, also made it clear that she sees Sanders as a problem if he leads the party ticket.          “A Sanders nomination would make it more difficult to win Florida,” said Shalala. “Could I still win with a Sanders nomination? Yes. Would it make it more complicated? Yes ... The majority of voters in the district are not socialist, whether they’re Latino or they’re white.”          Rep. Ted Deutch, another South Florida Democrat, has endorsed Bloomberg. He said Sanders will struggle with Jewish voters in Florida.          “It’s not just socialism. When it comes to Israel, a lot of people are really uncomfortable with the thought of using critical assistance to Israel as some sort of bargaining chip, some withholding aid as a threat to Israel,” Deutch said. “For a candidate who runs in Florida and talks to the pro-Israel community, when they hear a candidate saying maybe we ought to ... withhold aid to Israel to make some sort of political statement, that’s something that’s going to concern a lot of people.”          Sanders has already drawn fire in Iowa and Nevada from a political group called Democratic Majority for Israel, and it’s eyeing Florida as well. The group’s strategist, prominent Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, wouldn’t discuss strategy but pointed out that Sanders got some of the smallest support among Jewish Democratic voters in a last month. A new Siena College poll Trump doing better among Jewish New Yorkers than Sanders, who was born in Brooklyn to a Jewish family.          As he has with discussing socialism, Sanders points out there’s a nuance in his position on Israel. At a Nevada town hall Tuesday, he said he opposes the government there, not the nation.          “To be for the Israeli people and to be for peace in the Middle East does not mean that we have to support right-wing, racist governments that currently exist in Israel,” Sanders said, winning loud applause from the audience.          Sanders’s adviser, Weaver, said Jewish voters will be attracted to Sanders as a historical figure.          “We would hope that they would want to come out and see the first Jewish president elected in the United States of America,” Weaver said, adding that voters of all kinds will reject the “smears” that Sanders is anti-Israel or a property-seizing communist.          “People aren’t going to fall for this,” he said. “It’s red-baiting.”          But to Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy, who represents a Central Florida battleground district, Sanders’s comments are “ill-informed & insulting to thousands of Floridians. Castro was a murderous dictator who oppressed his own people. His ‘literacy program’ wasn’t altruistic; it was a cynical effort to spread his dangerous philosophy & consolidate power.”          “Whether the subject is Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Israel or other foreign policy challenges,” Murphy, who backs Bloomberg, on Twitter, “@SenSanders has consistently taken positions that are wrong on the merits and will alienate many Florida voters now and in the general election if he is nominated.”\n",

      "‘The Worst Possible Scenario’: Never Trumpers Wonder What to Do About Bernie\n",
      "At least one speaker at the summit thought the entire Never Trump panic about Sanders was overblown. “I’ll vote for Bernie in a heartbeat,” Will Wilkinson, a vice president at the Niskanen Center, a “post-libertarian” think tank, said. Wilkinson identifies as a liberal these days, but he argued that his onetime allies should resist going Never Bernie. “Some of it’s coming out of this vestigial ‘better dead than red’ Cold War attitude that doesn’t really apply to [Sanders] in a useful way,” Wilkinson told me. “I really tried to reinforce that because of the polarization and dysfunction—but also just the heterogeneity of the Democratic coalition—he won’t be able to consolidate Democrats around him in the way Trump has been able to do with Republicans, because the Democratic coalition is much more diverse ethically but also ideologically.”          “Congress is way more moderate than [Sanders],” Wilkinson added, “so he’s not going to be able to have agenda control. You’re going to end up with much more moderate versions of anything he wants.”          This is the logic motivating several Never Trumpers who say they are planning to vote for Sanders over Trump if—to their unending horror—it should come to that. Frum, a senior editor at The Atlantic who spoke during Saturday’s luncheon, is in that camp. He tweeted in late January that he would vote for Sanders “as a forlorn gesture of protest” against Trump.          “One problem at a time,” Frum told me when I asked him how he would respond to conservatives who see Sanders as an unacceptable alternative. \"We have to deal with this problem”—meaning Trump—“and then we deal with the next problem. This problem is so pressing and so urgent. One problem at a time.”          Nichols, a professor at the Naval War College and prominent Twitter pundit, called Sanders “a silly old crank,” noting that he’d been one of the senator’s constituents while living in Vermont in the 1990s. As much he opposes a socialist agenda, Nichols said, “I know how to argue against policies like that. I don’t know how to argue against mendacity as a policy.”          But, like Frum, Nichols believes Sanders would lose to Trump. “The Democrats have a talent for finding a way to lose an election to the worst candidate in the world, but that doesn’t mean you throw up your hands in frustration,” Nichols told me. “We are all pleading with the Democrats not to put us in this situation.”          Miller said Trump distinguishes himself from Sanders because the president is “a bigot” with character “as low as any person I’ve encountered in my life.” It’s part of why Miller would also vote for Sanders over Trump, though he stressed that the choices of Never Trumpers at Saturday’s summit weren’t representative of Republicans across the nation.          “I think there’s a tendency to talk about all of us in here, who are in the MSNBC green room and write for The Bulwark,” he said. “That’s great. We have outsized public profiles. But there are a ton of Trump-skeptical or Trump-hostile conservative Republican voters out in the country, and I think Bernie will be uniquely ill-suited to getting them.” Miller was specifically thinking of those who voted for Clinton, McMullin, Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, or a write-in candidate in 2016—many of whom are found in and around cities like Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Detroit, he said.          “They’re pure swing voters, totally up for grabs, and Bernie is by far the weakest,” he added. “He’s got a super narrow path. He’s either got to sweep the upper Midwest or bring another old blue state like Iowa or Ohio back on the map, because he’s off the board in Florida, almost certainly off the board in North Carolina and Arizona.”          Whatever their divisions over Sanders, most of the Never Trumpers at the summit were united in their opposition to the president—and how he’d transformed the American right. “His presidency has undermined trust in institutions, sown bitterness and extremism, and further radicalized the Democratic Party,” Charen told the crowd. “It seeks to destroy objective standards in favor of blind leader-worship. It subverts our commitment to the rule of law and to the truth. It tosses aside concerns about a mounting national debt and forgets everything we've learned about excessive government power.”\n",

      "Sanders' anti-superdelegate push gains steam in Senate\n",
      "A growing number of Democratic senators support reforming the party’s superdelegate system — a move that would dilute their own power in the presidential nominating process but satisfy Bernie Sanders and his millions of supporters as Democrats move to unify for the general election.          Politico interviewed nearly 20 of Sanders’ colleagues over the past week and found a surprisingly strong appetite for change, including among influential members of the party establishment such as Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), a top prospect for vice president. More than half the senators surveyed support at least lowering the number of superdelegates, and all but two said the party should take up the matter at next month’s convention in Philadelphia, despite the potential for a high-profile intraparty feud at a critical moment in the campaign.          The findings point to growing momentum among Democrats for changing a system that’s been criticized for giving party bigwigs undue sway over the nominee at the expense of the grass roots. But powerful Democratic Party constituencies, including the Congressional Black Caucus, are firmly opposed. And lawmakers who are open to reform disagree over how far-reaching it should be.          “It’s not useful to anyone to be in a position where you could potentially overturn the will of the electorate. I mean nobody likes this, and it undermines public confidence,” said Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who has spoken privately to a dozen other Democratic senators about the matter. His support for scrapping superdelegates isn’t shared by a majority of the Senate Democratic Caucus, but it could be a starting point for negotiations.          Some senators declined to comment, not wanting to alienate activists or party bosses. And a significant number of Democrats said they’re fine with however it plays out but just want to put the drama over nominating rules to rest.          “I want Bernie in the fold, I want him enthusiastic,” said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, another potential VP choice. “I’m fine with whatever they negotiate, I just don’t care about superdelegates. I don’t care about the whole thing.”          The 714 superdelegates — members of Congress, governors, state party chairs and other Democratic elites — are meant to give battle-hardened Democrats a steadying hand on the selection process, as a bulwark against a candidate who might rouse the grass roots and romp to the nomination but end up being a poor general election standard-bearer.          But Sanders and his supporters argue the system gives too much power to party elites and could lead to a scenario in which members of Congress defy the will of voters. At points during the campaign, Sanders argued that Hillary Clinton might not have been able to win without superdelegates, though ultimately they were not the difference-maker.          Even Donald Trump has knocked the Democrats’ rules as undemocratic.          The sustained push by Sanders supporters, combined with Clinton’s interest in winning over his backers, is likely to push the issue onto the agenda in Philadelphia.          “It’s something we should debate,” said Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware. “There’s probably a middle ground somewhere between get rid of every single superdelegate and maintaining the status quo.”          The conflict over party rules started brewing many months before any primary or caucus votes were cast. A number of Democrats in Congress who serve as superdelegates lined up behind Clinton, giving her a significant delegate lead even before the Iowa caucuses. After the New Hampshire primary, the inherent conflict was evident: Sanders crushed Clinton in the Granite State, but the state’s Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen, had already endorsed Clinton.          That rankled many in the party, particularly liberals.          “I’d like to see the Democratic Party be as democratic as possible,” said Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.          Her view is shared by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and a clutch of other liberal lawmakers. But they have powerful opposition.          The Congressional Black Caucus and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the future Democratic leader, oppose tinkering with the system. CBC Chairman G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina said he was “outraged” to even hear about it, arguing that “eliminating superdelegates would be discriminatory and prevent African-American officeholders from participating in the convention.”          “I’m fine with the superdelegates,” Schumer said in an interview. “Caucuses harness the energy of individual people, they’re legitimate. Superdelegates harness those who worked in the party a long time. I’m for having a nice mixture.”          Given the resistance of Schumer and other longtime senators like Bill Nelson of Florida, proponents of eliminating the superdelegate system altogether may just be making an initial bid ahead of the talks in Philadelphia. Several supporters of reform said it’s more realistic to get rid of some superdelegates but not scuttle the system altogether.          Some Democrats argued that Republicans might have been well served by having superdelegates this year.          “They might have been able to prevent Trump. So I think that superdelegates play a big role,” said Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico, who supports eliminating half the party’s superdelegates. “If Trump ends up being a disaster, [Republicans] are going to try to figure out … ‘How do we prevent this from happening [again]?’ And my guess is the way they will do it is come up with something like a superdelegate model.”          Another problem for those looking to kill the two-tiered system? Politicians usually stubbornly resist efforts to water down their own power.          “Asking a superdelegate to get rid of themselves?” asked Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, who wants a commission to examine party rules. “I would like to hear more from the grass roots than my colleagues on this.”          Plus, if superdelegates were eliminated, senators who wanted to attend the convention could be faced with the awkward situation of running for delegate slots against their own constituents. The CBC made that argument in letters to party leaders over the weekend, and several senators raised the specter of ugly jockeying for delegate slots.          “It’s complicated. Congress-people, do you want them at a convention? How do they get to a convention? Do you want them to run against somebody in the district?” asked Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, who is willing to entertain some reforms.                    Some party officials are looking for a workaround. One option under discussion is binding superdelegates’ votes to the results in their state.          “Having party leaders participate is fine but I think having some connection to the outcome of your state’s process is smart,” said Kaine, a former Democratic National Committee chairman.          “It’s important that the elected officials [and] party leaders have an official role in the party conventions. I’m not as concerned about their votes affecting who the nominee is at our convention,” said Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland.          The Sanders and Clinton campaigns declined to comment.          It’s unclear, though, whether Sanders and his supporters would accept a middle ground. Democratic Party officials in a number of states, including Wisconsin and Maine, have already taken votes in favor of scrapping superdelegates.          That could make it hard for progressives to accept a half-measure.          “We should get rid of superdelegates entirely,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the only senator to endorse Sanders. “There are a tremendous number of delegates who feel like these superdelegate votes are fundamentally inconsistent with the soul of the Democratic Party.”\n",

      "Why Bernie Sanders’ “Political Revolution” Doesn’t Have a Chance\n",
      "When asked for a theory of change—and how he’ll move the United States toward “democratic socialism” as president—Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has a simple answer. He’ll inspire a “political revolution.”          “Now, in my view, the only way we can take on the right-wing Republicans who are, by the way, I hope will not continue to control the Senate and the House when one of us [is] elected president,” he said at Tuesday’s presidential debate. “But the only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together.” Sanders will build so much enthusiasm and inspire so many voters that he’ll come to office with the votes he needs to pursue his plans.          But there’s a problem. We’ve seen this story before.          Barack Obama entered office on a Democratic wave. He won a strong majority of the popular vote—flipping Republican states like Indiana and North Carolina—and helped Democrats win 255 seats in the House of Representatives and 56 seats in the Senate. With a sure mandate and a largely unified party, Obama was primed for success. And he got it, sort of. Over two years, Congress passed an ambitious stimulus package, health care reform, financial reform, and a bevy of smaller measures, from the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to a bill to reduce the crack and cocaine sentencing disparity.          At the same time, this was a slog. Despite an economic crisis and a supportive public, Obama couldn’t win Republican support for major policies. Just three Republicans crossed the aisle to vote for the stimulus, and one of them switched parties in the face of a backlash from GOP voters in his state. Without Republican support—and facing filibusters at every turn—Obama had to corral every Democrat, which gave leverage to centrist and conservative Democrats like Sens. Joe Lieberman, Ben Nelson, and Evan Bayh. It’s how we got the “Cornhusker kickback” (which was later removed from the bill).          It didn’t matter that party voters were behind Obama and his priorities; if the White House didn’t accommodate every Democrat, its agenda would stumble and fall. And even after Democrats won 60 seats—Al Franken entered the Senate in the summer of 2009—the challenge remained. We can criticize Obama for everything he didn’t do as a legislative leader, but the truth is that his plans were steered, in large part, by the right flank of the Democratic Party.          Put differently, President Obama entered office under the best circumstances for any Democrat since Lyndon Johnson won a landslide in the 1964 presidential election. Yet his core priorities nearly crashed on the rocks of Republican opposition and political venality.          On Thursday, I argued that both Hillary Clinton and Sanders need to give plans for executive branch action, given gridlock in Congress. In response, on Twitter, some Sanders supporters said this was wrong: That Sanders—with a long career in lawmaking—could win Republican support; that Sanders would use the bully pulpit to rally voters; and that a Sanders win would necessarily bring the kind of wave that would give him votes for his policies.          But this is blind to reality. Compromise is a distant shore. The Democratic Party has moved to the left, and the Republican Party has made a sharp turn to the right, guided by two generations of conservative revolutionaries, from Newt Gingrich to the Tea Party tidal wave of 2010. If you watched the Republican and Democratic debates back to back, you’d be forgiven for thinking they described two different countries. What’s more, as demonstrated by the GOP presidential race—as well as the leadership fracas in the House of Representatives—many Republicans (57 percent, according to the Pew Research Center) reject compromise full stop. The world where Donald Trump and Ben Carson lead the GOP presidential race is not a world where Republican voters would support a Democratic president or assent to his policies.          The presidency is polarizing. When you step onto its field, you become a polarized figure. Indeed, the “bully pulpit” does more to tear people apart than bring them together. For all of his legislative success, President Sanders would be just as divisive as President Obama, who was just as divisive as President Bill Clinton. You can’t avoid this; it is baked into the cake of ideological politics. Conservatives are just as sincere with their beliefs as liberals. And they’ll reject a Sanders agenda in the same way that liberals would reject Sen. Ted’s Cruz’s plans.          If compromise is off the table, then what about the “political revolution?” It’s possible. Sanders might bring a wave of new voters to the polls and secure Congress for Democrats. But as we saw with Obama, this gives you nothing in particular. The Democratic Party contains the vast majority of America’s liberals, but it isn’t a liberal party. It is a coalition of different groups and interests, from civil rights organizations and labor unions to banks, businesses, and countless voters spanning a massive country of distinct regions and areas.          Sometimes, they hit the same notes and play the same song. But more often, they’re discordant. There’s no guarantee that a group of senators from states as different as New York, Massachusetts, Florida, North Carolina, and West Virginia will agree to vote with Sanders on breaking banks and creating free college education. Not because they’re in league with oligarchs but because people—even people on the same side—disagree, and those people get a major say in how we run government.          What happens to a Sanders agenda if he doesn’t have a Democratic Congress? What happens if he has one but has to compromise to the bone to win? What happens if it fails?          Sanders is a remarkable candidate who has inspired a lot of people to get involved and change the country. He’s the first socialist to gain traction in national politics since the first half of the 20th century, and he disrupts the narrow scope for ideological debate in the United States. But he’s also a politician, subject to the same forces as his peers, and neither he nor his allies can ignore the structural realities of American politics. If Sanders wants to be president, he needs a serious theory of change. Otherwise he’ll flail—and he’ll fail—and his supporters will wonder what happened.\n",

      "Elizabeth Warren says Biden’s response to Tara Reade claims were ‘credible and convincing’\n",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Monday said that Joe Biden’s response to the sexual assault allegation levied against him by a former aide was “credible and convincing,” according to reports.          “I saw the reports of what Ms. Reade said, I saw an interview with Vice President Biden. I appreciate that the vice president took a lot of questions, tough questions. And he answered them directly and respectfully,” Warren said, according to Fox News and a CNN reporter.          “The vice president’s answers were credible and convincing,” she added.          The Massachusetts lawmaker was referring to Biden’s interview Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” where he made his first public statement on Tara Reade’s allegation that he sexually assaulted her in a Senate hallway in 1993 when she worked for him.          “It is not true. I’m saying it unequivocally – it never happened. It didn’t. It never happened,” Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said.          Warren also expressed her support for the former veep and his presidential run.          “I support the vice president, I support his campaign, and I’m proud to endorse him for president,” she said.          Her statements came as President Trump told The Post that Biden “owes” Warren the top spot on his ticket.          “I think Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Joe Biden’s win because she didn’t drop out and [Vermont Sen.] Bernie [Sanders] would have won every single state on Super Tuesday,” Trump said from the Oval Office, claiming Warren split the progressive vote.          A poll last week found that Warren is the heavy favorite among Democrats to be Biden’s running mate.\n",

      "Trump Campaign Responds To Biden’s ‘You Ain’t Black’ Comment: ‘Racist And Dehumanizing’\n",
      "The attacks against former Vice President Joe Biden have been coming from all sides after he told Charlamagne Tha God that black voters “ain’t black” if they don’t pull the lever for him in the November election.          After social media had its way with the presidential candidate, Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign and leader of its Black Voices for Trump group, denounced the comments as “racist and dehumanizing,” arguing that they were indicative of white liberal privilege.          “White liberal elitists have continuously dictated which black Americans are allowed to come to the table and have a voice,” said Pierson, whose statement was posted on the Trump reelection campaign website. “It is clear now more than ever, following these racist and dehumanizing remarks, that Joe Biden believes black men and women are incapable of being independent or free-thinking. He truly believes that he, a 77-year-old white man, should dictate how black people should behave. Biden has a history of racial condescension and today he once again proved what a growing number of black Americans and I have always known — Joe Biden does not deserve our votes.”          Lara Trump, campaign adviser to the president, also tweeted on Friday, “WHAT IF DONALD TRUMP HAD SAID THIS? Will Joe Biden get a pass on this??? I had to watch 3 times to make sure I actually heard what he said.”          Though President Trump has not personally responded to the comments, Donald Trump Jr. had a field day mocking Biden. “Based on [Biden‘s] racist & dehumanizing comments today, I know he thinks he knows more about being black (despite being on the wrong side of every issue that matters to the black community throughout his whole career),” he tweeted.          In an appearance on the “The Breakfast Club” on Friday, Biden made his comment when he told host Charlamagne Tha God told Biden needs to come back on his show to answer “more questions” pertaining to black American issues.          “You’ve got more questions?” Biden replied. “Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.”          Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), said that Biden’s comments only show he has been taking “the black community for granted.”          “1.3 million black Americans already voted for Trump in 2016. This morning, Joe Biden told every single one of us we ‘ain’t black.’ I’d say I’m surprised, but it’s sadly par for the course for Democrats to take the black community for granted and brow beat those that don’t agree,” Scott said.          Symone D. Sanders, Joe Biden’s campaign adviser, instantly came to his defense, arguing he made the comments in “jest” while citing his past record with black Americans.          “Vice President Biden spent his career fighting alongside and for the African American community. He won his party’s nomination by earning every vote and meeting people where they are and that’s exactly what he intends to do this November,” Sanders tweeted. “The comments made at the end of the Breakfast Club interview were in jest, but let’s be clear about what the VP was saying: he was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump’s any day.

      "Ukraine’s Top Prosecutor Says He Will Review Case Linked To Hunter Biden\n",
      "Ukraine’s top prosecutor announced Friday that he will review a case that involves former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden.          Prosecutor general Ruslan Ryaboshapka, who was appointed in August, announced at a press conference Friday morning that he will review several cases including a criminal case that involves a natural gas company Burisma Holdings, according to the New York Times. Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma Holdings until earlier this year.          Ryaboshapka did not specify at the press conference how long his audit would last and emphasized that he is investigating 15 different cases, including investigating wealthy Ukrainians.          “The key words were not Biden and not Burisma,” he said, according to the Times. (RELATED: 42% Of Americans Think The Bidens Should Be Investigated For Conduct In Ukraine, Poll Shows)          “The key was those proceedings which were closed or investigated by the previous leadership,” Ryaboshapka said, adding, “In this large number of cases, there may be ones with these two words.”          Ukraine’s top prosecutor also said that he has not received any phone calls or undue pressure, and told reporters “I have no such information” when asked if there was evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden.          “No foreign or domestic politicians, officials or people who are not officials called me and tried to influence my decisions on specific criminal proceedings,” he said. “The prosecution service is beyond politics. We are conducting an audit of all cases, including those which were investigated by the previous leadership of the prosecutor’s office.”          If any laws were violated, Ryaboshapka said Ukraine will “react accordingly.”          Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine, and Joe Biden’s subsequent alleged involvement, have made headlines since President Donald Trump said he discussed the matter with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call. Democrats subsequently launched a formal inquiry into Trump’s impeachment.          “I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,” Trump told Zelensky.          “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I guess you have one of your wealthy people … The server, they say Ukraine has it,” Trump added.          Trump mentioned the Bidens later in the conversation.          “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it,” said Trump, adding, “It sounds horrible to me.”          Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "CURL: Are Democrats Secretly Trying To Take Out Biden With Trump-Ukraine Scandal?\n",
      "One huge question looms large over the so-called Trump-Ukraine scandal, and here it is:          Why would the Democrats go after President Trump for allegedly threatening to withhold U.S. aid to Ukraine when their proposed 2020 standard-bearer did EXACTLY THE SAME THING — and is on tape admitting it?          There are only two answers, and both might deliver the same result: Democrats either don’t care what happens to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, or they’re intentionally trying to take him out.          Biden has been a weak candidate from the outset. While the comparatively moderate career politician appeared to be perfectly positioned when he stepped into the race for the Democratic Party nomination in April, a slew of other contenders were running hard left, promising free everything for everybody. That left the middle uncontested for Biden.          Since then, though, the “inevitable” nominee has blundered his way back into the pack.          The former vice president is still at or near the top of most polls, but few Democrats are jazzed up for Joe (but then, it’s hard to imagine voters getting excited about any of the others in the whole sad pack of wannabes).          Still, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is rising fast in the polls, and Sen. Bernie Sanders pulled in $25 million last quarter, putting him atop the pile. The race is changing fast.          The way the Trump-Ukraine scandal has played out so far has certainly appeared to favor Trump (some conspiracy theorists speculate that the master troller set up the entire thing).          Remember: Originally, the allegations were that Trump demanded at least eight times in a phone call that Ukraine investigate the business dealings of Biden’s son Hunter.          When Trump released the transcript of the call, it turned out there was just one time that the president asked for “a favor.”          But by then, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and all the other top Democrats had already decided to move forward with an impeachment inquiry.          As the smoke clears around Trump, Biden is left standing in the crosshairs. And this fact has emerged: Hunter Biden made hundreds of thousands of dollars through his employment with Burisma, the largest private gas company in Ukraine — despite having no known qualifications for the job. And when word spread that a prosecutor was looking into the matter, then-Vice President Biden demanded that the prosecutor be fired. That’s a fact.          More, Biden is on tape discussing his push for the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, bragging he had threatened to withhold $1 billion until Shokin was canned. “If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,” he says he told Ukrainian leaders. “Well son of a bitch, he got fired,” Biden says with a smile in the video clip.          That’s exactly what Trump is accused — accused, mind you — of doing. Weeks before Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump put on hold $391 million in aid. He says he did so to pressure other nations to contribute more money and to take time to examine programs. Democrats, though, say it was a clear quid pro quo: Dig up some dirt on Biden and his son, or no money.          But The New York Times’ Kenneth Vogel posted an interesting statement on Twitter last week in the midst of the mess. “The Ukrainians weren’t made aware that the assistance was being delayed/reviewed until more than one month after the call,” he wrote. So, no quid pro quo.          Worse, a photo emerged Monday showing Biden and his son playing golf with executives from Burisma. Not good.          It’s certainly too early to tell whether Trump will emerge unscathed from yet another scandal, but regardless of his fate, Biden’s star is greatly dimmed. And while House Democrats will get in lockstep to vote to impeach Trump, the Senate will be a whole different kettle of fish.          During the trial of the president, Republicans will target Biden and his son nonstop. It’s highly unlikely 22 Republicans will join Democrats to vote to convict, but Biden will be heavily damaged.          That may have all been part of Trump’s master plan. He knew the transcript didn’t show a quid pro quo, and the whistleblower complaint, now also public, doesn’t amount to much, either.          And maybe, just maybe, Democrats knew that this scandal would also take out Biden. If they did, they could well be right. Even better, if Biden gets crushed in the playout of the Ukraine scandal, they’ll have no blood on their hands.          Former Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli said Tuesday that the Ukraine allegations will hurt Biden.          “It is hard to imagine a Democratic primary electorate witnessing this spectacle of $50,000 a month to Hunter Biden, the contradictory information about whether there was consultation with him and his father, the rather unseemly view of this, that the Democratic primary electorate is going to decide this is our guy,” said the former senator from New Jersey.          “The Torch” wasn’t right about much when he was in the Senate, but he could well be spot on with this prediction.          *Joseph Curl ran the Drudge Report from 2010 to 2014 and covered the White House for a dozen years.

      "BIDEN: I ‘Probably’ Shouldn’t Have Challenged 83-Year-Iowan To Push-Up Contest\n",
      "Joe Biden was in the midst of his “No Malarkey” tour across Iowa when some old guy tried to give him some malarkey.          But Uncle Joe wasn’t having any of that there malarkey. Not one spoonful.          The 77-year-old former vice president was confronted by an 83-year-old farmer on Friday during a New Hampton, Iowa, town hall.          “We all know Trump has been messing around in Ukraine,” the man said, then added: “You, on the other hand, sent your son over there to get a job and work for a gas company and [who] had no experience in natural gas. You’re selling access to the president just like he is.”          Biden exploded. “You’re a damn liar, man. That’s not true. And no one has ever said that,” Biden said as he approached the man menacingly.          Then Biden, as he does, challenged the man. “Let’s do push-ups together here, man. Let’s run. Let’s do whatever you want to do. Let’s take an IQ test.”          The former frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination went on to defend his son, who got paid $83,000 a month for serving on the board of a Ukrainian state natural gas company while Biden was vice president. “No one has said my son has done anything wrong,” Biden said, adding that he “did not on any occasion” do anything wrong and that “no one has ever said it.”          “I didn’t say you were doing anything wrong,” the man said.          “You said I set up my son to work on an oil company,” Biden fired back. “Isn’t that what you said? Get your words straight, Jack!          The man said he heard it on MSNBC, which caused Biden to explode again.          “You don’t hear that on MSNBC! You did not hear that at all,” Biden said. “Look, I’m not going to get into an argument with you, man.”          Then Trump called the man “fat” (or sure seemed to, anyway, although Team Biden said the candidate said “facts”).          But it turns out the 83-year-old guy doesn’t take any malarkey, either.          “You don’t have any more backbone than Trump does,” he said.          “Any other questions?” the annoyed Biden said.          “Well, I’m not voting for you,” the man said.          “Well, I knew you weren’t,” Biden said. “You’re too old to vote for me.”          Biden now says maybe he shouldn’t have confronted the man.          “I probably shouldn’t have challenged him to pushups,” Biden said, according to Axios reporter Alexi McCammond.          Symone Sanders, a senior Biden campaign official, tried to explain what happened.          “Let’s be clear RE: the exchange VP Biden had with a voter in Iowa earlier today: 1) the gentleman is a self-identified Warren supporter who said he would vote for the VP in a general election 2) his facts were flat-out wrong and 3) the crowd backed VP Biden up in his response,” Symone Sanders wrote on Twitter. “Any assertion VP Biden said a word about the gentleman’s appearance is making this something it is not. In the latter part of the exchange, the VP began to say ‘Look, facts’ then said ‘here’s the deal.’ If you’ve been to a Biden event, you’ve heard this before.”          “The reality is this – a reference was made to the ‘news’ today and I think we all know which outlet has continued to peddle the debunked conspiracy theories cooked up by Trump and Rudy Guiliani about Ukraine. These lies will not go unchecked & we’ll continue to lay out the facts,” she wrote.\n",

      "‘This Is About Justice’: Biden Ties Economic Revival to Racial Equity\n",
      "As he seeks to unite and energize his party around his candidacy, he has sought input from a broad range of experts and officials, including from a series of task forces assembled with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, his liberal primary rival.          But Mr. Biden, the former vice president, continues to confront a lack of enthusiasm from some progressive voters, and while he won the primary with strong support from African-American voters — in particular, older ones — he faces challenges generating excitement among some younger voters of color. In the primary campaign, he was not the choice of many liberal activists of color, and he still faces skepticism from some of them about whether he can sufficiently address their concerns.          Mr. Trump, for his part, has sought to portray Mr. Biden as hostage to an extreme left wing of the Democratic Party, whose extravagant spending would wreck the nation’s economy.          The plan Mr. Biden unveiled touched on a wide range of economic issues. It emphasizes support for small-business owners of color, promising that he will “leverage more than $150 billion in new capital and opportunities for small businesses that have been structurally excluded for generations,” including by increasing access to venture capital and low-interest business loans.          Mr. Biden, who has long faced anger from some voters over his leading role in the 1994 crime bill, which many experts link to mass incarceration, also addressed some criminal justice matters in the plan. He would aim to help states improve their criminal justice data infrastructure so they can automatically seal criminal records for certain nonviolent offenders.          The plan also said that he would try to amend the Federal Reserve Act “to require the Fed to regularly report on current data and trends in racial economic gaps — and what actions the Fed is taking through its monetary and regulatory policies to close these gaps.”          The Fed, which influences the speed of economic growth and the unemployment rate with its interest rate policies, already regularly discusses racial and ethnic economic outcomes in its reports and testimonies. It has shied away from targeting any specific group’s unemployment rate when setting monetary policy, despite a growing chorus suggesting that it ought to consider targeting the Black jobless rate, which has historically remained higher for longer.\n",

      "Rubio does himself no favors with weak defense of Trump scandal\n",
      "When Donald Trump’s Ukraine scandal first broke two weeks ago, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) responded with lazy partisanship, telling Fox News the real controversy was Joe Biden getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired to protect his son.          Even those who’ve come to expect very little from Rubio were struck by the pitiful response. As the Florida Republican must know, the former vice president – representing the bipartisan position of the United States and much of the Western world – targeted an inept prosecutor who wasn’t pursuing a company Biden’s son was associated with. Rubio’s reflexive effort to defend Trump by smearing Biden didn’t even make sense.          This week, however, the GOP senator was handed a great opportunity to redeem himself. Rubio has earned a reputation as a fierce China critic, so when his party’s president publicly sought Beijing’s assistance in targeting a domestic opponent yesterday, it offered the Floridian the chance to do the right thing, put country over party, and rebuke Donald Trump’s obvious abuse.          Alas, as the Miami Herald reported, the senator chose a different path.          [W]hen President Donald Trump on Thursday publicly called on China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 rival, Rubio said Trump’s words were a ruse. “I don’t know if that’s a real request or him just needling the press knowing that you guys are going to get outraged by it,” Rubio told reporters at an economic opportunity event in the Florida Keys on Friday. “He’s pretty good at getting everybody fired up and he’s been doing that for a while and the media responded right on task.” […] “I don’t think that’s a real request. I think he did it to gig you guys [reporters],” Rubio said. “I think he did it to provoke you to ask me and others and get outraged by it. He plays it like a violin and everybody falls right in, that’s not a real request.”          As Republican talking points go, this comes up from time to time as a way of shrugging off assorted Trump abuses. Last year, for example, when the White House went after the security clearances of former intelligence officials who’ve criticized the president, then-House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters, “I think he’s trolling people, honestly.”          In that example, Ryan may have had a point; Trump didn’t actually follow through. In the effort to compel foreign officials to help the president’s re-election campaign, however, Rubio, in a rather literal sense, doesn’t appear to know what he’s talking about.          In fact, if there’s one thing that even the most unobservant Republicans should understand at this point, it’s that Trump wasn’t just popping off on Twitter or during an impromptu Q&A. The president and his team hatched a deliberate scheme, involving a variety of officials and offices, in the hopes of trying to coerce campaign assistance out of foreign governments.          Trump wasn’t trolling or trying to get a rise out of reporters; the media didn’t even know about the president’s efforts until reports of a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower came to the fore.          On the White House South Lawn yesterday, Trump didn’t speak with a wink and a nod. There was no smirk. No one on his team came forward later in the day to suggest the president was just joshing. What we saw was real: the American president, desperate and afraid, publicly appealed to foreign countries to do his re-election campaign a favor – again.          Trump could’ve walked it back, and suggested this was all just a joke that journalists failed to understand, but he instead published a follow-up missive claiming an “absolute right” to pressure foreign governments to target those he deems corrupt.          It’s the sort of thing Marco Rubio should care about. His indifference says quite a bit about how the Florida Republican approaches his weighty responsibilities, and none of it’s good.\n",

      "Biden moves to lock down Dems. Next up: Elizabeth Warren\n",
      "In the span of just 48 hours, Joe Biden put to rest a major question surrounding Democratic efforts to win back the White House: 2020 will not be a repeat of 2016.          One after the other, Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders threw their support behind the former vice president — with Elizabeth Warren soon to follow, according to sources familiar with the discussions.          The rapid consolidation behind Biden offered the most powerful evidence yet of the party’s intent on avoiding the deadly fractiousness that contributed to Donald Trump’s victory four years ago.          “If there’s one thing we’ve learned as a country from moments of great crisis, it’s that the spirit of looking out for one another can’t be restricted to our homes or our workplaces, or our neighborhoods or our houses of worship. It also has to be reflected in our national government,” Obama said in a nearly 12-minute video message released Tuesday.          “The kind of leadership that’s guided by knowledge and experience, honesty and humility, empathy and grace,” he continued. “That kind of leadership doesn’t just belong in our state capitals and mayor’s offices. It belongs in the White House. And that’s why I’m so proud to endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States.”          The quick succession of endorsements so soon after Sanders dropped out of the race provided a rebuke to Trump’s attempts to sow discord within the party; the president has repeatedly sought to raise doubts about Obama and Sanders’ true allegiance to Biden.          The endorsements also underscored Biden’s role as a coalition builder, which Democrats intend to hold up as a major contrast to Trump.          Obama and Sanders struck similar notes in their remarks, contrasting Trump’s leadership style — which they characterized as self-serving, dictatorial and dangerous — to Biden’s, calling him compassionate and experienced.          Biden’s aides pointed to the significance of the timing of the events, noting this is the earliest that a Democratic nomination has been conclusively wrapped up since 2004.          In its outreach to former rivals, Biden’s campaign has repeatedly argued that it was the bitter intra-party divisions of 2016 that contributed to Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the fall. Disaffected voters, including many loyal Sanders supporters, stayed home in 2016.          All along, Biden has steadily collected the support of his major competitors by noting that he intends to serve as a bridge to the next generation of Democratic leadership. In recent weeks, the former vice president has taken on a more expansive role as the presumptive nominee and head of the party.          He has been careful to praise Sanders effusively, adopted major policy proposals from Warren and pledged to set up policy committees with Sanders to help adopt platforms that emerged from the Vermont senator’s progressive movement.          Biden’s efforts to unite the party included chiseling away at the iciness between Warren and himself. The two have personally spoken numerous times since Super Tuesday — and several times in recent weeks — sources familiar with the conversations say. The Massachusetts senator’s endorsement is “coming soon,” those sources said, and is merely awaiting a green light from Biden’s camp.          Obama’s highly anticipated foray into the 2020 race after declining to back a candidate during the primary contest delivered a welcome bite of the news cycle — no small accomplishment during the coronavirus pandemic.          While widely expected, it represents a new phase in the general election campaign against Trump, unlocking the Democratic Party’s most powerful surrogate for Biden at a time when his campaign has struggled to cultivate momentum against the backdrop of the outbreak in the U.S.          Although Biden maintained during the primary that he had asked Obama not to endorse any particular Democratic candidate — insisting that “whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits” — he relentlessly invoked his eight years of service under the former president and warm, personal relationship with him to court voters.          Biden’s efforts to align himself so closely with Obama, even as the previous administration’s policies came under occasional scrutiny from the party’s left flank, were ultimately successful in propelling him past more progressive rivals to become Democrats’ pick to challenge Trump in November.          His tenure as Obama’s No. 2 also contributed immeasurably to Biden’s firewall of support among African-American voters and proved foundational to the campaign’s argument that the former vice president was a capable leader ready to assume the responsibilities of the Oval Office.          Weighing in on the endorsement Tuesday, Brad Parscale, Trump’s reelection campaign manager, asserted that Obama “spent much of the last five years urging Joe Biden not to run for president out of fear that he would embarrass himself,” and now “has no other choice but to support him.”          “Obama was right in the first place: Biden is a bad candidate who will embarrass himself and his party,” Parscale said in a statement. “President Trump will destroy him.”          As a historically crowded and diverse field of White House hopefuls competed for the Democratic nomination over the past year, Obama’s public statements and remarks on the state of the race were closely parsed for potential clues regarding his preference of candidate and aspirations for the future of the party.          When Biden officially entered the race last April, the former president’s spokeswoman said Obama “relied on the vice president’s knowledge, insight and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency,” and added that the two men “forged a special bond over the last 10 years.”          In November, Obama memorably warned a group of liberal donors that the “average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it,” arguing that voters “just don't want to see crazy stuff” and “are not driven by the same views that are reflected on certain, you know, left-leaning Twitter feeds.”          He also reportedly urged Democrats later that same month to “chill out” about the party’s pool of candidates and expressed suspicion toward “purity tests during elections.”\n",

      "Joe Biden’s Iraq problem\n",
      "Joe Biden says that when deciding whether to vote in favor of invading Iraq in 2002, he took President George W. Bush at his word and was led astray.          “[Bush] looked me in the eye in the Oval Office. He said he needed the vote to be able to get inspectors into Iraq to determine whether or not Saddam Hussein was engaged in dealing with a nuclear program,” Biden told NPR in September, explaining his Senate vote. “He got them in and before you know it, we had ‘shock and awe.’”          To hear the former senator and vice president tell it, Biden was one of the many high-profile Democrats who voted to authorize the Iraq War after the 9/11 attacks, only to regret it immediately after.          But his record, well documented in speeches on the Senate floor, congressional hearings, and press interviews from 2001 through his time in the White House, is that of a senator bullish about the push to war who helped sell the Bush administration’s pitch to the American public — and of a vice president who left an unmistakable imprint on President Barack Obama’s backing of a dictator in Iraq.          Biden, whose campaign didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment, is one of two 2020 Democratic presidential candidates — the other being Sen. Bernie Sanders — with congressional records that stretch back to the start of the Iraq War. In the fall of 2002, Biden committed what anti-war activists call the “original sin” by voting for the war when he was chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. Sanders, then a member of the House of Representatives, was vocal in opposition.          Those close to Biden describe his record on Iraq as one less moored in policy than in personal connections. Biden has long touted a dedication to working on the inside, maintaining civility and forming bonds with even those he vehemently disagrees with. That’s his formula for making change.          “There’s plenty of room to criticize him, but I don’t think this a purely cynical case of revisionism,” one former Democratic Senate aide told Vox about his Iraq record. “The sense in the Senate was that there was a pathway out of this thing, and the Bush administration blew it.”          But Biden’s fiercest critics point out that the timeline doesn’t add up. Lawmakers knew from the beginning the shakiness of the Bush administration’s case for going to war with Iraq, and Biden not only went along with it, he championed it.          Now a decade and a half later, as voters decide if Biden should represent the Democrats against Trump, they will have to decide if Biden’s checkered history with Iraq may impede him from the ultimate prize. Some have already made up their mind.          “What’s the central reason that Congress approved the war? Key Democrats like Biden crossed over and made a deal with Bush,” says Robert Naiman, with the anti-interventionist Just Foreign Policy group.          Biden voted for — and helped advance — the Bush agenda          The simple truth is that Biden voted to give Bush broad power to go to war with Iraq. He did so as a top-ranking Democrat in the Senate: the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And he did so at a time when the majority of Americans did not support taking immediate military action.          How he got to that point involves several twists.          The Bush administration’s campaign for war powers began in the summer of 2002. Vice President Dick Cheney declared definitively that Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction — a claim echoed by American intelligence officers, who were called to Congress to detail those weapons, and by the media outlets who quoted them. As we know now, those claims were based on flimsy evidence and turned out to be incorrect.          Bush also said he needed war authorization to add teeth to a diplomatic effort through the United Nations to get inspectors on the ground in Iraq. But the administration wasn’t prioritizing diplomacy; they were asking for a broad war authorization that gave the White House immense freedom to use military force in Iraq.          Biden bought into the Bush administration’s argument. He elevated the administration’s concerns about Hussein in the press. And in the months leading up to the vote authorizing war, he organized a series of Senate hearings, in close coordination with the White House, during which he echoed the administration’s talking points about weapons of mass destruction.          “In my judgment, President Bush is right to be concerned about Saddam Hussein’s relentless pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and the possibility that he may use them or share them with terrorists,” Biden said at an August hearing.          “These weapons must be dislodged from Saddam Hussein, or Saddam Hussein must be dislodged from power,” he continued. “President Bush has stated his determination to remove Saddam from power, a view many in Congress share.”          Those hearings have been characterized by his supporters as Biden’s attempt to seriously and methodically weigh the price of war. And, to be sure, Biden did note: “If that course is pursued, in my view, it matters profoundly how we do it and what we do after we succeed.”          But, as has been reported in progressive outlets, the hearings included scant testimony from skeptical anti-war voices. And throughout them, there was vocal opposition among Biden’s Democratic ranks.          “The administration’s arguments just don’t add up,” Sen. Russ Feingold said on the Senate floor in October 2002. Sen. Paul Wellstone similarly raised concerns, questioning a lack of planning on the Bush administration’s part to account for the potential fallout from military action. He also raised questions about the potential death toll not only among Americans, but also Iraqi civilians, and the billions of dollars that would have to go toward a rebuilding effort.          Biden’s skepticism, however, was largely reserved for the Bush administration’s specific ask: a catch-all war authorization for Iraq. Biden supported a narrower war power authorization prioritizing the WMDs. He joined Republicans Sens. Richard Lugar and Chuck Hagel, the latter of whom would go on to be Obama’s defense secretary years later, in crafting an amendment to the war authorization to limit the scope of Bush’s powers.          But another Democrat foiled that effort: Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, struck a deal with Bush to authorize the use of military force in a war — a move that angered Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate, including Biden. Gephardt, at the time weighing a presidential run, was accused of playing politics.          The vote in the Senate was held on October 11, 2002. The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution passed the Democrat-controlled Senate 77 to 23; 29 Democrats voted in support, including Biden. The final resolution gave Bush broad power to go to war in Iraq.          “The President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq,” it reads.          In the hours of debate that preceded the vote, Biden echoed the Bush administration’s rhetoric.          “I do not believe it is a rush to war but a march to peace and security,” Biden said on the Senate floor. “I believe failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war would occur.”          Bush declared the start of the war in March 2003 with a campaign of hundreds of airstrikes on military targets intended to “shock and awe” Hussein and his forces. By May, Hussein’s government had fallen, and Bush had declared “Mission Accomplished.”          But it was only the beginning.          In Biden’s retelling, the war authorization was only a means to strengthen Bush’s position in diplomatic talks. But to Bush, it was clear the war authorization was more than just diplomatic strategy — a sentiment reflected in Biden’s own rhetoric at the time. Congress had given Bush broad power to use military force, and he did.          “I think Biden really did believe that getting a United National Security Council resolution would have gotten the inspections,” the former Senate aide said. “Pretty early on he understood that the situation was not going well. The Bush administration was signaling that we won this thing and Biden, Chuck Hagel, and John McCain were three credible voices saying there’s something else going on here.”          Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 2002 midterm elections, meaning Biden also lost control of the Foreign Relations Committee chair. The following years for Biden, until Democrats retook control in 2006, were defined by his close relationships with Republicans like McCain, Hagel, and Lugar, who chaired the Foreign Relations Committee. They travelled to Iraq together, did press tours together, and praised each other’s judgment (though Biden’s relationship with McCain would eventually sour in the run-up to the 2008 election).          During this time, Biden’s position was that the war was “vastly underfunded and undermanned,” as he told PBS in June 2003. “We’re so woefully unprepared because of judgments made from the failure to plan before we went in of what we were going to do in the aftermath.”          In July 2003, Biden during a Senate hearing pressed then-Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and two other top officials about the administration’s low-balling of costs to fund the war, asking, “When are you guys starting to be honest with us?”          But even then, Biden wasn’t entirely critical of the decision to invade Iraq.          “We have town councils set up. There is actual nascent democracy beginning to flourish there. The oil fields didn’t get blown up. There is relative peace in the north,” Biden said in a July 2003 interview with CNN:          Meanwhile, the Bush administration’s claim that Hussein had amassed weapons of mass destruction was collapsing. Former diplomat Joseph Wilson wrote in the New York Times that same month that he’d found nothing when the CIA sent him to Niger to investigate claims that Iraq had tried to buy uranium there.          In October 2003, Iraq Survey Group inspector David Kay told Congress that they “have not yet found stocks of weapons.” In July 2004, a Senate intelligence report found that the US intelligence community’s prewar assessment of Iraq’s WMD capabilities had been deeply flawed. A British report that same month also found no evidence of WMDs. The final CIA report came out in late September 2004: Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction.          And then Biden changed his story. “I never believed they had weapons of mass destruction,” he said at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank in October 2004. That statement looks a lot like either a lie in the moment or an inadvertent admission that he had lied in the run-up to the war.          It would be one thing if Biden’s Iraq legacy ended there. But he would only add to it — perhaps in even grander ways — from inside the White House.          The trajectory of Biden’s vice presidency changed dramatically during a June 2009 national security meeting in the Oval Office. “Joe, you do Iraq,” President Barack Obama said, turning to his No. 2. With that, the charge to end the war in Iraq — one of Obama’s signature campaign promises — was Biden’s responsibility.          Those in Obama’s circle say Biden was handed the Iraq portfolio because Obama trusted his years of foreign affairs experience and knowledge about the country. Others were a little skeptical due to Biden’s Senate record, including his advocacy for splitting Iraq up into three separate regions.          But Iraqis who worked with the Obama White House at the time felt there was another reason Biden got the nod: The president didn’t want to wade into what he viewed as his predecessor’s mess.          “They dealt with us as a legacy and baggage,” a senior Iraqi official told Vox, asking for anonymity to speak freely about his interactions with the previous administration. “They weren’t comfortable dealing with Iraq.”          “Biden was more comfortable working with us than the president was,” the official said.          There was no question who spearheaded Iraqi policy in the early days of the Obama administration: By 2014, Biden had made 64 calls to Iraq. Obama, meanwhile, had only made four. It’s why many blame Biden for what happened next — the backing of a brutal sectarian leader, the withdrawal of US troops, and the rise of ISIS.          But debate still rages in Washington and foreign capitals: Was he given an impossible task to manage as best he could, or did he repeatedly make the wrong calls when they mattered most?          Nouri al-Maliki, a Shia Muslim, became Iraq’s US-backed prime minister in 2006 as the country descended into civil war. He was no one’s idea of a perfect choice, but he did (at least initially) help the US clamp down on widespread violence as the Bush administration sent in a surge of troops in 2007 to quell it.          Biden was against the surge in the Senate. “I totally oppose this surging of additional American troops into Baghdad,” Biden said in 2006, just before becoming the Foreign Relations Committee chair once again. “It’s contrary to the overwhelming body of informed opinion, both inside and outside the administration.”          Maliki’s assistance, mainly in the form of squashing violent Shia militias, would help him stay in America’s good graces for Bush’s final years. He and Bush would even hold weekly video conferences to keep up to date, though the Iraqi premier used the time mostly to gripe about the problems he faced in parliament and the nation writ large.          But it wasn’t until the end of the Bush era and the start of Obama’s presidency that US officials began to seriously question whether Maliki could lead the divided nation.          Starting in 2008, Maliki “began a systematic campaign to destroy the Iraqi state and replace it with his private office and his political party,” Ali Khedery, a former top US diplomat in Baghdad who was close to Maliki, wrote in the Washington Post. Maliki did this by firing professional military leaders he deemed disloyal and replacing them with cronies. He even forced Iraq’s chief justice to ban some of his top political rivals from participating in crucial 2010 parliamentary elections.          Despite his best efforts, Maliki’s State of Law Coalition lost by only two seats to Ayad Allawi’s al-Iraqiya group in that vote. The result gave neither party a clear majority to lead the country, and there was genuine worry in Washington and Baghdad that negotiations to form a ruling coalition could take a year or longer. That was a major problem, as the US needed someone in power to reauthorize a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) in 2011 allowing American troops to stay in Iraq with certain legal immunities and basing authorities.          So the key question became: Support the winner Allawi, or continue to back Maliki? “It really was heavily in flux after that election,” Robert Ford, the deputy US ambassador to Iraq from 2008 to 2010, told Vox about the debate inside the American government.          Top US officials, including Ford and James Mattis, then the top US general for the Middle East, pleaded with Biden not to side with Maliki. By that point violence around the country hadn’t gone away but was manageable, and many thought it was the time to focus on reconstruction and economic issues in Iraq. They felt Maliki, who was increasingly acting as an authoritarian, wasn’t the guy to lead the country forward.          “Prime Minister Maliki is highly untrustworthy, Mr. Vice President,” the former Trump defense secretary recalls saying in his new book Call Sign Chaos.          Emma Sky, who was the political adviser to Army Gen. Raymond Odierno, the leader of US troops in Iraq, recounted to me a meeting she had with Biden in August 2010. “Iraqis had voted for change,” Sky, a British national, argued to the vice president, “and you have to show people that change can come about through politics, otherwise they’ll revert back to violence.”          “And he goes on about how Al Gore really won the 2000 presidential election,” she continued. “He kept giving these analogies that weren’t exactly appropriate.”          But for Biden it was appropriate. As many who came to understand Biden’s thinking told Vox, he viewed Iraq through two prisms. The first was that its political problems were similar to those in America, where even the highest tensions between Shia and Sunni Muslims in Iraq could be overcome like political squabbles between Democrats and Republicans in the US. That led to the second prism, which was that the key to solving Iraq’s issues was to get its people over their ancient hatreds.          “Look, I know these people,” Biden told Sky in that August 2010 meeting. “My grandfather was Irish and hated the British. It’s like in the Balkans. They all grow up hating each other.”          That view bothered Sky. “He really felt he understood Iraq,” she told Vox. “That’s pretty scary because even experts are surprised about what Iraq is like.”          “I don’t think Biden is a great intellect. He relies on his instincts and feeling,” Sky continued.          That sense seems to have led Biden to back Maliki, despite some advice to the contrary. Part of that was because Biden and others in the administration knew the Iraqi premier well enough to work with him, despite his faults.          “There was a very strong contingent that said Maliki is that devil we know,” Jeffrey Feltman, who headed the State Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, said of Biden and others in an interview with the Atlantic in June.          The other reason is that Maliki had more political backing in Iraq to stay in power than Allawi had to take it, as even some of Maliki and Biden’s critics admitted to me. The Shia firmly supported Maliki — as did Iran — and it was difficult for Allawi to gain enough support to take over.          Due to Biden’s backing of Maliki, the US helped to broker a deal that would see him retain the premiership in December 2010 and lead Iraq, even though his party had technically come in second in the election.          Those close to Biden dispute that the US tilted negotiations in Maliki’s favor, saying there wasn’t another viable option. “There was a lot of opposition to him, particularly among the American military, so I was willing to try to delay this thing and see if we could find alternatives,” James Jeffrey, who became the US ambassador to Iraq in August 2010, told Reuters five years ago. “We never found one.”          Even certain Iraqis see it that way, too. “I think they had no choice but to work with the key players of the time,” the senior Iraqi official told Vox. “The US was stuck, but it wasn’t going to reengineer Iraqi politics.”          Either way, Maliki kept his job — and immediately made the work for the US that much harder.          The US withdraws troops from Iraq — and ISIS rises          In 2011, Maliki knew the US was desperate. It wanted a SOFA so it could keep troops in Iraq, giving service members legitimacy to be there and immunity from Iraqi law.          And the premier also surely knew that Biden believed he’d deliver the desired agreement. “Maliki wants us to stick around because he does not see a future in Iraq otherwise,” Biden said during an October 2010 video conference with advisers. “I’ll bet you my vice presidency Maliki will extend the SOFA.”          But Maliki drove a hard bargain, consistently saying he wouldn’t grant immunity to a single American soldier, which derailed negotiations. One theory for his hardline stance, as former US diplomat in Iraq Barbara Leaf posited to the Atlantic in June, is that he “started anticipating the end of US troops and the end of people telling him what to do.”          Whatever the reason, the troops agreement — again, one of the main reasons Biden and the rest of the US had scrambled to help organize an Iraqi administration they thought would be friendly to Washington — didn’t come through. The lack of a deal forced Obama’s hand in October 21, 2011, when he ordered the roughly 45,000 US troops in Iraq out of the country by year’s end.          With more freedom to do what he wanted, Maliki for the next few years continued, and in many cases deepened, his sectarian rule. He built a Shia-dominated sectarian state and refused to take steps to accommodate Sunnis, who already felt disenfranchised by their loss of influence after the US pushed them out of power in 2003. Police killed peaceful Sunni protesters and used anti-terrorism laws to mass-arrest Sunni civilians.          Maliki also made political alliances with violent Shia militias, infuriating and terrifying Sunnis.          ISIS cannily exploited that anger and fear to recruit new fighters from disaffected Sunni communities. With the US distracted by the Arab Spring and the growing civil war in Syria, the Obama administration failed to adequately respond to the clear upswell in the terrorist group’s ranks by late 2013.          “I think the criticism of us that we didn’t see the problem is unfair,” Antony Blinken, a top Obama official and now a Biden campaign adviser, told the Atlantic in the June article. “It’s fair to say that we were not effective in dealing with it before the fact.”          When the US did eventually respond, Biden proved instrumental in coordinating it. The US sent warplanes into Iraq to target ISIS’s militants and told Iraqi leaders that more assistance would come if Maliki stepped aside. The sense was that Maliki’s leadership would only make the problem worse — not to mention that his heavy-handed policies had helped set the conditions for ISIS’s rise in the first place.          Despite struggling mightily to stay in power, eventually Maliki stepped down in August 2014. Of course, for some it was too little too late: the US had backed Maliki and withdrew troops that could’ve helped avert disaster.          But the vice president was also a key player in developing the strategy, touted by US generals ever since, to work with local allies to fight ISIS on the ground and retake the territory it had captured in Iraq and Syria — a mission that was eventually completed by the Trump administration in March.          ISIS is still not defeated, and Trump’s policies in Syria might help it make a comeback. What’s more, Iraq still remains in strife, with weeks-long protests rocking the country and threatening widespread violence. The question for many is how much blame Biden shoulders for Iraq’s recent past and current state.          The answer depends on whom you ask.          Everyone Vox spoke to for this story, even Biden’s fiercest critics on Iraq, unfailingly said that Biden then had a warm presence, and came to meetings extremely prepared. Few questioned the former vice president’s dedication to get Iraq right during his eight years at the White House, and made clear that Bush made the original sin of invading Iraq in the first place.          But how wrong, so to speak, did Biden end up being when Iraq was his charge?          Ford, the former deputy US ambassador to Iraq, told Vox that most of the country’s ills that time — particularly ISIS’s rise — was Maliki’s fault.          “I do not blame the Obama administration’s decision to withdraw troops entirely from Iraq” because that’s not what led to ISIS, he said. “What I do blame are the incredibly sectarian policies of Maliki. That, more than anything, is what really led to the spread of ISIS.”          But Sky, the top adviser to the US military in Iraq at the time, thinks the Biden-led Iraq policy under Obama was a total failure with far-reaching implications.          “Biden’s legacy has gotten worse,” Sky told Vox. The Obama administration allowed ISIS to gain strength, fuel instability in Syria, and trigger a refugee crisis that helped foment populist politics in Europe — including a vote in favor of Brexit that Sky says might’ve gone differently otherwise. “In America, you don’t feel the consequences of these wars, you’re far away. But in Europe these problems are all on our doorstep.”          The debate over Biden’s Iraq legacy now rests squarely with American voters deciding whether or not he deserves a shot at the top job. Will his time in Iraq and general foreign policy knowledge boost his credentials, or will the problems that faced the Obama administration haunt his candidacy?          That, like Iraq’s future, is still up in the air.\n",

      "Stay Alive, Joe Biden\n",
      "Voters seem to have coalesced around Biden for his past—who they have known him to be for the past four decades in American politics—rather than for anything in his present. It’s as if Biden exists primarily as an idea, rather than an actual candidate.          Today, as the country (and the world) enters what is likely to be a prolonged period of darkness, left to the mercy of a deadly virus, Biden is grappling with the reality of what he can—and must—do in this hour of crisis, as the man who would like to take over leadership of the United States. Already, this week, there are news reports that his campaign is “in a state of suspended political animation”:          Biden can’t fully pivot to the general election. He can’t truly unite the party’s warring factions. Nor can he begin stockpiling the vast amounts of money he’ll need for November. His momentum has effectively been stopped cold. For the foreseeable future, all live campaign events are canceled, so he can’t hit the stump to try to capitalize on the excitement he had just stoked. His ability to criticize Trump on anything other than his performance on coronavirus response and preparedness is constrained by the emergency-like conditions.          The handwringing over fundraising and campaign events may be beside the point. After all, if you were on the campaign trail for the past three months, what struck you was not Biden’s organization (there was little), or his resources (there were few), or even the campaign messaging (Joe Biden has been—and forever will be—Joe Biden). What was striking was the sense of anguish and urgency articulated by everyone, everywhere, all the time. And that was before the pandemic.          There were the Bernie Sanders supporters on the campus of Florida International University who told me, however reluctantly, that they would vote for Biden because Donald Trump had to be stopped. There were the soccer moms canvassing for Amy Klobuchar in Johnson, Iowa, who made clear that their primary concern (more than Amy’s chances) was whether Trump was going to get reelected. There were the Culinary Workers Union members in Las Vegas who hadn’t been fired up by any candidate in particular, but who told me they felt as if they faced an existential threat from the Trump administration—and that was enough to drive them to the voting booth and pull the lever. There were the older black voters in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who woke up at 7 a.m. to check out Michael Bloomberg, mostly because they were worried that Biden was slipping, and Trump had to be removed—and if Joe couldn’t do it, they said, then they had to find someone else who would.          Almost no one I came across said they were going to vote because someone, anyone, but especially Joe Biden, had made their heart sing. Even Sanders supporters—the ones in the flesh, not online—were clear-eyed about their desire to defeat Trump, first and foremost. Ending the Trump presidency—because of the lies, the cruelty, the indignities, the misogyny, the incompetence, the fraudulence, the corruption, the clownishness, the recklessness, the lawlessness, the selfishness, oh, the list went on—that was something that united men and women across the United States and left them in a state of anguish.\n",
